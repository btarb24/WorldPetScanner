If you can't spot one, try looking in the deeper areas of the narrow waterways around the zone. They like to swim.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>797038</b></h3>Okay, no, seriously, this ain't funny anymore &lt;.&lt; I've checked the SoS like three times on different days, both day and nighttime, and still can't find these buggers!<br />Tracking Pets, displaying Critter names, even gone snorkeling in those filthy waterways - nothing. Nada! I'm starting to feel as though some cruel joke is being played upon me D:<br />FML &lt;/3</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>82728</b></h3>I finally found one! Rushed toward it with a smile of relief on my face. <br />As I was landing some lv 50 Blood Elf Paladin killed it with his random aoe spam. <br /><br />&quot;...&quot;<br />I wanted to spend the next few hours drowning him in the swampwater over and over again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PoshKenneth</b></h3>I traced all the waterways in the main part of the map looking for this, unfortunately didn't find any, although I saw many other players who were obviously also looking for the moccasin.<br /><br />I got bored and decided to check the body of water separated from the rest in the bottomright corner of the map, and was lucky enough to find and capture one, so hopefully that may be of some help.<br /><br />Otherwise I'm afraid it's the old, get rid of all the other ones until it spawns. :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cathistlechaser</b></h3>I caught one at 4 PM, with no weather going on. After reading the other comments, I suspect I got lucky -- I just entered the zone and started following the river and found one (just north of Stonard). Poor quality, but it's one more unique pet!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>449048</b></h3>So, just caught my Moccasin today. I wanted to add to the forum is that this pet did occur regularly in the water. Some of them roaming between water and land. If you have Track Pet location setting turned on on your minimap, you would be able to track them just like other pets. However, as the area also has phases problems, you might found them disappear sometime with other pets. I will submit the screenshot I took for one of them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hawksong</b></h3>Why are these listed in some of the guides as being in Stranglethorn? It seems confusing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maricah</b></h3>Not fun to try and find, this one is also time consuming, ugh. &gt;&lt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DebbiD</b></h3>I followed the waterways and engaged every single pet I found while heading west to east through the Swamp. About 20 pets later near Marshtide Watch I found the first Moccasin, a poor quality one. I accidentally killed it with a dot from my Sporeling Sprout. Luckily just a few yards away I found another one, this time a rare! I was very careful to bring its health down slowly and finally captured my rare Moccasin. Persistence is key. This was in the middle of the afternoon and no weather conditions applied. I think clearing the area of all battle pets helped force a spawn, though I can't be sure of this. Both Moccasins were IN the water not just near it. Hope this helps and good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>493425</b></h3>With a rare spawn like this, killing off other battle pets in the area will spawn new pets, and occasionally it will be the Moccasin too. But be a good sport fellas, and dont kill off any other rares you might find - other players might want them!</div>
