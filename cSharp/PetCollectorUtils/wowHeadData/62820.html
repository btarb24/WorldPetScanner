<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>When up close, and presumably when captured, these tiny elementals have a constant 'babbling brook' sound. I can see it potentially getting on some people's nerves, while others (like me) find it incredibly soothing. This could be a favorite!<br /><br />When clicked, they have a soft rushing, watery growling sound, completely unlike the usual aggro sound of water elementals.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AusSpyder</b></h3>A pet made entirely out of water that is weak to aquatic attacks. It's worth it for the irony alone</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nightwisp</b></h3>These can be found in the Drak'Sotra Fields waterpools just northeast of Rageclaw lake in Zul'Drak.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thoorin</b></h3>These guys are a necessity against most high level pandaren masters, notably Pandaren Spirit Tamers.<br /><br />To beat those masters, you need strong aquatic attacks, but the master's pets have attacks that can nuke your aquatic pets. One option are Snails, like Rhapana Whelk, which have a strong aquatic attack and themselves are critters.<br /><br />Wavelings are also good, because they are elementals but have two strong aquatic attacks. Additionally, they will down-level when captured at worst to 20, so leveling them won't take much effort.</div>
