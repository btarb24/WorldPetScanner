<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rubyfire</b></h3>It took me at least two hours to (I assume) force a spawn for this. When they did spawn, there were three. They were all near where the minnow vac lady hangs out (coast near the western spray). I killed all the ones up and down that area, and the raised area with the waterfall. It is definitely a rare spawn. I was doing this at night so I am not sure if there is any truth to it being a night time spawn or not, but I figured I'd mention that. I left the other two up and hopefully some other pet person found them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cindraeth</b></h3>Thanks for the advice to just use the Operation: Mechagon instance. I tried several resets but didn't get anything. Then I noticed the same lvl 1 &quot;background&quot; pets were always in the same places regardless of the resets. So I killed as many as I could safely reach then reset. A Duskytooth replaced one of the near town kills on my second reset after starting kills.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AllianceHead</b></h3>Holee frackin' crapola, I finally found one! And a blue to boot. Found at 7:30 p.m. realm time, on Bleeding Hollow (Americas). Coords: 80.96, 23.14<br />TY RNGeezus!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>huspomike</b></h3>Wow. Definitely rare. Spent several hours killing Rustyroots trying to make this appear, nothing. Finally set my difficulty to &quot;Heroic&quot; and entered the Dungeon. Dusty appeared in a safe area. Needed to approach from the right angle, so as not to draw new ultra-sensitive baddies. Heroic worked nicely for me, got one!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Incandio</b></h3>The &quot;enter Mechagon and one's there&quot; method didn't work for me. I got mine after about one hour. I made a target macro and killed all the Rustyroot Snooters I could find, pets and critters. After one hour or so a Duskytooth Snooter spawned.<br /><br />The Rustyroot Snooter spawn only in two areas that I could find.<br /><br />1. North-east and east of Rustbolt. There are usually several in and around the Alliance / Horde flightpoints, and around Sparkweaver Point.<br />2. The area where the Hot Air Balloons spawn to the west of Bondo's yard, including the small lake on the hillside and the coast down to about the cave where Rumblerocks appears.<br /><br />I just went back and forth between those two areas and that was enough. Note the macro will target dead snooters but will switch to a live one if one appears.<br /><br />/tar Duskytooth Snooter<br />/tar Rustyroot Snooter</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xeon500cc</b></h3>Dungeon worked great within a few resets. Less than 10. Worth noting his name is &quot;Dusk&quot; and it's night time in the dungeon. Maybe the ones outside are time of day locked.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JELISSA46</b></h3>I tried killing all the Rustyroot Snooters in the Fleeting Forest area for about an hour at a time, for two days in a row with no luck. I also did the Operation Mechagon instance reset on Mythic for the past two days and only ever saw one yellow junkhopper spawn, but I already have that one. Every other time there were no pets spawned, at all. <br />Today I started murdering all the Rustyroot Snooters pets and critters in Sparkweaver Point area as I had read in one of the other comments. <br />After about 15 minutes the Duskytooth Snooter finally spawned at 81.42 , 18.48 .</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>minoter</b></h3>Despite reading that they may have hotfixed mythic mechagon and that the pet does NOT spawn inside, this is incorrect. Took me 5 resets as of 10/10/2023 and it spawned for me. It did NOT spawn behind pascal, as some people have said. Rather it spawned just to the left of the starting area in the grass. And I was immediately able to /tar duskytooth snooter it right after spawning in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thomas4</b></h3>I got a (blue) Duskytooth Snooter - as the first pet in line - in the Fleeting Forest at 46, 26<br /><br />Before and after that I looked in mythic 'Operation: Mechagon' dungeon, but only found another Duskytooth Snooter after about 25 resets when looking for &quot;Yellow Junkhopper&quot; (which eventually I also found in the Fleeting Forest, near the lake at 46, 30)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>GoobTheGod</b></h3>Found one west of Trixie and Naeno in the dungeon</div>
