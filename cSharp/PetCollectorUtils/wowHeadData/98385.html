<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>These creatures spawn only during the day. At night, instead, <a href="/npc=98386/eldritch-manafiend">Eldritch Manafiend</a> spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>Interestingly enough, although the icon on these is dark grey, they are quite brightly glowing silvery grey, while their nighttime counterpart, the <a href="/npc=98386/eldritch-manafiend">Eldritch Manafiend</a>, has a bright orange icon and yet are a dark and shadowy grey. One almost wonders if they got reversed in the NPC creation.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>presin16</b></h3>Every couple hours or so, this guy goes crazy and does about 5 consecutive arcane explosions. It's a nice little touch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>applebear</b></h3>I am not sure if this is just depends on a certain spec in the sky or not, but all the eldritch manafiends I battled were always blue. <br /><br />Now that I know the Eurdites are only out during the day, I haven't found one blue yet. All greys and one green. <br /><br />No theories that I can think of, however these do respawn fast and there is no reason to fret if you accidentally kill one while fighting one of the mobs near by.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Karilicious</b></h3>Erudite Manafiend spawns during the day, Eldritch Manafiend spawns during the night. However, in order to spawn either of these you need to get rid of the other.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Oleros</b></h3>These are necessary for the 3rd quest in the Bloodgazer Hatchling chain. If you came looking for some mobs to kill I'm sorry but you will need to pet battle with your hatchling in order to get credit.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Halux</b></h3>Erudite manafiends spawn at 6:30 am server time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tyranea</b></h3>I'm on an Oceanic realm and I had been stuck on the quest <a href="/quest=44996/hunting-lesson-erudite-manafiend">Hunting Lesson: Erudite Manafiend</a> for several days. I went to the area many times, at all times of the day and night, and I only ever saw Eldritch Manafiends up. I tried realm hopping, battling all pets in the area, killing all pet in the area with a /tar macro, waiting for respawns, and I only ever saw Eldritch Manafiends. I submitted a ticket yesterday about it, wrote in detail everything i'd tried and I mentioned that others on Oceanic realms have had problems with this quest also. I received a standard &quot;cut and paste&quot; response so I ignored that and decided to go back to the area for another look. I arrived at 11.59am realm time (Sydney) and THEY WERE UP! I was so excited that I raced over the the closest one and of course agroed a few mobs which I had to kill before I could start the pet battle. I'm a priest and I used Psychic Scream to avoid taking some damage and it feared the pet as well, which put it in combat and then my champion killed it! (Don't worry, some strong words were had). I stayed in the area for a while to finish this quest, try to find a rare (which I didn't) and do a world quest. <b>They respawned as Erudite Manafiends until 12.30pm realm time (Sydney). At 12.31pm I saw an Eldritch Manafiend up and left the area.</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kirima</b></h3>These spawn at 6:30AM PACIFIC time. I wasted many days before I found this out. I'm on Eastern time and there were none to be found at 6:30AM on my server. It was all Eldritch until 9:30AM, which would be 6:30AM pacific. So I can confirm this is going by Blizzard HQ's timezone. For those on the quest for your Bloodgazer Hatchling, he only needs to be on your team, he does not need to participate in the fight to get credit.</div>
