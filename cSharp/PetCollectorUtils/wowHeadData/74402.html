Bred for rescue duty, the Alterac brewhound's bloodline is famous for having found and resuscitated many mountain travelers trapped beneath the snow . . . and then slobbering all over them. The most famous brewhound of all is Bernard, credited with saving upwards of 50 livesâ€”many of them dwarf and orc soldiers dragged out of the snow beneath the treacherous bridges of Alterac Valley. </div><br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />This will be a Blizzard Pet Store Item, as reported in this article posted on Wowhead 11/19/2013:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/news=224097/alterac-brew-pup-gets-blizzard-store-page-on-sale-soon">Alterac Brew Pup Gets Blizzard Store Page, On Sale Soon</a><br /><br /><div class="quote-box">The <a href="/item=106240/alterac-brandy">Alterac Brandy</a>, which summons <a href="/npc=74402/alterac-brew-pup">Alterac Brew-Pup</a>, just got a special Blizzard Store page: <a href="https://us.battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-pet-alterac-brew-pup" rel="nofollow">https://us.battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-pet-alterac-brew-pup</a>.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Chonar</b></h3>So if you click your newest lil' buddy, you get <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=107499">Mulled Alterac Brandy</a>.<br />Yup, a loyal St Bernard that dispenses alcohol whenever you want.<br />Needless to say, best pet for a dwarf ever. I've named mine Sgt. Slobber.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jessy87</b></h3>after reviewing the pets abilities, i first thought call the pack (edit:) so the call the pack does actually debuff your opponent for +100% damage. The way it was worded on wowhead made me think it was you/him that took the debuff</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>olania</b></h3>I would like to point out that in addition to a standard dog wimper sound when you click on him, he drools. <br /><br />Constantly. <br /><br />Possibly the greatest, most understated animation ever in WoW.<br /><br />And he dispenses booze. Drunken <a href="/achievement=6823/must-love-dogs">Must Love Dogs</a> anyone?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Marilana</b></h3>This pet will also react to you using the /helpme emote on it while having it targeted.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cymre</b></h3>The first thing I noticed was the ability to right-click the pup and receive some Mulled Alterac Brandy. It only took four to get me drunk but you can only hold one in your bag at a time. He even emotes when you target him with /helpme<br /><br />Another pet I had fun levelling tonight over <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL81N0Gga6k" rel="nofollow">6 battles</a>.</div>

If you just use pets as &quot;vanity objects&quot; this feller is the perfect companion. And should you like getting drunk (as everyone else does) this is the cutest little portable bar you will find.<br /><br />Also, drink responsibly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Expinapher</b></h3>&quot;The name &quot;St. Bernard&quot; originates from the Great St. Bernard Hospice, a traveler's hospice on the often treacherous Great St. Bernard Pass in the Western Alps between Switzerland and Italy. The pass, the lodge, and the dogs are named for Bernard of Menthon, the 11th century monk who established the station&quot; From &quot;Dog Owner's Guide Profile: The St. Bernard&quot;.
