<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Garumeg</b></h3>Without doing anything but fighting <s>(forfeiting, actually)</s> the others, it spawned each 15 minutes. I faced 2 commons and 1 poor before finding a rare. From what I've seen, they come with one or two snakes and or toads, but no other sporeling.<br /><br />Edit: Forgot to add that they appear at Sporeggar village, so just camp there and check every 15 minutes. It's just a matter of time before a rare appears.<br /><br />Edit NÂº2: As of patch 5.2, a condition regarding forfeiting has been added. Now, when you forfeit, all your pets take damage equal to 10% of their total life, and the pet you fought won't despawn anymore. Given this fact, I recommend fighting with a team of 3 lvl 25 pets, and have a pet with at least one critter-base mid-powered attack, so that he can take him on without fear of killing him. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63365">Terrible Turnip</a> also works, as his <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=826">Weakening Blow</a> is THE best way to capture anything.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TevishSzat</b></h3>Useful pet. Charge, Leech Seed, Spore Shrooms made a decent tank who could still damage the enemy. For mazimum healing, roll leech seed BEFORE setting up Spore Shrooms so you still deal damage on the turn you lay down Spore Shrooms.<br /><br />I choose charge over Jab because it can throw a monkey wrench in enemy plans, which is very important for PvP pet battles, an environment currently dominated by &quot;Combo&quot; teams.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mewmewface</b></h3>took me forever to find the rare, i think i had to go on several different toons, although that is not a strategy..just saying..the rare does exist but it might take a while. i also had one common and uncommon already and i kept trapping the ones i battled and just released them off.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>223389</b></h3>I would recommend the P/P (power) breed because you have the Charge move which always goes first and the power boost (325) will help your shroom DOTs long after your dead. Also, the Human racial will help rebuild your low HP. If his shield was point based (and therefore would scale with Power) that would be a trifecta.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Florentpraha</b></h3>Guys pls, I was on that location more then 100x, but never find anyone. Why? Rep with sporeggar on frendly... Whats wrong?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1086010</b></h3>Has anyone taken a closer look at his abilities? He has humanoid, elemental, critter and undead abilities. He's the platypus of battle pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Elithe</b></h3>GREAT pet for swap party. <br />Spore Shrooms, after that (when spores are going to be released) Leech Seed and he can very nicely heal yourself even while is idle. <br />You can add <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62317">Infernal</a>'s Immolation (persists through swaps) and Immolate (not persists for enemies, but deals damage up to 4 rounds) and you have real Elemental apocalypse!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1367794</b></h3>Respawn rate of roughly 1-2 hours if you're rare hunting like me.. so if you have multiple characters just have one that's friendly with the spore ppl and check back after every hour.</div>
