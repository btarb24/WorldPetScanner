<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Djongov</b></h3><a href="/item=142098/drudge-remains">Drudge Remains</a> Drops from Lich King in ICC on any difficulty and is part of the achievement <a href="/achievement=11320/raiding-with-leashes-iv-wrath-of-the-lick-king">Raiding with Leashes IV: Wrath of the Lick King</a>. Drop rate seems to be low as i have been on 5 runs and i haven't seen the pet drop. There is a 2nd pet that drops from the Lich King now, also part of the Leash achievement - <a href="/item=142099/call-of-the-frozen-blade">Call of the Frozen Blade</a>. It is rumored to drop only on Heroic difficulty. This means that just to be on the safe side, run ICC on heroic 25 no matter for which pet you go. Good to run with alts as well. If you don't want to waste time because the drop rate on this Raiding with the Leashes seems to be crippling, they are cagable so you can find them in the AH. They are currently quite expensive so even if you have collected them, it might be a good source of gold farming.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AllureMG</b></h3>I just got the pet from 25N after multiple tries (not sure how many on different toons).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dragneyez</b></h3>This pet DOES indeed drop on 25H. It dropped for me while I was trying to get the mount. Surprise since I thought it only dropped on normal, but it does drop on 25H also.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Paladestar</b></h3>I think the people who say it dropped for them on heroic are simply just missing the normal/heroic bug which exists in the game.<br /><br />If you have raid difficulty set to heroic and enter an old raid which only has a normal mode, when you zone out of that raid your raid difficulty menu will still show as heroic selected, but if you then look at the portal of a raid that has a heroic mode, you'll see from the portal animation that it is showing as normal and when you zone in, it indeed will be normal mode.<br /><br />I'm guessing, like me, a lot of people are doing Ulduar just before going to ICC. Ulduar has no heroic mode. So when you come out, your raid difficulty menu will show as heroic, but when you see the ICC portal it will be the normal mode portal animation and if you go in, it will be normal mode. You need to change your raid difficulty menu from heroic to normal and then back to heroic, you'll then see the heroic mode portal animation, go in and it will be heroic.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1678235</b></h3>This doesn't drop in heroic. People saying otherwise are simply trying to troll/keep you in the dark because at lvl 25 this pet easily sells for 50k+ I would know as I've gotten it many times and have been selling it a long time. It drops in 25Normal. Heroic is wicked soul. <br />The only downside is it has an insanely low drop chance as sometimes I will get 0 out of 9 toons and sometimes 1-3.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MapleWarrior</b></h3>Some guy on my server is trying to auction this off for 187K.<br /><br />(To put that in perspective, the two auctions for Wicked Souls at the moment are &quot;only&quot; 1.5K.)<br /><br />Message to anyone considering buying from a guy like this: Running the entire raid yourself is cheaper.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>szpaxon</b></h3>I did actually get this from Heroic 25m ICC</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Throthgar29</b></h3>Just a quick confirmation that this is from normal. I just got it on my first 10N after tonnes of tries from 25HC.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mightylink</b></h3>i got this on 25 h last week then came here to see the comments, i guess nobody is going to believe me, if i knew i would of screenshotted it, i was only trying to get the mount, and im sure i didnt make a mistake, i always check for the skull and 25 on my minimap</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Grim1ok</b></h3>Is this 100% DR on norm? - I got it first time.....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Capchca</b></h3>Just had this drop on heroic summited a screen shot</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gloomi</b></h3>So I just had this drop, surprisingly, on 25m Heroic. I can tell you I'm looking at my Raid Difficulty selector and it absolutely says 25 man Heroic BUT looking at the gear drops I got none of them say &quot;Heroic&quot;.<br /><br />So my best guess is that people who claim to get this on Heroic are like me: it says Heroic but it's actually Normal.<br /><br />Note: if it were Heroic my addons would show an attempt to get Invincible. This didn't show up, which further suggests I'm actually on Normal not Heroic.<br /><br />I don't know why the Raid selector is lying to me. I absolutely set it to Heroic before zoning in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>threninduil</b></h3>FYI, if you buy this off the AH, it does satisfy the requirement for Raiding With Leashes IV.</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
