<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>235986</b></h3>Just a couple of notes on these:<br /><br />They are level 23 and the groups of 3 you can find in Uldum are linked if they all spawn at the same time--as in they are the same group of mobs every time right down to the quality. (This might be the case with the beetles as well but I haven't checked.) This is really awesome if you can find a group with rares in it, as you can get triplets to help with <a href="/achievement=7464/quality-quantity">Quality &amp; Quantity</a>. I tamed 3 identical rare moths and another group of 3 I found had a rare lizard and snake so I was able to get both of them. <br /><br />Two groups of lizards with fast spawn rates are side by side just south of Obelisk of the Sun in the Cradle of the Ancients in Uldum. Just beware that they can respawn while you are in a pet battle and the new spawns will be a different group. <br /><br />If you are going after the lizards at or below level, make sure you bring a full group of higher level pets. They aren't that hard to fight, but they will rip your dragon to SHREDS while you keep trying to capture them as they do massive damage at low health. I had a low level in for the exp and I missed several tames because of it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>Another note on the triple spawns of lizards: you can kill two of them, and when the group respawns, the two which respawn are guaranteed to be tameable, but will now have different 'adds' to the original spawns as well as being different quality. This means if you are grinding your rare lizard, you can kill two of the group, wait for them to respawn, and then check the respawns. I got my rare Horned Lizard by grinding a group of three in this way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>160411</b></h3>According to the Pet Journal, these are captureable in the Badlands and Silithus, which does not appear to be true.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>adashiel</b></h3>It's a bit easier to farm this pet with a character who has not completed the Uldum quest line. The zone is extensively phased, and in many cases, pet spawns are only included in the initial quest phases. You'll still be able to find them around the zone, but Cradle of the Ancients, one of the larger spawns, has no pets at all in its final phase. Neferset is the same way, though it doesn't have as many lizard spawns.<br /><br />Sometimes you'll be able to snag a battle with a pet on the edge of a different phase, but you'll have to be quick. Make sure you bind &quot;Interact with Target&quot; to a key and use that instead of clicking.(##RESPBREAK##)2056##DELIM##adashiel##DELIM##</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pubrulz</b></h3>I found that after doing all the quests in the zone, I was able to find plenty of these (including a rare) around the lake in the NW corner as shown on the map.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>223389</b></h3>There are two distinct color variations: red and white.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Meagogo</b></h3>Just want to help you collectors out there. There are loads of lizard packs (of three) in Cradle of the Ancients. However, they are phased so go there with an alt that havnt done that many quests in the area. They are only visible if the area is light and dry.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>alphasnake</b></h3>Damn, these have proven to be quite difficult for me to get as a rare. <br /><br />I've taken the advice above, brought an alt to Uldum who had not done the quests there at all yet, and flew to Cradle of the Ancients. I've gone around and cultivated multiple packs of 3 lizards by battling 2 and leaving one up. I've killed every other critter in the area, to the point where I had 4-5 groups of lizards up at time, going from one to other, and still no rare. It's been about 3-4 hours so far. I've leveled up 3 pets from lvl 10 to lvl 25 in that time. Ugh, RNG sucks. <br /><br />Still working on it.</div>
