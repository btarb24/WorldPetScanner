The reasons are many.\n\n1. First off, the pokemon here are high-level and you can level on them while you search for a Cat here. I recommend raising alternates this way, making one move and then switching.\n\n2. This is simply the easiest place to find a Cat. While it's true that the pet battles here are few and far between, you get two additional pets joining the battle rather than just one. I would estimate about a third of your battles will have a Cat. It is quicker than camping spawns at Silvermoon, which I would say is the next-quickest.\n\n3. You will be supercalifragilistically happy with the Cat (or Mouse) you get from Netherstorm. I don't want to reveal why, and for the love of Reason don't reply and spoil it. It's not a game balance issue. But you will be very, very VERY [s]happy[\/s] nostalgic for the days of 5.0.5. Don't buy your Meowth anywhere else.\n\nMore Info: There is a single spawn point out on Sunstrider Isle (East, North-ish) that has about a three minute respawn time, and produces rares pretty frequently.\n\nWith the advent of battle-stones, you don't actually need this pokemon at all. It comes in four colours, all of which are obtainable in simple, sad little vendor pets which will be upgradeable to rare and share the same exact moveset:\nOrange --> [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=7384]Cornish[\/url]\nSilver --> [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=7381]Silver Tabby[\/url]\nBlack --> [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=7385]Bombay[\/url] (Side note, why [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=22816]isn't this[\/url] a pokemon? [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=62257]Sand Kitten[\/url] was deemed good enough.)\nSiamese --> [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=7380]Siamese[\/url]\nThat said, you [i]can[\/i] argue that the plain Cat has better possible stat allotments than these cookie-cutter vendor builds (for example, your Siamese Cat will always be exceptionally speedy with no attack to speak of). \n\nThe sad truth, though, is that if a [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=7386]White Kitten[\/url] can become a rare, the plain Cat will never again be sought after.\n\nUPDATE, update, update!\n\n[s]Alright, yes, secondary caught pokemon are colour-changers. [b]This will no longer be the case in 5.1![\/b] And I quote from the patch notes: \"[b]Fixed an issue that would prevent some pets captured in Pet Battles from correctly saving their skin color once added to the Pet Journal.[\/b]\"\n\nCapture your colour-changers NOW if you want one before all is lost. It may be that previously captured colour-changers will be reverted to the default colour (siamese for Cat - you can tell by the pokedex picture on any colour-changer you catch; it shows the default). They may not get reverted, though, if what they did with colour-changing Hunter pets is any indication; they allowed us to keep our tamed colour-changers as colour-changers, but caused wild ones to only ever be the skin they were tamed as, here-ever-after.\n\n@Widge: Definitely a great name for a colour-changing Cat. (Named my 12\/12 Shift, but I might go look for a 13\/10 build too) I may have to steal it. The reason I'm so very hopeful that tamed colour-changers will continue to be so is actually two-fold. First, look at the quote. (bolded it) The issue they've fixed seems to be the one to allow you to capture a colour-changer. The ones without saved skin colours but [i]already added to the pet journal[\/i] might be spared. Secondly, I think it would be pretty difficult to go through [b]everybody's[\/b] pokedex and [b]give[\/b] a specific skin to those Cats without one. It especially might make people upset if their beloved pokemon diligently raised to level 25 is suddenly given an ugly skin. They [i]might[\/i] revert every single one to the default, set a randomiser, or even save the VERY next skin your pokemon appears as its permanent one, but I'm hoping they won't do that.[\/s]\n\nOh well. That was nice while it lasted. All colour-changers now reverted to default skin.","date":"2012-10-03T15:31:49-05:00","rating":70,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Love my new L19 rare Cat I just got 2nd off a Fledgling Nether Ray!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>While you can find these spawns in all the above locations, they might be few and far between finding a battle pet to tame, especially if you're after a rare. However, they show up as 'second pet' fairly often in Arathi, thus making that a good place to farm for your ideal 'cat' pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aliandrin</b></h3>Netherstorm, Netherstorm, and again Netherstorm.<br /><br />Why? The reasons are many.<br /><br />1. First off, the pokemon here are high-level and you can level on them while you search for a Cat here. I recommend raising alternates this way, making one move and then switching.<br /><br />2. This is simply the easiest place to find a Cat. While it's true that the pet battles here are few and far between, you get two additional pets joining the battle rather than just one. I would estimate about a third of your battles will have a Cat. It is quicker than camping spawns at Silvermoon, which I would say is the next-quickest.<br /><br />3. You will be supercalifragilistically happy with the Cat (or Mouse) you get from Netherstorm. I don't want to reveal why, and for the love of Reason don't reply and spoil it. It's not a game balance issue. But you will be very, very VERY <s>happy</s> nostalgic for the days of 5.0.5. Don't buy your Meowth anywhere else.<br /><br />More Info: There is a single spawn point out on Sunstrider Isle (East, North-ish) that has about a three minute respawn time, and produces rares pretty frequently.<br /><br />With the advent of battle-stones, you don't actually need this pokemon at all. It comes in four colours, all of which are obtainable in simple, sad little vendor pets which will be upgradeable to rare and share the same exact moveset:<br />Orange --&gt; <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=7384">Cornish</a><br />Silver --&gt; <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=7381">Silver Tabby</a><br />Black --&gt; <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=7385">Bombay</a> (Side note, why <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=22816">isn't this</a> a pokemon? <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62257">Sand Kitten</a> was deemed good enough.)<br />Siamese --&gt; <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=7380">Siamese</a><br />That said, you <i>can</i> argue that the plain Cat has better possible stat allotments than these cookie-cutter vendor builds (for example, your Siamese Cat will always be exceptionally speedy with no attack to speak of). <br /><br />The sad truth, though, is that if a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=7386">White Kitten</a> can become a rare, the plain Cat will never again be sought after.<br /><br />UPDATE, update, update!<br /><br /><s>Alright, yes, secondary caught pokemon are colour-changers. <b>This will no longer be the case in 5.1!</b> And I quote from the patch notes: &quot;<b>Fixed an issue that would prevent some pets captured in Pet Battles from correctly saving their skin color once added to the Pet Journal.</b>&quot;<br /><br />Capture your colour-changers NOW if you want one before all is lost. It may be that previously captured colour-changers will be reverted to the default colour (siamese for Cat - you can tell by the pokedex picture on any colour-changer you catch; it shows the default). They may not get reverted, though, if what they did with colour-changing Hunter pets is any indication; they allowed us to keep our tamed colour-changers as colour-changers, but caused wild ones to only ever be the skin they were tamed as, here-ever-after.<br /><br />@Widge: Definitely a great name for a colour-changing Cat. (Named my 12/12 Shift, but I might go look for a 13/10 build too) I may have to steal it. The reason I'm so very hopeful that tamed colour-changers will continue to be so is actually two-fold. First, look at the quote. (bolded it) The issue they've fixed seems to be the one to allow you to capture a colour-changer. The ones without saved skin colours but <i>already added to the pet journal</i> might be spared. Secondly, I think it would be pretty difficult to go through <b>everybody's</b> pokedex and <b>give</b> a specific skin to those Cats without one. It especially might make people upset if their beloved pokemon diligently raised to level 25 is suddenly given an ugly skin. They <i>might</i> revert every single one to the default, set a randomiser, or even save the VERY next skin your pokemon appears as its permanent one, but I'm hoping they won't do that.</s><br /><br />Oh well. That was nice while it lasted. All colour-changers now reverted to default skin.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Feathers</b></h3>Confirmed - Cat caught in Arathi Highlands as a secondary battler changes color each time it's summoned.<br /><br />(This is actually extremely annoying to me, and I'm going to see if I can find a rare in the color I want as a primary. Hmphf.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Oddball22</b></h3>Does anyone know if these Cats have a chance of spawning with the Calico cat skin?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1021373</b></h3>I caught one at Silvermoon spawn. Unfortunately, when I first tried to battle, I got the dreaded &quot;battle area is obstructed&quot; message. If you have any sort of fear mechanic, now is the time to use it. You cannot enter battle while the critter is fleeing, but you can catch them on the way back.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ariatanavae</b></h3>If you're hunting a non-secondary rare cat, this worked for me. Sort the realms alphabetically. Create level 1 humans on each realm, run to the cat vendor in the blue house right outside the gates of Northshire. If you take the most direct path, you're unlikely to aggro any higher level mobs. There is usually exactly one battle pet cat there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>desiredusername</b></h3>The cat <i>battles </i>the broom intensely.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Doomstick</b></h3>For those that obtain one of these as their first battle pet, considering they're very easily available early on, these things will become <i>absolutely ludicrously</i> powerful early on if you obtain a Speed/Power breed. Pounce, Screech and Devour. You'll be sweeping through battles for a LONG time (in my experience, that is.) Just take note they do not have a whole lot of HP, so they very much run on 'kill or be killed'; though if you can get Devour off, you're healing pretty much a full third of your health, if not more. Just don't leave it in on an undead pet. You won't heal off those.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MRTF</b></h3>Strange no one has mentioned the fact that this single battle pet, has at least 3 different skins. I happen to have the silver, grey with black stripes and the completely black cat.<br />-However according to screenshots posted here in WoWhead, it seems that there's even a 4th skin; White and orange.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maxmass</b></h3>For those who want to capture this cat high level and rare, you can just head to <a href="/zone=3523/netherstorm">Netherstorm</a> in Outland as almost in 90% of pet battles in there got <a href="/npc=62019/cat">Cat</a> as 2nd or 3rd pet, I could easily farm rare quality of it with the level 19. <br />Edit: I even got 3x rare <a href="/npc=62019/cat">Cat</a> in under than 20 min!</div>
