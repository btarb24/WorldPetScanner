It says it heals you for 100% of the damage dealt, but instead it appears to be calculating the heal you receive [i]before[\/i] taking into account the target's damage reductions or current HP.\n\nFor one thing, it still heals for the full amount even if it's partly overkill. In other words, if your opponent has 20 hp left and you Feed for 400, you get healed for 400, not 20. The same goes for if your Feed hits the damage cap versus a magic-type opponent. You still get the full heal you would have received if the 35% cap hadn't been in effect. During a PvP battle I hit someone's Living Fluid with Prowl+Feed and received a 1217 heal, although the Living Fluid only took 490 damage due to being magic type. This also applies when the opponent is flying type and resistant to beast damage. I hit somebody's moth for 295 (weak) but received a heal for 368.\n\nHowever, you do [i]not[\/i] get any heal if Feed misses, is blocked or dodged, or the target is underground\/flying\/etc. It has to at least hit the target for the heal to go off.\n\nI don't know if all this is intended or an oversight but it's the way it works right now.","date":"2013-10-02T09:18:22-05:00","rating":22,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"I don't find it to be misleading and I definitely think it's intended.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>798023</b></h3>I'll have to level one myself to be sure, but this looks like it will be a pretty potent pet. The naturally high power and low speed is great for prowl since you'll likely be going last anyway and can deliver quite a hit.<br /><br />Moonfire could be useful for dealing with flying pets, but I think I'd much rather take feed over it. Heals 100% damage dealt paired with prowl (and the beast's low health passive) could very well give you some incredible heals while dealing a hefty blow to your enemy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>849042</b></h3>I used Sunreaver Micro-Sentry with &quot;Extra Plating&quot;, then &quot;Call Lighting&quot; and &quot;Fel Immolate&quot; until the Micro-Sentry dies (Laser probably works as well). Besides reduced damage, extra plating also reduces the healamount Xu-Fu gets. The same with Call lighting (weather change).<br /><br />My second pet was Darkmoon Zeppelin. Just use the rocket up to round 7 and make sure that in round 8 you place the Decoy (you need to avoid &quot;Feed&quot; which if everything worked right will turn up in round 9). Afterwards use some other rockets or &quot;Explode&quot; to finish him off.<br /><br />Didn't even need my third pet. Hope it works out for you guys as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>860134</b></h3>While the obvious combo seems to be &gt;Spirit Claws - Moonfire - Prowl&lt; , the <b>Feed+Prowl</b> combo its also very powerful. A Prowling Feed can <b>hit for numbers close to 1k</b>, healing you for the same amount, trampling your oponent down from full Hp while rising you up from certain death to almost full health.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>yakulto</b></h3>This pet is a solid pet you can use for levelling up via pet battles. Makes me concerned if it's too powerful that it will be nerfed soon. <br /><br />You can plow through the wild critter pets at &quot;The Heartland&quot; in the Valley of the Four Winds. 1 successful pet battle with only Xu-Fu doing the bulk of the work (Bite, Bite, Bite, Prowl, Feed, repeat) will yield you average 150k exp. or roughly 1% of exp level bar at lvl. 88.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dramfiolz</b></h3>The tooltip on Feed is a bit misleading. It says it heals you for 100% of the damage dealt, but instead it appears to be calculating the heal you receive <i>before</i> taking into account the target's damage reductions or current HP.<br /><br />For one thing, it still heals for the full amount even if it's partly overkill. In other words, if your opponent has 20 hp left and you Feed for 400, you get healed for 400, not 20. The same goes for if your Feed hits the damage cap versus a magic-type opponent. You still get the full heal you would have received if the 35% cap hadn't been in effect. During a PvP battle I hit someone's Living Fluid with Prowl+Feed and received a 1217 heal, although the Living Fluid only took 490 damage due to being magic type. This also applies when the opponent is flying type and resistant to beast damage. I hit somebody's moth for 295 (weak) but received a heal for 368.<br /><br />However, you do <i>not</i> get any heal if Feed misses, is blocked or dodged, or the target is underground/flying/etc. It has to at least hit the target for the heal to go off.<br /><br />I don't know if all this is intended or an oversight but it's the way it works right now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>805630</b></h3>I just got this pet, and am ticked off because the attacks are not on the same buttons as Xuen. I have to choose between Feed and Moonfire (to back up Spirit Claws) but Xuen has Feed on the third button, allowing both to be used.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>45199</b></h3>Here's a simple way to beat this one.<br /><br />1. Cast <b>Call Lightning</b> with your first pet.<br />2. <i>Switch to a second pet</i> with <b>Exposed Wounds</b> (or similar ability) and cast it.<br />3 Switch to Lil' Bling and cast <b>Make It Rain</b>.<br />4.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>995418</b></h3>Probably of limited value to anyone reading this, but it felt so good that I just have to share it.<br /><br />I enter an all-25 PVP match, the opponent has pets with <a href="/pet-ability=403/sunny-day">Sunny Day</a> and clearly has a strategy revolving around his <a href="/npc=18839/magical-crawdad">Magical Crawdad</a>'s <a href="/pet-ability=273/wish">Wish</a>. Probably one of the most frustrating strategies to fight.<br /><br />I send in my little Xufu. Moonfire. Prowl. My opponent sends in his crawdad at this moment and receives a spirit claw crit of just under 1900, instantly killing his crawdad.<br /><br />Probably one of the most satisfying crits of all my pet battles.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Duskroot</b></h3>Anyone else notice spirit claws misses A LOT with no buff/debuff modifiers?<br />It will happily miss 4 times in a row, more if the poor thing didn't die.<br />The chance of 4x80% hit fails is a row is small. So small (0.16%?) it shouldn't be happening regularly.<br /><br />It got bad enough that I have I started logging unmodified hits and so far the chance of hit is more like 50%. I'll update once I get bored of recording or finish leveling these pets.<br /><br />I only got to 63 before I got bored (Lots of moonlight and darkness so most hits weren't logged)<br />Hit chance climbed a little but only to the low 60s.<br /><br />Also noticed that single misses are very rare. Most misses come in blocks. At one stage I had 7 misses in 10 attempts.</div>

All you have to do if that happens is forfeit the battle and heal up on Yu'la.<br />The 80% hit chance on Spirit Claws can sometimes cause you to have your SMS up longer than anticipated. If that happens, Fel Immolate until it dies and continue from round 5.<br /><br />I hope this helps someone.</div>
