I wasted so much time that Chromie shook her head at me in disgust. I should have just been doing the first half of Loremaster. The second Adventure Mode was unlocked and I could see world quests, I went to where an invasion was (it happened to be Waking Shores - fire) and picked up a stomper. These pets are rare. They don't cluster. But if you just go do the campaign quests until Adventure Mode unlocks, you will see them.<br /><br /><b>If you cannot see world quests (because Adventure Mode unlocks world quests for all your subsequent characters) you will not be able to get this pet.</b><br /><br />I just saved you so much time that I probably singlehandedly saved Chromie's sanity. All ways are the Red Queen's ways, and all time is Chromie's time. Don't waste it!<br /><b>You need the first half of Loremaster, and world quests unloocked</b>. No one else has made this explicit!</div>
