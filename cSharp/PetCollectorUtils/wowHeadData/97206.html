I used a level 120 Blood DK (349) to solo and didn't really have any trouble. Ursoc was the only boss to move my health bar, but he does have a nasty combo of Overwhelm and Rend Flesh that can kill you if you aren't careful, and this may not be an avoidable mechanic when soloing. \n\nThe whelplings are level 25 and spawn in groups of 3, in six or so different packs in the area. You can get multiple rares in each group. My capture team was Bonkers (Kun-Lai Runt or most other humanoids would work), Terrible Turnip, and leveling pet. a P\/P Bonkers two or three shots the whelplings, so switch to your Turnip for the whelpling you actually want to catch. This team will grind through the whelpling packs a bit faster than they respawn, but you won't have to wait more than a minute or so for new packs to appear. \n\nFor cageing, if you don't have a Terrible Turnip, any pet with Weakening Blow (i.e. Snobold Runt) or Superbark (e.g. Scraps) should work -- the important thing is having an attack that won't kill the whelpling. Weakening Blow is ideal for the whelplings since it is a very strong repeatable attack (vs. Superbark which has a 4 round cooldown) and helps cage the whelpling much more quickly. The whelplings tend to heal quite often so you can find yourself in a situation where they repeatedly go from cageable to uncageable which is very frustrating. \n\nEdit: I don't have a Snowbold Runt yet but it is a Humanoid pet, with Weakening Blow and other anti-dragon attacks -- in other words it is THE pet you want for farming this area. You don't need anything else. \n\nEven if you already have all the Dream Whelplings you want this is a great place to grind pet battles to level pets or your character. In fact, I don't know of any other place where you can find such an easy group of level 25's to beat using only a single pet.

I've noticed there sometimes seems to be a bug related to classes with pets (beast mastery hunter, frost mage, warlock, etc.). If you are playing on a class with a pet and you are getting a &quot;failed to create pet battle&quot; error message when engaging the whelplings - try dismissing your pet before beginning the pet battle.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ElsaFC</b></h3>After an LFR run of Xavius, everyone left the raid and I was in search of a rare dream whelpling. Got a rare P/P pretty quick then just kept pet battling searching for a P/S. They keep respawning so you could be in there all day if you felt like it. Good luck!<br /><br />I swept them under the rug with my enchanted broom (Broom) or Hogs (Vicious Slice) and my leveling pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Astrowla</b></h3><s>I have fought a TON of these in LFR (leveling pets because its a safe place) and I have yet to see a blue one of them. Can anyone confirm there are no blues?</s><br /><br />I have been battling these things for hours after LFR and I can tell you for one - I am not sure, but no bet treats or bonus' can be used to gain extra exp from them (I noticed that I was getting the same amount of exp after the buff wore off.) perhaps because it was in a 'raid'... <br /><br />I did finally find blues. Many, actually. I have three of them now and I am very pleased.<br /><br />I highly suggest using this area to level your pets (If you like leveling them slowly). Just a quick LFR Xavius kill and you have the place to yourself basically. They have a fast respawn rate, they are all lvl 25, they almost never do damage (they mostly heal themselves) and it's a safe place where you wont be interrupted by players or npcs.<br /><br />Just take two leveling pets and an Anubisath Idol and you are set.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gaffa</b></h3>If you're looking for true easy mode on this fight use <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63621">Feral Vermling</a> (1/2/2) Just use <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=668">Dreadful Breath</a> it will destroy all opposing whelps. Takes out the back row first while the one up front battling will heal a bit so you can simply capture it. Don't think I even bothered to heal my pets through 5 seperate combats.<br /><br />Bring a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63365">Terrible Turnip</a> or <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=84915">Molten Corgi</a> as backup if you're worried about killing your capture target.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lapdragon</b></h3>These guys seem to give an awful lot of XP (I was wearing my safari hat at the time, but still) - normal battles generally give ~500 XP per leveling pet, and these guys are giving ~1200 apiece for two pets, or ~2800 for a single leveling pet.<br /><br />I used a Moonshell Crab (P/S, 1-1-1) as my &quot;backbone pet&quot; for carrying the other two, and if one of your pets is low level, bring it in as soon as one of the whelps puts itself to sleep (which can happen on the first turn, so watch for the ZZZ's). Keep <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=310">Shell Shield</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=511">Renewing Mists</a> up full time, and the crab will likely stay pretty much topped up the whole time - the non-rare versions of the whelps don't hit usually very hard (they'll get an occasional 500 point hit in, but it's rare), so you can skip the Renewing Mists if you're on a roll and want to finish off a whelp.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rvnender</b></h3>Manged to catch the rare version of this. I figured I would level him using the dalaran pet battle. Damn thing soloed every one. Now its lvl 25. <br /><br />Powerful little creature this thing is.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ak404</b></h3>I'm not sure if anyone's mentioned it yet, but if you like using the 2,2,2 configuration of the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=68850">Emerald Proto-Whelp</a>, these little guys are a lot easier to find.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>7omRavenclaw</b></h3>I usually found the rare ones near the &quot;spirit&quot; of Ursoc, in the back of the map.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Phelgrahm</b></h3>To get to the area where the whelps spawn you need to defeat Xavius, the final boss of the Emerald Nightmare raid, but you can do this on the 10 man normal setting. I used a level 120 Blood DK (349) to solo and didn't really have any trouble. Ursoc was the only boss to move my health bar, but he does have a nasty combo of Overwhelm and Rend Flesh that can kill you if you aren't careful, and this may not be an avoidable mechanic when soloing. <br /><br />The whelplings are level 25 and spawn in groups of 3, in six or so different packs in the area. You can get multiple rares in each group. My capture team was Bonkers (Kun-Lai Runt or most other humanoids would work), Terrible Turnip, and leveling pet. a P/P Bonkers two or three shots the whelplings, so switch to your Turnip for the whelpling you actually want to catch. This team will grind through the whelpling packs a bit faster than they respawn, but you won't have to wait more than a minute or so for new packs to appear. <br /><br />For cageing, if you don't have a Terrible Turnip, any pet with Weakening Blow (i.e. Snobold Runt) or Superbark (e.g. Scraps) should work -- the important thing is having an attack that won't kill the whelpling. Weakening Blow is ideal for the whelplings since it is a very strong repeatable attack (vs. Superbark which has a 4 round cooldown) and helps cage the whelpling much more quickly. The whelplings tend to heal quite often so you can find yourself in a situation where they repeatedly go from cageable to uncageable which is very frustrating. <br /><br />Edit: I don't have a Snowbold Runt yet but it is a Humanoid pet, with Weakening Blow and other anti-dragon attacks -- in other words it is THE pet you want for farming this area. You don't need anything else. <br /><br />Even if you already have all the Dream Whelplings you want this is a great place to grind pet battles to level pets or your character. In fact, I don't know of any other place where you can find such an easy group of level 25's to beat using only a single pet. The whelplings do hardly any damage so all you need is a humanoid pet (which has moderate self-heal racial) that has a decent, repeatable damage attack versus dragons, such as Bonkers, Kun Lai Runt, etc.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Slania</b></h3>A level 25 Harbinger of Flame is a good choice to farm through packs you don't want (he does 289-434 Jab damage vs Dragonkin) or Pandaren Monk, which I levelled up solely via these whelplings as a carry but he was able to solo all 3 in each fight by level 15 with 1,1,1 abilities (389-584 strong Jab, 695 Fury of 1,000 Fists due to bonus Humanoid vs Dragonkin). Great for Flawless Dragonkin Battle-Stones too, got 2 while trying to get P/B and P/S blue whelplings after getting a P/P blue on my first battle.<br /><br />I can level any pet from level 1 since I can track pet ability cooldowns and throw one in at an opportune moment.
