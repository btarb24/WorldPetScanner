Its Humanoid trait makes soaking damage much easier without a dedicated heal and [petability=312] is identical to Deflect for negating big hits and baiting status effects. He's got two different 2-hit attacks, [petability=158] for faster enemies, [petability=535] for slower ones. And I don't even need to talk about [petability=362] as an invaluable utility for bursting down walls. He's got great synergy with the ever popular [npc=40624], who can set him up with Moonfire and Ancient Blessing to mitigate his rather lean health pool and enable him to tear through enemies like a runaway train. \r\n\r\nThis guy can seriously rip the heads off dragons like nobody's business, and I've found that to be [i]extremely [\/i]useful against a lot players who spam over powered Dragonkin in PvP. I've also been able to comfortably substitute him in for many [npc=68659] strategy in PvE. I believe he completely eclipses [npc=62555] as a viable substitute for Anubis in every way. While he's not as tanky, it hardly matters when he's able to blast through a lot of pesky tamers' worst pets in half as many rounds. \r\n\r\nI currently use a P\/P one with Howl boosted Counterstrike for a massive 2-hits in one that punch through anything that doesn't resist Humanoid like a canon. I used an S\/S one with Counterstrike and Pounce for a while, but found that it out sped too many things for Counterstrike to be a reliable 2-hit attack, and while Pounce is great in its own right there are other pets who synergize more, so the slot is better dedicated to Howl. But that's just my opinion! I really recommend getting one and trying him out for yourself. It's become one of my 'go-to' pets for almost any situation.\r\n\r\n[small][i]Feel free to disagree, though I'd rather hear other thoughts on the matter than a simple downvote. I tried to make this comment informative about the pet and it's uses, rather than just regurgitating drop-rate info, so I appreciate feed back.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sidhebane</b></h3>Question:<br />The P/P breed would use the setup Counterstrike (To take advantage of being slow) Mangle (because Dodge is less useful when you're slow) and Howl (because Pounce is, again, less useful if you're slow)<br /><br />This allows for REALLY HARD Counterstrikes. But... Counterstrike, being the ONLY damaging move in that setup, has a 2-turn cooldown? WHY? Tail Sweep (Which is actually more useful, since you only have to be slower, not actually take damage to activate its extra attack, so it still double-hits if the opponent buffs/shields/heals) has no cooldown. Pounce, which double-hits if you're FASTER, has no cooldown. So why the massive CD on Counterstrike?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1533088</b></h3>I want to put my 2 cents in here that this pet is <u><b>criminally</b></u> underrated in both PvE and especially PvP. Its Humanoid trait makes soaking damage much easier without a dedicated heal and <a href="/pet-ability=312/dodge">Dodge</a> is identical to Deflect for negating big hits and baiting status effects. He's got two different 2-hit attacks, <a href="/pet-ability=158/counterstrike">Counterstrike</a> for faster enemies, <a href="/pet-ability=535/pounce">Pounce</a> for slower ones. And I don't even need to talk about <a href="/pet-ability=362/howl">Howl</a> as an invaluable utility for bursting down walls. He's got great synergy with the ever popular <a href="/npc=40624/celestial-dragon">Celestial Dragon</a>, who can set him up with Moonfire and Ancient Blessing to mitigate his rather lean health pool and enable him to tear through enemies like a runaway train. <br /><br />This guy can seriously rip the heads off dragons like nobody's business, and I've found that to be <i>extremely </i>useful against a lot players who spam over powered Dragonkin in PvP. I've also been able to comfortably substitute him in for many <a href="/npc=68659/anubisath-idol">Anubisath Idol</a> strategy in PvE. I believe he completely eclipses <a href="/npc=62555/flayer-youngling">Flayer Youngling</a> as a viable substitute for Anubis in every way. While he's not as tanky, it hardly matters when he's able to blast through a lot of pesky tamers' worst pets in half as many rounds. <br /><br />I currently use a P/P one with Howl boosted Counterstrike for a massive 2-hits in one that punch through anything that doesn't resist Humanoid like a canon. I used an S/S one with Counterstrike and Pounce for a while, but found that it out sped too many things for Counterstrike to be a reliable 2-hit attack, and while Pounce is great in its own right there are other pets who synergize more, so the slot is better dedicated to Howl. But that's just my opinion! I really recommend getting one and trying him out for yourself. It's become one of my 'go-to' pets for almost any situation.<br /><br /><i>Feel free to disagree, though I'd rather hear other thoughts on the matter than a simple downvote. I tried to make this comment informative about the pet and it's uses, rather than just regurgitating drop-rate info, so I appreciate feed back. </i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Healsbilly</b></h3>If this is all you need... Originally by <b>JonGhost52 </b>: Quick way to this. Just at the dungeon entrance, take the stairs behind the friendly NPC Berthold the Doorman, go to the Banquet Hall and kill Moroes. Go back towards the dungeon entrance and take the very first passage, next to the friendly NPC Hastings the Caretaker. Progress through the corridor at the top-left, you'll reach The Guest Chambers, turn immediately to the right into the Banquet Hall, and keep goingtowards then round the Opera stage taking the right branch around ; you will arrive below, then behind the Opera stage, speak to the friendly NPC named Barnes The Stage Manager and tell him you are not an actor (this dialogue option is not available if you haven't kill Moroes, instead Barnes tells you something about no shows because of the Moroes situation). He will open the door to the stage and introduce the spectacle ; it is random between several so you may not get the Grandmother each time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aloasa</b></h3>This took so much time for me to legit get without trade or AH.. not because of bad drops but because the damn Riding Hood opera event didn't came up... until last week when I saw it happened on Sunday, so I tried it again today, and not only did I got that event again, but I also got the pet... and considering every tuesday I seemed to get Oz and Thursdays seem to get R&amp;J... I think is RNG as in the stages are one per day of the week or idk.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sodal</b></h3>Started out with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/user=Healsbilly">Healsbilly</a>'s <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=71014/lil-bad-wolf#comments:id=2455778">comment</a> but found some parts which could use some improvement.<br /><br />(For the Lil' Bad Wolf farm, you first have to kill <a href="/npc=15687/moroes">Moroes</a>, if you don't do that and directly go to talk to <a href="/npc=16812/barnes">Barnes</a> you'll get <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=16812/barnes#comments:id=768046">this message</a> saying Moroes doesn't allow it. Might be necessary to place the cursor in the URL area and hit enter to jump to the right comment.)<br /><br />Once you're inside the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/karazhan">Karazhan</a> instance and have passed through the <i>Gatehouse Door</i> into <i>The Gatehouse</i>, you'll see <a href="/npc=16153/berthold">Berthold</a> straight in front of you. Follow the sets of stairs behind him up into <i>The Grand Ballroom</i> and turn left into <i>The Banquet Hall</i> where <a href="/npc=15687/moroes">Moroes</a> is standing on a slightly raised platform (with some cronies around him).<br /><br />After killing <a href="/npc=15687/moroes">Moroes</a>, go back down to <a href="/npc=16153/berthold">Berthold</a> and turn left, follow the wall and turn through the doorway on your left. You should see <a href="/npc=16169/hastings">Hastings</a> on your right at this point. Continue following the wall to your left, through the rooms filled with <a href="/npc=16171/coldmist-widow">Coldmist Widow</a> spiders. Once you reach the room with <a href="/npc=16173/shadowbat">Shadowbat</a>s and <a href="/npc=16175/vampiric-shadowbat">Vampiric Shadowbat</a>s, turn left again into a small corridor with two 90Â° turns, leading up to <i>The Guest Chambers</i>. Take a right turn into <i>The Banquet Hall</i> and make another right turn. Go straight ahead, passing through the <a href="/npc=16471/skeletal-usher">Skeletal Usher</a>s, into <i>The Opera Hall</i> and walk into the lowered area below the stage. Follow on through the doorway on the left, turn right and walk behind the stage. Once you can turn right again, you'll see <a href="/npc=16812/barnes">Barnes</a> and you can start <i>The Opera Event</i>, hoping it'll be <i>Red Riding Hood</i> out of the three possibilities. And if it's the right event, hope that <a href="/item=97548/spiky-collar">Spiky Collar</a> drops.</div>
