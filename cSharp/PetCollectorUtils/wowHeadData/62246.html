I worked my way from the northeast clearing most of the pets I found (battling the lvl 5s while killing the lvl 3\/4s) I did see quite a few snails but none of them were rare.\nIt took quite a while but eventually I made my way to the bottom of the zone, so I took another sweep across the beach. While I managed to get my rare on my 2nd snail, I continued to fly through the beach and it is now crawling with tamable snails I counted and there were at least 15 of them in total. Some of them even spawned in spots that I was sure a critter version was previously at.\n\nThis make me wonder, what if some of the zone unique pets spawn in different conditions?\n1. They can spawn regularly independent of the other wild pets in the zone. However this spawn is usually very slow, varying from few min to an hour or more (something like the minferal), and there may also be a cap on how many can be up or a DR on the time between spawns when the number up gets high enough . This would explain the few regular spawns of pets when there were no one clearing wild pets in the zone, be it for this or the tiny twisters, or even the cloud serpent hatchlings, I have seen this behavior all over the place.\n2. They can also spawn when the other wild pets are killed, freeing up a spot of the number of wild pets within the zone. That would explain why I get to see dozens of spawn when I finished clearing the place.\n3. Or maybe they could just mass-spawn very rarely regardless of any other conditions, and I was lucky to be there when it happened. (As illustrated by the scourged whelplings mass-spawning every 24 hrs)\n4. Many people have claimed that killing unfightable critters helps spawning more wild pets,  but after seeing that tamable versions could spawn even when a critter version is present on the same spot I am doubtful on this theory.\nBasically, all of the conditions work closely together, that's why there have been varying reports on how to farm certain rarer pets. Of course there could be others that aren't mentioned here.\n\nEither way I'll just keep that in mind when farming other rares, good luck to all fellow campers.","date":"2012-11-25T20:25:37-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"I personally think some just mass spawn for no reason (probably rng time based).

Scooter is only an H\/H, but the Shimmershell Snail also has an H\/H breed, and these two have identical stats. So the baseline snails on which the breeds are built are all the same. All five have identical attacks. So only the breeds distinguish the battle value of the fully trained snails.\n\nIt has also been pointed out that the snails are slow, and that even the S\/S lags other battle pets, so speed is a throw-away stat.\n\nSince you have no choice with Scooter, you get an H\/H, avoiding the throw-away stat. The downside of Scooter is he starts as a level 1 uncommon. All of the rest can be caught as a rare.\n\nThe Shimmershell Snail is available as an H\/H, an H\/P, and a B\/B. Avoiding B\/B because of low numbers, some wasted on speed, the H\/H is attractive, but you already have that covered with Scooter. The H\/P is unique among the snails, so is probably the better choice. These also start at a low level; 5 or 6 is typical.\n\nBy the criteria of avoiding speed, getting breeds that spend points elsewhere, those are the two best snails. None of the rest have a breed that avoids speed.\n\nConsider next the Rusty Snail, available as an H\/S, an H\/B, and a B\/B. The H\/B has all the health of the H\/S, and nearly as much attack power as the B\/B; so the H\/B is probably the best choice for this snail. It also starts out fairly low, but a bit higher than the Shimmershell Snail.\n\nThe last two snails have the advantage of being higher level when you catch them, close to max. There is a good chance these will be the first snails you get to level 25.\n\nThe Rapana Whelk is available as an S\/S, an H\/B, and a B\/B. Per the choice for Rusty Snail breed, among these last two snails, the H\/B is the strongest.\n\nThe Silkbead Snail is only available as an H\/S and a B\/B. Ignoring the speed, the health & health vs health & attack power is close. I'd favor the B\/B, but not greatly so.\n\nOne final thought, if you level your breed of choice of each of these to max level, \n\nLevel 25 Rare Scooter the Snail H\/H\nLevel 25 Rare Shimmershell Snail H\/P\nLevel 25 Rare Rusty Snail H\/B\nLevel 25 Rare Rapana Whelk H\/B\nLevel 25 Rare Silkbead Snail B\/B\n\nthe H\/B Rapana Welk no longer stands out; you have two better and one equivalent snail. At that point, it is fairly useless, so I'd consider replacing the Rapana Whelk with the S\/S breed, as the fastest snail. \n\nLevel 25 Rare Scooter the Snail H\/H\nLevel 25 Rare Shimmershell Snail H\/P\nLevel 25 Rare Rusty Snail H\/B\nLevel 25 Rare Rapana Whelk S\/S\nLevel 25 Rare Silkbead Snail B\/B\n\nYes, the fastest snail is still slow, but it does stand out from the herd, and there might be a situation where it proves useful.","date":"2015-12-05T02:37:28-06:00","rating":17,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2015-12-05T14:15:31-06:00",2,"Scoobydeux"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":18,"id":2294463,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"bomaya","body":"Think spawn rates and levels must have been increased.

Its Absorb ability combined with the huge amount of healt makes it quite impossible to be killed, even in pvp battles.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ercanrua</b></h3>Are these bad boys only around in the daytime? I've just made two passes of the entire shoreline and only come across one as an add when battling a Darkshore Cub. Not one out on it's own...<br /><br />Which reminds me, what's the definition of daytime vs nighttime, anyway?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>weibe23</b></h3>yes they are all along the coast of darkshore, and you will see them, however they are only flagged with the pet battle symbol in southern part</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>pmakaro</b></h3>Do not be fooled by all the dots on the map. This pet is very difficult to even find let alone finding a rare (blue) quality.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>verduran</b></h3>Finally got my rare after about 2 hours of farming.<br />My first sweep across the zone was brief as I was just trying to catch every pet, I flew across the shoreline and found about 6-7 of them (and none of them is rare).<br />Today I started going after a rare, my first sweep also yielded around 6 of them, I then started clearing the critter versions but the spawn rates of the tamable ones remains quite low (about 2-3 every clear).<br />After that I read the comments here and started going after lvl 5 pets. I worked my way from the northeast clearing most of the pets I found (battling the lvl 5s while killing the lvl 3/4s) I did see quite a few snails but none of them were rare.<br />It took quite a while but eventually I made my way to the bottom of the zone, so I took another sweep across the beach. While I managed to get my rare on my 2nd snail, I continued to fly through the beach and it is now crawling with tamable snails I counted and there were at least 15 of them in total. Some of them even spawned in spots that I was sure a critter version was previously at.<br /><br />This make me wonder, what if some of the zone unique pets spawn in different conditions?<br />1. They can spawn regularly independent of the other wild pets in the zone. However this spawn is usually very slow, varying from few min to an hour or more (something like the minferal), and there may also be a cap on how many can be up or a DR on the time between spawns when the number up gets high enough . This would explain the few regular spawns of pets when there were no one clearing wild pets in the zone, be it for this or the tiny twisters, or even the cloud serpent hatchlings, I have seen this behavior all over the place.<br />2. They can also spawn when the other wild pets are killed, freeing up a spot of the number of wild pets within the zone. That would explain why I get to see dozens of spawn when I finished clearing the place.<br />3. Or maybe they could just mass-spawn very rarely regardless of any other conditions, and I was lucky to be there when it happened. (As illustrated by the scourged whelplings mass-spawning every 24 hrs)<br />4. Many people have claimed that killing unfightable critters helps spawning more wild pets, but after seeing that tamable versions could spawn even when a critter version is present on the same spot I am doubtful on this theory.<br />Basically, all of the conditions work closely together, that's why there have been varying reports on how to farm certain rarer pets. Of course there could be others that aren't mentioned here.<br /><br />Either way I'll just keep that in mind when farming other rares, good luck to all fellow campers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vindictae</b></h3>I spent ages clearing and got nowhere.<br />Out of frustration I tagged a lvl 5 squirrel and decided to level a pet...hey presto. Secondary was a lvl 5 rare Shimmershell Snail.<br />Battle the pets on the edges of the beach. You might just get lucky. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>983652</b></h3>I don't know if they have upped the spawn rate, but when I went there today to catch one I found quite a lot. I did however use the &quot;trick&quot; of killing the non-battle critters along the beach, try this if you're having a hard time finding the ones you can battle.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>adashiel</b></h3>Though its high-health <a href="http://www.warcraftpets.com/wow-pet-battles/breeds/">breed</a> has the largest health pool of any player battle pet, don't overlook the H/P (breed 7) version. Because snail base stats are already weighted toward health, this power-health hybrid has more health than many pure health breed pets, and it has more attack power than any other snail. If you'd still like a maximum health snail, you can either opt for a second shimmershell with the H/H breed or you can use <a href="/npc=51635/scooter-the-snail">Scooter the Snail</a>, which is always H/H and has identical stats. You will need a flawless battle stone to upgrade Scooter to Rare, however.(##RESPBREAK##)2056##DELIM##adashiel##DELIM##</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>adam612</b></h3>Seems to be three different colors that you can catch.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Darkchyylde</b></h3>Following the tips in the comments here I started farming any pets I could over lvl 5. A few battles in I hit a Darkshore Cub, and lo and behold, the secondary pet was a rare Shimmershell :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ilostmahbucket</b></h3>Say that five times fast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lichee</b></h3>Not sure it was mentioned yet but it is indeed possible to find a rare under level 5. You shouldnt skip any you come across. Like others mentioned, I would also battle cubs or other pets that spawn in between the forest and beach that are atleast level 5 in case you get a snail as a secondary pet to the battle.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Scoobydeux</b></h3>It has been pointed out that there are currently five snail battle pets,<br /><br /><a href="/npc=51635/scooter-the-snail">Scooter the Snail</a><br /><a href="/npc=62246/shimmershell-snail">Shimmershell Snail</a><br /><a href="/npc=62313/rusty-snail">Rusty Snail</a><br /><a href="/npc=64352/rapana-whelk">Rapana Whelk</a><br /><a href="/npc=63001/silkbead-snail">Silkbead Snail</a><br /><br />Four of these have a B/B breed, and these have identical stats. Scooter is only an H/H, but the Shimmershell Snail also has an H/H breed, and these two have identical stats. So the baseline snails on which the breeds are built are all the same. All five have identical attacks. So only the breeds distinguish the battle value of the fully trained snails.<br /><br />It has also been pointed out that the snails are slow, and that even the S/S lags other battle pets, so speed is a throw-away stat.<br /><br />Since you have no choice with Scooter, you get an H/H, avoiding the throw-away stat. The downside of Scooter is he starts as a level 1 uncommon. All of the rest can be caught as a rare.<br /><br />The Shimmershell Snail is available as an H/H, an H/P, and a B/B. Avoiding B/B because of low numbers, some wasted on speed, the H/H is attractive, but you already have that covered with Scooter. The H/P is unique among the snails, so is probably the better choice. These also start at a low level; 5 or 6 is typical.<br /><br />By the criteria of avoiding speed, getting breeds that spend points elsewhere, those are the two best snails. None of the rest have a breed that avoids speed.<br /><br />Consider next the Rusty Snail, available as an H/S, an H/B, and a B/B. The H/B has all the health of the H/S, and nearly as much attack power as the B/B; so the H/B is probably the best choice for this snail. It also starts out fairly low, but a bit higher than the Shimmershell Snail.<br /><br />The last two snails have the advantage of being higher level when you catch them, close to max. There is a good chance these will be the first snails you get to level 25.<br /><br />The Rapana Whelk is available as an S/S, an H/B, and a B/B. Per the choice for Rusty Snail breed, among these last two snails, the H/B is the strongest.<br /><br />The Silkbead Snail is only available as an H/S and a B/B. Ignoring the speed, the health &amp; health vs health &amp; attack power is close. I'd favor the B/B, but not greatly so.<br /><br />One final thought, if you level your breed of choice of each of these to max level, <br /><br />Level 25 Rare Scooter the Snail H/H<br />Level 25 Rare Shimmershell Snail H/P<br />Level 25 Rare Rusty Snail H/B<br />Level 25 Rare Rapana Whelk H/B<br />Level 25 Rare Silkbead Snail B/B<br /><br />the H/B Rapana Welk no longer stands out; you have two better and one equivalent snail. At that point, it is fairly useless, so I'd consider replacing the Rapana Whelk with the S/S breed, as the fastest snail. <br /><br />Level 25 Rare Scooter the Snail H/H<br />Level 25 Rare Shimmershell Snail H/P<br />Level 25 Rare Rusty Snail H/B<br />Level 25 Rare Rapana Whelk S/S<br />Level 25 Rare Silkbead Snail B/B<br /><br />Yes, the fastest snail is still slow, but it does stand out from the herd, and there might be a situation where it proves useful.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bomaya</b></h3>Think spawn rates and levels must have been increased. Landed in Lor'Danel - found one instantly - uncommon. Found second straight after which was a green with a rare as a secondary. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DrummerKane</b></h3>You need to go to the past.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>grouchomarx</b></h3>This is probably obvious, but it took me 15 minutes to figure out this is in the &quot;old&quot; Darkshore phase, pre-BFA that is. You will need to talk to Zidormi in the very north section to change Darkshore to the old version, then you will find them quite easily on the shore. Make sure you have a level 5ish team, at least for the first 2 pets or you will completely obliterate the Shimmershell Snail pet with one ability.</div>
