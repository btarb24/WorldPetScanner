<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>taurenmoo812</b></h3>This is a lore rant. <br /><br />Something that annoys me so much about this, is just how much this here gives me reason to hate on blizzard for what they are doing with BFA.<br />So I found the pet on my orc shaman, and after finding out what I needed to do for the proceeding 'quests' with Uuna, he went though all this, even going to alliance towns that guards spawned and attacked me to get it done. That didn't bother me, its clear they made this more for alliance players, but as an horde players I did this regardless.<br />My orc shaman went into the shadowlands to find her and rescue her, he brought her all over azeroth and draenor, and in the end i like to imagine her and him being friends every time he gives her a hug.<br /><br />The expansion following this is about the horde blindly following a tyrannical warchief into burning down teldrassil and possibly killing many, many innocent people. <br /><br />This is what I hate about blizzard, I was able to go into the shadowlands to save a draenei child from a fate worse then death, be a hero, but the writers want me to forget all that and become a faction pawn once again after everything in legion and all the good we did. When you go from saving innocent souls from the legion regardless of their faction or race, to now following a tyrant killing innocent people, how am I meant to overlook that, it makes my character into a sociopath.<br /><br />Rant over, just consider this fact when your doing this quest as horde.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>saillaw</b></h3>I wish Blizzard would add to the quest-line so we could get a mount for Uuna. I feel guilty, a bit like a slave driver, watching her run behind me as I ride comfortably on my mount. A cute house-cat or bunny rabbit mount perhaps? Or maybe a puppy? Although it should be able to fly too... so maybe a baby sloth with wings or a baby owl? Or maybe something dark and sinister... she is a ghost after all.</div>

As she is talking about the 'flying city' she asks if I live there and then asks &quot;Do you live ANYwhere?&quot;. I'm a night elf. The feels.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Meowsers</b></h3>Something to note if you're running around trying to do the World Tour with Uuna. I'm not sure when it happened, but I went to the Mount Hyjal location and couldn't get her to trigger. When you go to Hyjal nowadays, as a 120, there's 120 azerite creatures there. <br />I watched videos, looked at screen shots of maps, location, etc. I had relogged, flew out of area and back, portaled out of the area and came back, I even opened a ticket because I couldn't get it work. <br /><br />I saw a comment somewhere saying the spot is right next to a druid who wasn't there. I forgot his name. So I logged onto a different character, a level 93 whom I haven't touched in forever. Went to Hyjal and the druid was there. I summoned Uuna where the maps showed and she ran right over and began talking. <br /><br />So if you're having problems, I would suggest doing this!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>m4DD0gg</b></h3>So obtaining this pet is currently bugged unless you can get in a group with someone with a completed Unna pet.<br /><br />The bug is in the 'World Tour' you have to do with Unna which involves taking Unna to various places around Azeroth. One of which is Gate of the Setting sun in Vale of Eternal Blossoms.<br /><br />The 8.3 content is causing the bug as Unna wont RP with the gate regardless of if you reverse time to before the invasions.<br /><br />Cant see Blizz fixing this any time soon........<br /><br />Imagine doing all that hard work for it to be bugged at the last section.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Paulnutz</b></h3>I've managed to get the Vale portion of the quest to proceed by using a 120 character that has not started the legendary cloak questline and thus has never phased Vale into the 8.3 vale.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>polgaranzsaufang</b></h3><b>Getting to Exodar/Bloodmyst Isle as HORDE in 2020!</b><br /><br />I found this very frustrating because so many guides are out of date or patch 8.01 etc and don't have the right information. <br /><br />There is a mage called <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=141489/zidormi">Zidormi </a>in <b>Darkshore </b>- she has a counterpart in the Vale that does the same thing - when you look at the map there is a speech bubble marking her position (<b>48,24</b>). She can teleport you <b>BACK in TIME</b> so that everything is as it was before and you can go over to <b>Ruttheran Village</b>, there isn't much fatigue. Remember there is a Darkshore portal down at the docks in Zuldazar.<br /><br />At the 3rd pier to the left, there is an NPC called <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=141903/eranril-moontear">Eranril Moontear</a> beside a portal. He won't aggro to you and you can use the portal to get to Exodar and then I just walked over to Bloodmyst Isle for the Uuna portion of this quest.

OMG I think we have all been in the wrong spot. When you go to where the instance is everyone I see stands right in the front of the huge gate, just inside the gate in front of the NPCS. But this is the WRONG location, you have to go around the side and you will see a courtyard with a large fountain in the middle and 2 NPCs in front of that entrance....that is the one you want and the one that triggers her Princess speech :) Good luck! Onward with Uuna!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LadySawen</b></h3>If you are stuck at Uuna world tour and she doesn't trigger the dialogue, try the following it worked for me:<br /><br /><ul><li>Disable your add-ons, all of them</li><li>Go see Zidormi, she is in the palace and asks her to let you see the vale before the invasion</li><li>Summon Unna and go back to the gate, dismount before entering through the gates so that she can follow you</li></ul><br /><br />Right after that, she will speak to you, it worked immediately for me.<br />I suspect this bug is related to the invasion within that zone.<br /><br />Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Amago</b></h3>Hi, I'm trying to get Uuna improved, in the step of going to get his nuu doll, I don't see him in the place he should be. someone could help me? Greetings and thank you</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lossibob</b></h3>The Gate of the Setting Sun and Nighthold visits need to be done during night - tried both of them so many times, but as soon as I did them during night hours (midnight-6am for WoW), it worked straight away - I completed the whole &quot;World Tour&quot; in around 30 mins, after hours of trying unsuccessfully to get a response at the Gate. <br />I saw a single comment somewhere about the gate and it suddenly dawned on me that the clues had been there throughout her storyline. Normal light was &quot;too bright&quot; for her to see - she needed the moonlight in Ashenvale to see clearly, the Gate of the SETTING Sun (Not Rising Sun), NIGHThold .... etc etc etc. Like I said, all worked smoothly for me. Hope it does for you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SargerasWasRight</b></h3>I would travel to all ends of the world for this girl. In fact, I have.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rothar</b></h3>When doing the world tour portion I used this macro (from the guide) helped tremendously, especially since Uuna never said her bit on stop #3 in Dalaran but this showed me that it was done:<br /><br />/run local a={50140,50141,50142,50143,50144,50145,50146,50147}for i,q in ipairs(a)do print(format(&quot;Uuna World Tour %s: %s&quot;,i, C_QuestLog.IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(q) and &quot;\124cFF00FF00Done\124r&quot; or &quot;\124cFFFF0000Not Done\124r&quot;)) end</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>violetta</b></h3>well so much for Uuna having anything in Shadowlands</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Scarecrow59</b></h3>Absolutely loved the storyline, wish they made more side stories like this</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Belladon</b></h3>If anyone is struggling with the last step when taking Uuna on a world tour, specifically the first location in Vale of Eternal Blossoms. <br />This waypoint triggered the dialogue for me: /way Vale of Eternal Blossoms:Pandaria 8.48 58.64</div>
