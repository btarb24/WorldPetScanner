I would suggest you level with this pet, it's a fun one and one of the few lower level elemntals.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>821797</b></h3>I found my rare quality Ruby Sapling with a health bar of 135 @ challenge (in other words, not it's health *after* taming). I know some of you hate wasting time searching for the rares ... so here's what I ran into...<br />I challenged 8 Saplings ranging in health from 117 - 135, with 135 being the rare I found.<br /><br />Happy Hunting =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>945883</b></h3>Yeah I am in the process of finding a rare now....Gotta say this is the longest i've searched for a rare pet. It's been over an hour</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AzureShadow42</b></h3>This pet has three different seeds, one having high health, one having high speed, and one having high power. This pet is notable among all the rest because it is one of the few whose seed can not only be easily determined by its level 1 stats, but also has level 1 stat distributions that match up with its level 25 stat distributions.<br /><br />If you're trying to catch a rare Ruby Sapling, the high HP seed will have 135 health while you are fighting it, and the other two seeds will have 127 health. If the health value isn't one of those two exact values, it is almost certainly an uncommon or lower.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Taiine</b></h3>After gaining a rare on my first catch I am very glad I have chosen to keep leveling this one and not just add it to my over all collection. Mine is a 'high health' rare as poster before stated of the three kinds. <br /><br />If you want a nice pet that can aid you in gaining other pets then this is it. It's self heal Photosynthesis makes it a hard pet to down even against those strong against it's type (though it still will take more damage, it will stay up longer). <br /><br />Thanks to this pet, I can send it out to sit there and self heal while I spam trap on a pet I want. It has led me to many more rares where otherwise I could (and have) lost my whole team. Lucky Ruby as I call mine will remain on my 'pet collecting' team.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jxnboy007</b></h3>Caught this Ruby Sapling at 2:20am Eastern U.S. Eversong Woods (54,58); out of 2 kills, 1 was rare. He is only a level 1, so equip your pets accordingly. Can not be caged. Good Luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1050987</b></h3>Well i farmed for a rare one of these for what seemed like forever so i got alot of info:<br /><br />rare = 135 hp <br /> its stats when you cap it are<br /> hp = 162<br /> power = 11<br /> speed = 10<br /><br />uncommon = 125 hp <br /> stats when you cap it<br /> hp = 150<br /> power = 10<br /> speed = 11<br /><br />uncommon = 131 hp<br /> stats when you cap it<br /> hp = 158 ( I believe released and forgot)<br /> power = 10<br /> speed = 10<br /><br />Someone mentioned a 129 I think but I never saw one. Everything else is crap. Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jinxx532</b></h3>I am beginning to think they do not exist damnit... I have been looking for one now for well over 5 hours</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1058762</b></h3>got my rare pet today (yay!) at 129 hp. so the rumor that he has to have more than 136 hp is NOT true<br />just saying :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rockeye574</b></h3>Hmmm, I must note that even though under the Photosynthesis ability's tooltip it says it is twice as effective in sunny weather, it however is not because Elementals are immune to weather effects. I really wish this were fixed (I like using my Terrible Turnip on my pet collecting team) and the two of them together would be that much better)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>antioch</b></h3>Despite its ubiquity in Eversong Woods, finding a rare of this pet is a real exercise in frustration.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LiriellGarrosh</b></h3>For some reason, the one I just captured has 155 health, 11 power, and 12 speed. It shows as being rare quality. I wonder why it doesn't match up with what other people have posted.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>226817</b></h3>One of the best tanking pets, be sure to get breed Id 6 (high HP). At lvl 25 its HP is lower by 160 than THE tanking pet - Strand Crawler (or Strand Crab breed ID 6), but has a bit higher power.<br /><br />Direct comparison to Strand Crawler:<br />1) higher Shield block <br />2) lower heal per turn<br />3) higher total HP healed<br />4) higher damage dealt (lower initial hit but has DoT)<br />5) crab is strong against critters, weak against flying<br />6) sapling is weak against critters, strong against mechanicals<br />7) 5 and 6 implies sapling might be stronger for PvP battles where people tend to have a mechanical pet quite often. ALso dot makes it unfriendly for capturing pets<br />8) crab can heal other pets, unlike sapling. That is particularly handy for switching pets with ramp up time, like Fluxfire Feline, where they can get couple heals first two rounds before they unleash their one shot ability.<br /><br />Choose wisely :)</div>
