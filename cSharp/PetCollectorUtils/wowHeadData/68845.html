Even the Whispering Pandaren Spirit has not a single actual Flying-type (though he has a Moth, it's flagged as a Critter-type). A couple of Pandaren have Glowflies, though the strategy of the Glowfly will be to double-poison you, then either Swarm or Slicing Wind until you die a slow [fast] and painful death from poison, so type-matching won't help much.\n\nEdit: I went hunting these and I'm (politely) using a battlestone, so I stopped when I came across a favourable build, though since I did waste a whelpling I figure the least I can do is share the information.\n\nI've seen two builds: Slightly attacky, and very attacky. Stat comparison for two grey level 19's post-capture runs thusly: 179\/160, and 200\/143, with equal hit points (860). The very attacky will always have an attack roughly 35% higher than its speed, no matter what quality you obtain. I'm taking the 200\/143 and using it with Tail Sweep. There is likely at least one more build I haven't seen yet.\n\nThanks to Valdemare, the builds seem to be slightly attacky, attacky, and very attacky, with the very attacky being the most desirable. I'm glad I chose the one I did. After applying a Battle Stone, it grew up to be 341\/244 with 1400hp. I don't see much reason to trade 35 attack for 13 points of speed and 65 additional hit points.","date":"2012-12-11T13:54:16-06:00","rating":5,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"There is 3d breed of Nexus whelping.

Okay, fellow wowheads, here's the scoop:\r\n1. Finding one to merely check it off your list is easy: Just fly to Coldarra and zig-zag around in the caldera until you see one. Grab the first one you find and leave.\r\n2. If you're wanting a rare, have plenty of time to kill. The respawn rate is atrocious, I averaged [u]one[\/u] every 15 to 20 minutes. So unless the gaming gods like you for some reason, this is gonna take a while.\r\n3. There is nothing you can do to [i]force[\/i] a spawn except wait. The only battle pets that appear in the caldera are the Whelpings so killing other pets is irrelevant.\r\n4. It will be accompanied by a Borean Marmot, Tundra Penguin, Shore Crab or Tundra Hare. Might as well grab a rare one of those if the Whelpling isn't worth a trap.\r\n5. Try to multi-task so you don't go too crazy: Put on your Safari Hat, add a healer to your group (Fawn, Black Sheep, Gazelle Fawn, etc.), put your Terrible Turnip in the team (you [u]do[\/u] have a turnip by now, right?) in case the rare shows up, and get an 18-19ish pet you want to level so you can at least get some XP in while you farm.\r\n6. Don't queue for a BG or instance while you circle around. While competition for these pets isn't nearly as fierce as it was a few months ago, most players in the area probably wouldn't be able to resist taking a swing at one today on the off-chance it [i]might[\/i] be a rare.\r\n7. If all of this seems like too much work, consider burning a Battle-Pet Upgrade Stone of the first one you find. I actually earned one a few battles before I finally caught a Rare (yes, that means I didn't follow my own advice. I used it on the [i]other[\/i] pain-in-the-butt pet, the Scourged Whelpling.)\r\nGood luck everyone and May the RNG Be With You!","date":"2013-07-27T01:25:35-05:00","rating":36,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Hey, I want to move to your server.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rossmallo</b></h3>Okay, here's the deal with these guys. <br /><br />They are <b>NOT</b> like Scourged Whelps - They spawn at any time, just kind of slowly and rarely. Keep orbiting Coldarra until you find one. <b>I can confirm one of thier spawn points is slightly northeast of the flight master.</b> (It's where I got mine.) <br /><br />As a battle pet, you need pets of approximately level 20 to battle and catch one successfully, especially considering you have to fight two other creatures for the capture to count. They have a pretty nice ability loadout, and because they get caught at level 19 (Level lost during catch) you can use all of the abilities almost right away. <br /><br />EDIT: With extensive further testing, I have discovered that these little guys are absoloutly godly for farming Lesser Charms and Battlestones. Pit a rare level 25 against level 20-21s, use Arcane Storm, use your primary attack to get the enemy down to a point where your Mana Surge will kill it, then use it. Assuming none of the Mana Surges miss, the combination of it and the Dragonkin racial has the potential to demolish the entire enemy team. If it does miss however, it will still kill the first one and either kill or seriously injure the second.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zivy</b></h3>Judging by comments, I'm going to guess these aren't force spawned in anyway? I've been flying around here (Haven't flown into anyone else in the zone) so as far as I can see, I'm alone, not one has spawned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>fungus6</b></h3>actually where it shows you what the quality of the pet is now you can start the pet battle and if it isnt a rare you can log out and log back in and the pet will still be there and you are out of the battle so you can still farm for the rare pet and not have to catch/kill all of the whelplings in the area</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aliandrin</b></h3>The Magic moveset on a Dragon-type makes this probably the best tailor-made opponent for a Flying-type in the entire game right now.<br /><br />The sad thing is, I can't really think of an NPC trainer off the top of my head (Other than Elena Flutterfly) who uses Birds. Even the Whispering Pandaren Spirit has not a single actual Flying-type (though he has a Moth, it's flagged as a Critter-type). A couple of Pandaren have Glowflies, though the strategy of the Glowfly will be to double-poison you, then either Swarm or Slicing Wind until you die a slow and painful death from poison, so type-matching won't help much.<br /><br />Edit: I went hunting these and I'm (politely) using a battlestone, so I stopped when I came across a favourable build, though since I did waste a whelpling I figure the least I can do is share the information.<br /><br />I've seen two builds: Slightly attacky, and very attacky. Stat comparison for two grey level 19's post-capture runs thusly: 179/160, and 200/143, with equal hit points (860). The very attacky will always have an attack roughly 35% higher than its speed, no matter what quality you obtain. I'm taking the 200/143 and using it with Tail Sweep. There is likely at least one more build I haven't seen yet.<br /><br />Thanks to Valdemare, the builds seem to be slightly attacky, attacky, and very attacky, with the very attacky being the most desirable. I'm glad I chose the one I did. After applying a Battle Stone, it grew up to be 341/244 with 1400hp. I don't see much reason to trade 35 attack for 13 points of speed and 65 additional hit points.</div>

Haven't seen one. 12/19/12 on Stormrage Server.<br /><br />Also, if you have <b>NPCscan</b> and are having a tough time finding rare pets, use their NPC ID from wowhead and add it to NPCScan. It's a nice little buzz when you've been circling around somewhere looking for these.<br /><br />Some I added for <b>Northrend</b> were:<br /><br /><b>Nexus Whelpling</b>: 68845<br /><b>Emerald Proto-Whelp</b>: 68850<br /><b>Scourged Whelpling</b>: 62854<br /><b>Stunted Shardhorn</b>: 62816<br /><b>Oily Slimeling</b>: 62697<br /><br />Hope this helps you and your sanity, especially if you are on a heavily populated server, full of people who like to collect battle pets like mine.<br /><br />Update: Finally, after 2.5 hrs, at 11pm Server time, 3 spawned around the circle... Got an Uncommon P/B version and am pretty happy. Coulda' been better, coulda' been worse. =P<br /><br />Update 2: Went on a smaller server with an 85 that I have... and I got a chance to look at 18 Whelps. No rares, but they respawned quickly at first then tapered off to zero. I got 13 in the first go-around, then 5 in the 2nd loop, then none for 3 more loops. They all spawned on snow, like others have said and they popped up with various pets: Borean Marmot, Arctic Hare, Tundra Penguin, and Shore Crab.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1012488</b></h3>Good Lord, what a grind! Okay, fellow wowheads, here's the scoop:<br />1. Finding one to merely check it off your list is easy: Just fly to Coldarra and zig-zag around in the caldera until you see one. Grab the first one you find and leave.<br />2. If you're wanting a rare, have plenty of time to kill. The respawn rate is atrocious, I averaged <u>one</u> every 15 to 20 minutes. So unless the gaming gods like you for some reason, this is gonna take a while.<br />3. There is nothing you can do to <i>force</i> a spawn except wait. The only battle pets that appear in the caldera are the Whelpings so killing other pets is irrelevant.<br />4. It will be accompanied by a Borean Marmot, Tundra Penguin, Shore Crab or Tundra Hare. Might as well grab a rare one of those if the Whelpling isn't worth a trap.<br />5. Try to multi-task so you don't go too crazy: Put on your Safari Hat, add a healer to your group (Fawn, Black Sheep, Gazelle Fawn, etc.), put your Terrible Turnip in the team (you <u>do</u> have a turnip by now, right?) in case the rare shows up, and get an 18-19ish pet you want to level so you can at least get some XP in while you farm.<br />6. Don't queue for a BG or instance while you circle around. While competition for these pets isn't nearly as fierce as it was a few months ago, most players in the area probably wouldn't be able to resist taking a swing at one today on the off-chance it <i>might</i> be a rare.<br />7. If all of this seems like too much work, consider burning a Battle-Pet Upgrade Stone of the first one you find. I actually earned one a few battles before I finally caught a Rare (yes, that means I didn't follow my own advice. I used it on the <i>other</i> pain-in-the-butt pet, the Scourged Whelpling.)<br />Good luck everyone and May the RNG Be With You!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1146855</b></h3>On my server, flew to Colderra and some were up. Poor, Poor, 10 later, common, then finally the uncommons.. 2.. 4... then a rare. Total time, an hour and a half. Just flew around and they would respawn by the time I got around again. While the spawn time is not great, it's better than other spawns and quick.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JasperKazai</b></h3>I'm probably one of the only people in this situation since I had quit during Cataclysm and abandoned quests, but I'll share anyways. If you are like me and are somewhere in the middle of the Firelands legendary questline, you will not be able to catch this pet. My character was at a part where Kalecgos is standing in the snow offering a quest and all of the mobs are &quot;dead.&quot; I was phased from the mobs that are usually in the area, and this includes the Nexus Whelplings. After flying around for a long while and then realizing this, I switched characters and almost immediately found a Nexus Whelpling. So be warned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1445728</b></h3>I was lucky enough to land near the FP here and their to be one spawned right by me. I fought it and sure enough it was a rare. Was easily able to capture it by shorting its heal using Arcane Explosion on my Chromonrius, switched to my lvl 20 clockwork gnome to finish off other two pets and was able to get a level and a new pet :D.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sagcat</b></h3>It appears to me that you can no longer capture the P/P Destruction breed of the Nexus Whelpling. Over the last three days, I have fought several dozen of these little guys and not a single one has been Destruction regardless of quality. Most have been P/B while a minority have been P/S. I have found no patch notes addressing it, but it looks like the P/P is no longer available.<br /><br />EDIT TO ADD: I was in fact, incorrect. My PetTracker add on was giving me poor information. I tried capturing every one of them, and after being captured, the P/P displayed correctly. I found and captured one. Thank you, wowhead community!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Silvansaria</b></h3>I actually found out I don't have this little guy by accident. I was actually looking at the OTHER pets I don't have and noticed the little icons for THIS guy...<br /><br />So I went hunting - flew around for awhile - and found 2 right next to each other. The first one I battled was a rare (rare power and speed).<br /><br />BAM!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jessmoo22</b></h3>Dont bother trying to get this. Since the Legion prepatch Coldarra has a major issue with phasing. Have been flying around the place for 3 hours now and I haven't seen a single battle pet. No paws on the mini-map at all and yes I am tracking pets. Also mobs phase in and out as I approach them. Sometimes disappearing when I get close.<br /><br />So I guess if you didn't get your Nexus Whelpling before Blizzard introduced the amazing new CRZ feature then you're just out of luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>djharris</b></h3>I think I might have this figured out. I did Colderra eons ago, but went there recently to find the <a href="/npc=68845/nexus-whelpling">Nexus Whelpling</a>s, and they never showed up, on multiple visits, even after killing everything in the zone. I also did the 'low level' quests in the zone with no luck.<br /><br />Then I went into '<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/the-eye-of-eternity">The Eye of Eternity</a>' raid in the center of the Colderra (there's a portal at the bottom of the energy beam in the center tower) and completed the raid solo in 25-player (I'm level 110 and I think this is a weekly reset so I think 25-player was automatic) and when I left, there were whelplings everywhere in the Colderra. Make sure you collect your raid reward from the 'crystal heart' inside the raid, which is hanging from the chin of <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=26917/alexstrasza-the-life-binder">Alexstrasza the Life-Binder</a> in her <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=31333/alexstrasza-the-life-binder#screenshots">dragon form</a> as a big red dragon that shows up when you complete the raid. This is also the raid that *might* drop the <a href="/item=43952/reins-of-the-azure-drake">Reins of the Azure Drake</a> or <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=43953/reins-of-the-blue-drake">Reins of the Blue Drake</a> mounts. I didn't do that the first time and no whelplings showed up, so this might be important.<br /><br />I used mostly <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=85220/terrible-turnip">Terrible Turnip</a> (1/2/2) and had <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=93040/anubisath-idol">Anubisath Idol</a> (1/1/1) and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=140261/hungering-claw">Hungering Claw</a> (1/1/2) as backup but never went to Claw. I had my pick at different Whelps and was able to collect all 3 variations (P/P, P/S, P/B). I was seeing from Common to Uncommon, levels 19-20, but worked on unique variations instead of worrying about rarity. I then went and spent Pet Charms to both level and rare-ify my new pets. FWIW, I went to <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/broken-isles-dalaran">Dalaran in the Broken Isles</a> and bought the Battle Stones from <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=115287/serrah">Serr'ah</a>, just right of the port/flight area, Krasus' Landing, when you enter the 'street':<br /><br />/way Dalaran:Broken Isles 58.76 38.07<br /><br />I hope this helps, I spent a couple of weeks to find them, both reading everything I could find and trying my own things. Completing the raid seemed to make an important difference. I hope it does for you, also.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mozhils</b></h3>I guess this is something new, but in the morning (around 8-9AM server time) there are plenty of them and they are respawning quite rapidly, while in the evening I spent more than an hour circling in Coldarra and none spawned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>butchkis</b></h3>I have been camping 2 low pop servers for a week, check in every few hours, and also at server reset time. Have not seen one in a week. Tried Realm hopping... no luck. Anyone seen one since 7.3 dropped?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>knewal</b></h3>after like 3 weeks of looking every day for this on RagnarosEU i decided to make an alt on the most unpopulated german rp server. That paid off. at around 17:40 realm time i went to coldarra as lvl 58 blood dk. They were up. I recomdent blood dk to everyone. You need to get out of combat to battle and you might need to kill a mob 12-14 lvl higher then you. <br />But a few thing:<br />they do not apear on minimap as pet icon and are very small like look at any whelping pet you have, that small . You need to run around on ground mount to spot them. I was looking for them on druid in flight form so maybe if flying at full speed they didn't have time to render. Got 2 PP and a PB editions just to be sure i never have to farm them again</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>GAWA</b></h3>So, I've been flying around Coldarra for 6 hours now on 3 different characters from 3 different realms and still no Nexus Whelpling!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>RotaryLUL</b></h3>I can confirm that in the morning there are loads of them, just leave your character there and when you log back in the morning, you can get your whelpling (I caught 3 just in case ;p)<br /><br />PS: ALL of them show on the minimap as pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Khorghast</b></h3>I just wanted to echo and backup what others have said about time of day. I circled Coldarra for about an hour one evening without seeing a single spawn. Checked Wowhead, and logged off at the Coldarra FP. Logged back on shortly after 9AM server time and there were close to 20 Nexus Whelpling spawns all around the loop. They DID appear on my minimap. I didn't see any rares, but it only took about 15 minutes to nab 2 P/Ps and a P/S for stoning later. Hope this helps for anyone still on the hunt for these guys.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ace00909</b></h3>I'm throwing in my experience with this pet as well (as of 7.3.5); I searched hours during all times of day on US servers (of varying populations) to find this pet but found absolutely nothing. I decided to try my hand on oceanic servers so I made a DK and went to Coldarra as soon as I left DK starting zone (Borean Tundra scales at level 58 now so no worries over dying to level 70 mobs). The time was around 10:00-10:30 AM server time. I found several of these little punks flying around and landed a rare on my second capture. So I don't know what it is about US servers (probably a population thing where many people jump on it early in the morning) but oceanic servers seem to have a lot of luck with it. 10:00 AM server time on oceanic - Aman'Thul is around 8:00 PM EST. It took me around 90 minutes from character creation to capturing my pet so give it a try if the time is right. Also these DEFINITELY show up as capturable pets (green minimap icon) on your minimap. Make sure you're tracking them.<br /><br />EDIT: I highly recommend using a Terrible Turnip to reduce its health to 1 instead of accidentally killing it. These are rare to find so you don't want any mistakes!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BlueyBooCakes</b></h3>Spent a few hours one evening flying around Coldarra looking for this guy with no luck. Read through the comments on here and noticed a familiar theme of &quot;morning time on my server&quot;. So I made a 100 Trial Character on an oceanic server (was 11:00am server time) and voilÃ  Nexus Whelplings all over. So if you want to test out the morning theory, make a Trial 100 on a different server. Once you load into the trial area hearth out. You can go to Legion Dalaran or use whatever travel methods you wish; all flight paths are discovered and available for your trial.<br /><br />Note: This Trial 100 Character method works for all your battle pet needs. I've farmed weather dependent pets this way as well. (Silithid Hatchling and Baby Ape)<br /><br />Just know that you have 8 /played hours on a Trial Character, OR until you unlock an artifact.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cordell9</b></h3>Ok anyone still trying to get one of these<br />I can confirm on 10/21/2019 that I went there at 9am server time and they were all over.<br />Now finding a rare is much tougher.
