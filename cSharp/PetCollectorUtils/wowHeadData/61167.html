<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jeolene</b></h3>So, once again, blizz has sent product out without quality control testing. I did some research and searching in game and found out that there is indeed a Mountain Cottontail in Mulgore... but that it is one of the horde's battlepet trainer's pet, meaning you can't battle it to capture it.<br /><br />So, since we can't get the Qiraji Guardling anyway, it looks like they have some time to fix this issue... if they decide to.

It no longer has those regular colors nor a white with a shine to it. My bunny is.... GOLDEN! Every time I summon it too. Just found out that 'Elfin' rabbit has the same deal, golden with shine.<br /><br />Latest Edit - When you repeatedly summon this bunny, you have a chance to summon the shiny color for it! So they didn't entirely remove it after all and now it gives others the shiny one no matter what bunny they capture! :)<br /><br />Guys and girls! If you are looking to getting one of these, and are up for a challenge...<br /><br /><s>Try your luck at getting a rare shiny one, they come in a very odd shiny metalic white color, it's very unique, not sure if it's on any other types of catchable rabbits or not o.O, but worth it! I'm not much of a fan for the rabbits due to blockiness but this one caught my attention fast, good luck all :)</s></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bigwurm</b></h3>Wasn't able to find one of these in Kalimdor so I went to Redridge and had one in less than a minute. And the best part is it counted towards Kalimdor Safari Achievment! Caught it at (51.5, 59.4) in Redridge.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aliandrin</b></h3>To obtain a rare shiny white one of the proper breed, use this pro tip:<br /><br />Encounter a rare Mountain Cottontail <b>as a secondary pokemon</b>. It does not matter what the colour of the bunny is at this point. Forfeit your battle, and the secondary bunny will be as it was in every way (quality, breed, level, stats) except that it will pick its colour again.<br /><br />Simply forfeit and reset your secondary bunny 'til he's shiny and white. You want the super speedy breed; it's good for defeating the Pandaren Earth Spirit. I simply used this trick until I found a speedy one (not rare) and upgraded him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>In the new UI, the updated 'Shiny' look to the Mountain Cottontail shows in the book as a golden rabbit. However, when you actively summon the rabbit, it pops up as any of the 'normal' wild rabbit colors. I have yet to see it actually *summon* as the golden rabbit.<br /><br />In addition, as of yet, I haven't seen a golden/shiny one out in the wild. I'm not sure whether this means they are exceedingly rare, or whether it means they no longer exist as a 'shiny' entity in the wild..... or if you can only tell *after* you catch them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Blatherskite</b></h3>As of 7.1, the Shiny/Glossy Mountain Cottontail is back, with the new fluffy-bun model! It is white without pink inner ears, and you can see a metallic glimmer to the coat. I uploaded a screenshot comparing the new shiny/glossy and a normal white in the new model. (Edit to update version)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MRTF</b></h3>This is an actual animal in real life that lives in Canada and some other places.<br /><br />PS. The shiny breed still exists, I caught a lvl 23 rare with shiny silver color. Not sure if a golden one exists though. Named her Shiny Miss :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>NMIV</b></h3>I read about a rare Mountain Cottontail (shiny white) being able to change colors when you spawn it. <br />Does anyone know if it has been removed? Searched long to get my rare shiny Mountain Cottontail,<br />only to get disappointed that it does not change colors...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kanooshie</b></h3>I've had a grey-quality, level 5 one of these in my collection for a long time now, and today I noticed that the icon was golden, so I summoned it and my rabbit was shiny and gold too! Not too sure how or why, but it <i>is</i> possible to get gold ones!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>alienfantom</b></h3>So just found out about this whole thing when I seen someone with a golden elfin rabbit. I was freaking out and had to figure out how to get one! Or the toy to make it look golden. Then finally found out that you just catch them and I ended up on here wondering what the shinny Mountain Rabbit was. After I read some comments I decided to go to red ridge and go spend hours to try and catch one... BUT! The second rabbit I seen at Redridge was the shinny! I should have taken a pic of it before I started trying to catch it but I was too excited and did not want anyone to get it before I did! So you can see the rabbit is shiny before ever even catching it, it was hopping around all shinny like then I battled it and it was still shinny, then I caught it and it was shinny after I summoned it! I've been summoning it a couple of times to see if it turns gold but have not yet seen it become gold so I think I got a pure bred shinny! Going to uplode my pictures of silver (what I named the lil guy) next to my lightning paw and one of him versing my crazy carrot! (because it only makes sense to try and bait a rabbit in with a carrot!) <br />Edit: after uploding the photos I went back to my game and caught a second one XD. So I seen 3 rabbits and 2 of them where shinny!</div>
