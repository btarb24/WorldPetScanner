<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kiyosue</b></h3>P/S is a possible breed. Caught rare one tonight around 53,70 in Highmountain.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cstober2010</b></h3>I just found and captured rare(blue) <a href="/npc=97126/northern-hawk-owl">Northern Hawk Owl</a> in Highmountain (50,81) AKA a trench within Greystone. It was behind a little barricade of stones, next to two 110 Greystone Slingers overlooking a cliff. It was beginning to fly away, so I frantically engaged it. My pets were around 50% hp, it was a close fight but luckily this thing didn't seem to hit too hard. Also, thank the stars that you can engage a pet from so far away...as I was level 104 at the time - so I didn't aggro the 110s. <br /><br />You <u>cannot</u> cage this pet. This and the awesome model leads me to believe this might be a <a href="/npc=71163/unborn-valkyr">Unborn Val'kyr</a> type-farm. The model looks like a sentry hawk from WC3! lovin it already. Good luck &amp; Happy Hunting.<br /><br />EDIT: The 2 <a href="/npc=101812/greystone-slinger">Greystone Slinger</a> are playing <a href="/spell=200866/ring-toss">Ring Toss</a> at the end of this trench, overlooking Suramar. This is the same trench where <a href="/npc=101649/frostshard">Frostshard</a> patrols.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thundwrath</b></h3>I've engaged 4 of these now - accidentally killed the first, caught the next two, and am presently battling the fourth. All have been rare. I think it just spawns that way. They aren't hard to find - go up the hill north of the Ironhoof Enclave, I found 3 flying around the mountain after finding my first one in a cave.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TinyOctopus</b></h3>If you're on the third leg of the quest chain for your Snowfeather Hatchling, be aware that you can capture the Northern Hawk Owl and it still counts as a win.<br /><br />Also, they also spawn in the canyon near Greystone, so don't just run around Ironhorn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kilocke</b></h3>Unlike the name suggests, these are not found in the <u>northern</u> area of Highmountain, but are found in the <u>southern</u> area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Voith</b></h3>These have a long-ish respawn timer (+3hrs at least).<br /><br />I was doing the quest for Snowfeather Hatchling, so I used that plus:<br /><br />Emerald Proto-Whelp (Uncommon) Emerald Bite/Emerald Presence/Emerald Dream<br />Iron Starlette (Rare) Wind-Up/Powerball/Supercharge<br /><br />The EPW was for the Northern Hawk Owl. Keep Emerald Presence up and Emerald Dream as needed.<br />Iron Starlette was for the beast/critter friends. Wind-Up and Supercharge on CD.<br /><br />I'm sure there are faster ways, but this seemed foolproof.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jilliene</b></h3>If you can't find any to spawn like me.. and you've murdered all the poor snails and bunnies and non-petbattle-able hawks in the area, just go and hop realms &gt;&lt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ArmandFrvr</b></h3>Looks like there can only be ~2 of these up at a time. They actually spawn somewhat outside the area indicated by the Snowfeather Hatchling quest. Found the first one in the Drogbar area ~57,92. There was a second one underground in the same area, which turned out to be in the back of Stonecrown Cavern (entrance is to the left and up the mountain from 54,89). One also can spawn at 54, 89 but you won't be able to battle it due to terrain, so just kill it if it's up. If a critter version spawns there, leave it so the pet won't. Got my final one at 57,71 just above Drugon. I was continuously killing critter versions other than the one at the bottom of the hill, but no idea if it helped since no battle pets spawned at the locations where I was killing critters other than the first one I saw at the bottom of the hill where I couldn't battle it.</div>
