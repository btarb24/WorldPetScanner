I never did find a rare during the evening. I logged over a Val'kyr spawn point and tried early the next morning. Spawns refreshed overnight and I found that 80-90% of the spawn points on the map were occupied. I worked my way west to east, and found 3 rares before completing my curcuit of the map.","creationdate":"2014-09-06T06:40:00-05:00","id":770139,"rating":0,"commentid":1974921,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"vetteranger","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":20,"id":2008277,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Aliandrin","body":"As a hunter, what you want to do is fly up high, use Tranquilising Shot, and Disengage before you hit the ground, saving you from the fall damage.\n\nYour Eaglet will then need another Tranquilising Shot before it completely reaches you on the ground, in order to stay aggroed.

Found mine resting at the base of a tree in the wooded area north of Camp Oneqwah in Grizzly Hills. Was starting a low-altitude flight as I went to click on it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>367644</b></h3>These can be frustrating to even click on as most of the ones I've come across have been up in the trees, unclickable for a battle.<br /><br />If you're a class with a taunt of some kind, you can taunt them down. It will put you in battle at first, run away a bit but not too far and when it resets, there's a second or two you can click on it to battle.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>86356</b></h3>I found two fawns as backup for the first imperial eagle chick I battled, one uncommon, one rare. I captured the rare Fawn and spent a little time finding another chick.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vizime</b></h3>Faily easy to spot. Flew around Grizzly hills at first, but when I didn't see any quickly I checked Wowhead. I have seen already 5+ around the map and I could all click them (except for one that was in a wall on the northeast side of Grizzly Hills.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kaytie</b></h3>Took a while to find any, luckily my first was a rare so I don't have the pain of tracking them for days! <br /><br />They tend to be in or around trees, most often on the chopped stumps that are scattered throughout the zone, but sometimes flying or up in a tree. Stick to the more densely wooded areas, and you'll be much more likely to track one down.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sospitatrix</b></h3>It might have just been my experience, but i noticed that when I selected this pet it went flying and it only got down again when I selected something else. They are not too hard to find, but their flying can be a little annoying.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1050751</b></h3>If your toon is a priest, and the imperial eagle chick is flying too far up--fly a bit above the eagle, dismount and quickly levitate, when you're floating past, next to the eagle chick use psychic scream. the eagle will get feared, fly down, and when it gets close he'll start to fly back up, you'll have a quick chance to join battle before he'll fly back to the top of his tree :)<br />ETA: seems to work on most that I've found but a few are flying too high, but do try this! for some of them it will work at least :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lorax42</b></h3>Here's a tip if you have a mage:<br /><br />1. Make sure you have the interact with target keybound. I use the ` key (next to 1).<br />2. Fly up beyond the bird.<br />3. Feather Fall past him and cast slow on him as you fall. The slow spell won't kill him, but i will aggro him.<br />4. If your bird was really high up, start spamming the interact button. I used this specifically when the bird was so far up in the air, that by the time it got down to me, it was resetting. As it started flying away, we weren't in combat anymore, but I could engage the pet battle.<br />5. If distance is not an issue, go invisible to drop aggro and begin battle.<br /><br />Problem solved.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1071299</b></h3>Flew into Grizzly hills and bumped into one right away....had a blue fawn with him...but after reading this post id figure just to go for the imperial eagle chick.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Znaleziatko</b></h3>There is quite a lot of them in the zone. Some of them are flying too high or sitting on a tree - best to just leave them. For all the rest - targeting it with a macro and then interacting-with-target (hotkeyed) works very well. They very often have a <b>rare</b> <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62818">Grizzly Squirrel</a> or <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=61677">Mountain Skunk</a> as a secondary pet, so don't even bother hunting especially for those - you will get them in the proccess anyway.<br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>36722</b></h3>If you're a hunter trying to bring one down that's up in the air, this macro will do it for you:<br /><br />/cast Distracting Shot<br />/stopattack<br /><br />Distracting Shot does no damage, and stopattack turns off your autoshot before it ever goes off. Fly up until you're in range, hit that and fall to the ground, then feign when the bird gets to you. Quickly start the battle after feigning, and you have yourself a bird!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1065234</b></h3>The problem with the chicks flying seems to have been corrected. Every one I found tonight was either on the ground or only flew a short way up before landing again. No longer need to pass up other rare pets while hunting for your imperial eagle chick!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Anamcha</b></h3>Growling/shadowmeld worked really well for getting mine. Lucky I got a rare on first try.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>508975</b></h3>The area around Conquest Hold has most of its trees cut down, and I find the chicks in that area resting on rocks, which are more easily battleable.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wyldblossom</b></h3><b>Finding rare Imperial Chick painful!</b><br />Perhaps I've been unlucky. I have been flying around the area over four separate days, battling everything in sight and going around the entire Grizzly Hills zone. Found plenty of chicks but still no rare *sob*. I have picked up a flawless battlestone, but am reluctant to upgrade chick with it, since I SHOULD be able to catch a blue.</div>
