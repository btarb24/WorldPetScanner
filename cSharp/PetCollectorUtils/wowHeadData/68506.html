I don't think they exist.&quot; - The Princess Bride<br /><br />Thanks for the update.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MMOSimca</b></h3>They're called &quot;Sumprush Rodents&quot; so you figure they would be located in Townlong Steppes in the &quot;Lower Sumprushes&quot; or the &quot;Upper Sumprushes&quot; along with the &quot;Sumprusher Mist Lurkers&quot; who give out &quot;Sumprush&quot; maces.<br /><br />Edit: Actually, they're obtained from 2000x Commissions from the new PvP areas in Krasarang Wilds apparently. You can get a &quot;Rodent Crate&quot; from the vendors for your faction.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>antioch</b></h3>These guys are obtained from the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=92527">Rodent Crate</a>, which costs 2000x <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=91838">Lion's Landing Commission</a> or <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=91877">Domination Point Commission</a>, purchasable from your faction's commission vendor in patch 5.1 in Krasarang Wilds. If you're looking for a quick way to farm these, check out my post under the Lion's Landing Commission link.<br /><br />Note that you do not get the pet directly, but instead temporarily activate Sumprush Rodents as battle critters. When I purchased a box, the entire area near the commendation vendor gets bathed in <b>fast respawning</b> Sumprush Rodents for 20 minutes. They are not visibly restricted to only the crate user and there appears to be a zone-wide alert when you have used the box.<br /><br />They respawn as long as the box lasts, so no need to fight over them. If you're planning on getting a box and putting one down you may want to let your friends and guildies know beforehand so they can get theirs.<br /><br />Edit: For those asking, it's a max level 25 pet. Not sure about the two accompanying pets but I believe they are as well. And of course capture de-levels it to 23.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>699353</b></h3>I found loads at domination point around 9.8, 52.9. It was 13:30. <br />15 mins later they were all gone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SpiderBrush</b></h3>I bought a crate of these today and have to say I was quite disappointed. After spending several days farming the 2000 Lion's Landing Commissions and in the twenty minutes that the rodents were active I didn't come across a single Rare quality one. I captured the first green Uncommon one I engaged and white flagged the rest in the hope of finding a Rare quality one, but it wasn't to be. The twenty minutes soon expired. Now I have to spend another several days farming another 2000 Lion's Landing Commissions.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Khajar</b></h3>I used my crate today. But before doing it, I warned everyone in the Trade Channel. Then I flew by all maps of Pandaria, warning in the General Channel too.<br /><br />When I returned to Domination Point, the place was crowded! Everyone waiting in front of the box... The poor critters barely moved...<br />I didn't mind the competition though, because I already had this pet.<br />I only used the box to help a friend of mine... But then I thought: why not help the whole realm? ^^<br />After a few minutes, someone said he got a rare one (mine was common) so I decided to try too.<br />In the last 30 sec of the crate, I found a rare one! Guess it was karma...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Znaleziatko</b></h3>As the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=92527">Rodent Crate</a> says, pets appear at Domination Point. No matter at which exact spot you use the crate - they will spawn in the main camp of Domination Point.<br /><br />There are always five pets active - it spawns right after you finish a battle. After 20 minutes they don't disappear, they just stop spawning.<br /><br />They are level 24 or 25. Their secondaries are always the same level as the Rodent and are basically all the pets you can catch in Krasarang Wilds. In 28 battles I got 3 rares.<br /><br />Hope this helps and happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Iconyx</b></h3>The Rodent Crate has changed. As of 5.2, they continue spawning for at least 40 minutes (timed it on 3/6/13) and there may or may not be a finite number of them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>erSch</b></h3>As of 5.4, these can no longer be killed directly, out of pet battle. This means, you have to kill at the first pet and cancel the pet battle, so a new one can respawn. <br />Looking for a rare, I suggets to use a mechanical pet, which is strong against beast pets, to kill the rodent quickly, which is always the first pet in every combat.<br /><br />Also, the cage does no longer last 20 minutes, but a full hour, now.</div>

I suppose perhaps I was fighting a remaining one from an old crate since I did not use one myself. I just thought I'd give you a heads up. When I arrived there were a total of 3, I captured the other two but none of them were rare. The rare one was never seen again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>nirv</b></h3>I just want to confirm since nobody mentioned it: <br /><br />You cannot see the Sumprush Rodents if you have not done the prequests for Domination Point. If the island is barren and dead, you won't see them after they've been unleashed from the Rodent Crate. <br /><br />However, if you have unlocked the island and can actually see Ongrom Black Tooth (NPC, Horde), you'll be able to capture both B/B and H/B breeds of this pet. Just did it tonight on Mal'Ganis 2015/11/14!<br /><br />Edit: Confirmed on the timer, too. We opened the crate at 3:19am and they were still wandering around at 4:22am. Disappeared at 4:23am.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>westaiv</b></h3>I farmed for this pet for a couple hours not knowing that it would just unleash them from their crate and you would need to battle them to capture them. The item name was different &quot;Rodent Crate,&quot; but this isn't unusual when it comes to items that when clicked become caged pets. I knew that there was a pet at this vendor for which I would have to grind out the currency. This is to be expected. However, after clicking on the item and seeing all the pets scatter, I quickly clicked on one and checked with my addon that showed there were two breeds available. I thought that I would have plenty of time to get both breeds but after finishing the first pet battle, there wasn't any pets in the vicinity. This is when I knew that I had been sharded/phased. There doesn't seem to be any information for this in these comments so I hope someone reads this information to be prepared for when this happens. It may be that you are not able to click on any of them before being sharded to a different realm which makes for a crappy waste of two hours. I don't see myself being able to get the other breed of this pet since it took so long and there is a chance that I won't get it the second or third time because of RNG and the sharding tech. I also don't see Blizzard being any help in this matter. If you've had a similar problem, please reply to this comment and tell your story. Sometimes, it's okay not to shard.</div>

Only a few will re-spawn between each rotation.<br />Depending on the speed you may want to check it every 2nd or every 4th, depends how fast/slow you are.<br /><br />At Quickchop's Lumber Farm, the start point, you will find that once you get going and have done a few loops around the whole rotation that mobs will start re-spawning as you are killing them there, but this quickly stagnates.<br />When they stop re-spawning is when you fly away from Quickchop's Lumber Farm to the forest. They stop re-spawning fairly quickly, but it obviously adds up.<br /><br />At Quickchop's Lumber Farm you don't need to mount up between waypoints, in the forest I go in Flight Form between each waypoint. Depending on your class some of the waypoints there may be faster to run to instead of taking the time to mount up.<br />As a Druid I kill everything at Quickchop's Lumber Farm then go into Flight Form and fly back and loot. In the forest I mount up and loot inbetween each waypoint.<br /><br />List of <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tomtom" rel="nofollow">TomTom</a> waypoints<i>(use the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/paste" rel="nofollow">Paste</a> addon)</i>:<br /><br />This image explains the route: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/H0UeYtZ.png" rel="nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/H0UeYtZ.png</a><br /><br /><div class="quote-box">/way 20.03, 58.54<br />/way 20.98, 59.56<br />/way 20.04, 60.59<br />/way 18.84, 61.42<br />/way 19.41, 63.12<br />/way 20.75, 62.89<br />/way 25.79, 57.63<br />/way 26.24, 53.40<br />/way 24.99, 55.71<br />/way 24.25, 53.26<br />/way 22.38, 53.17<br />/way 22.36, 51.07<br />/way 20.74, 51.36<br />/way 20.07, 49.74<br />/way 19.15, 51.43</div><br /><br />This is my farm macro:<br /><br /><div class="quote-box">/cleartarget<br />/tar Jungle &lt;----------------------------- The name of the NPC you are farming.<br />/stopmacro <br />/cast Sunfire &lt;-------------------------- Your spamable ability to kill them.<br /></div></div>
