<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mehetabel</b></h3>As of 25/12/20, this little guy seems a tad glitchy. In addition to not being able to use a leveling stone on him, he seems to have different appearances when summoned. My friends Jingles (visible to us both) arrived wearing a Christmas wreath and holding a candy-cane, yet my Jingles, when summoned, had neither.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Marigan</b></h3>Although the pet appears to be currently glitchy (it is in my case at the time of writing this) it is fortunate the Pet Battle Bonus Event is this week. I was able to go to the Master Tamers in Draenor and get Jingles leveled through Ashlei and Vesharr to level 25.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Barhah</b></h3>This raptor truly is the best at holding things. If you can find some way to <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=127696">turn into it</a>, you'll be holding your off-hand and it's super tiny! It makes your enchantments glow a little hard, but I'm submitting a screenshot of it where my main hand is barely visible under the candy cane (which presumably will be gone after Winter Veil ends), you can see my <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=134007">giant ring</a>, and my far-too-glowy off-hand is visible. Truly a Winter Veil miracle :B</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Phakalyalle</b></h3>How do I get the one with the decorations? I got the plain one, and can't learn more. So there's two models, you don't know what it is til you learn it, then you are stuck with it - can't cage, can't trade, etc. It stays the plain one with each summon so it doesn't change with that either. I have tons of plain raptor pets and was excited to get a cutely decorated one, but didn't. Is this intentional? Am I missing something?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ziboo</b></h3>Appreciate the thought, as who doesn't want more pets? But come Blizz - two models and we can't learn them both? We can't even tell which we have until we've learned one. Then what delete it and keep opening gifts on alts hoping to get the one with the holiday appearance? Seems a bit poorly thought out imho.<br /><br />And why not make it cageable? More and NEW pets to trade/sell on the AH would be a good idea I'd think.</div>
