<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Foggy85</b></h3>There are a couple spawns in the Chitterspine Grotto just west of the Gate of the Queen. I found one spawn on the upper level and one spawn down below with the pool that sets off a dangerous area warning. Bear in mind, catching one of these is quite a trial and I'm not even sure how you'd do it solo without a stealth class. My main is a druid so I was able to prowl very carefully up to one. Your main obstacles are elite crabs, packs of smaller crabs that enrage and hit quite hard, and medium-sized crabs that hang around the cave in stealth (and are quite good at detecting you).<br /><br />What I noticed is the stealthed crabs tend to be against walls or pillars (mostly) so if you stealth carefully through the middle of the cave you should be able to get to one of the Hissing Chitterspines before you are detected. Catch that sucker and die shortly after, constantly reminding this silly crab what you went through to give them a good home.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>samus2195</b></h3>Mine spawned at the following coord<br /><br />50:33 (within the cave)<br />42:7 (on nazjatar overall map)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shashos</b></h3>There are some torches just outside the Chittering cave (and also some inside) that put an effect on you which scares the crabs briefly. I was able to use one inside the cave to get a large group of crabs off me temporarily so I could run deeper to where the battlepet was located.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>The bad news is that only one 'fightable' chitterspine is able to be spawned at a time. It seems to have 2 or 3 spawn points inside the cavern. <br />The good news is that near-instantly upon being defeated/killed, another will spawn somewhere in the cave. This may be right in front of you, or it may be at another of the spawn points. <br />As such, grinding for your rare could be very dangerous with all the crabs about, but not impossible. Especially for a stealth class.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tyrsenus</b></h3>Hissing Chitterspine is located in Chitterspine Grotto, at the northern edge of Nazjatar.<br /><br />/way Nazjatar 42.4, 13.2 Chitterspine Grotto Entrance<br /><br />The cave is crawling with crabs that <i>will </i>quickly kill you. Here's how to stay out of combat and start the pet battle:<br /><br /><ol><li>Locate the Hissing Chitterspine in the cave <b>FIRST</b> using /tar Hissing.</li><li>Use <a href="/item=116268/draenic-invisibility-potion">Draenic Invisibility Potion</a>, enter the cave, and move to the Hissing Chitterspine.</li><li>Remove the invisibility buff and spam click the Hissing Chitterspine.</li></ol><br /><br />P.S. Don't bother with <a href="/object=325892/deeplight-torch">Deeplight Torch</a> at the cave entrance. It will keep the crabs off you, but it won't drop you from combat (and you can't start a pet battle in combat).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Baldemar</b></h3>If you cant stealth and have a ranged attack go right and run into the middle of the cave...and you will die. Make sure you are in a ways. Do the long corpse run back. When you get to the cave this time go left and down, across the water to 51.06, 53.97. You should be able to rez in this area. There are no crabs right around this area so you have some room to work with. If you need to kill crabs take them on one at a time or small groups. What you want to do now is kill the Hissing Chitterspines up top when they spawn by ranged, and force the one down below to spawn. The new one spawns as soon as you kill the old one so just watch where they spawn.There may be one group of crabs you need to kill but its a lot easier battling the Hissing Chitterspine down below.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sadistic12345</b></h3>feels bad man white quality</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mortizzle</b></h3>The run in isn't that bad (393 ilevel managed no probs) . A solid aoe or pet gets you through fine. Just be careful not to inadvertently aoe the Hissing Chitterspine or you'll have to wait for respawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Demonae</b></h3>ilvl 400 DK in Blood, the crabs are easy, just don't pull than about 2 grps at a time. <br />You can have 3 of these pets.<br />Not cage-able, so dump any non-blues unless you want to upgrade them. <br />Got 3 blues in about 10 minutes. <br />You can kill these, so watch your aoe's.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Agrias</b></h3>Not hard to get but people posts can be confusing making you think it is a unique rare spawn at /way Nazjatar 42.4, 13.2.<br />It doesn't spawn at this exact spot, it's just the entrance to the cave in which he spawns. Just go inside and then use /tar Hissing macro.<br />It's not a super rare pet with long spawn or anything. Server hop if he's not there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Weasei</b></h3>Not got stealth? Don't want to pay expensive repair bills (or just run all the way from a GY)? I have good news for you!<br /><br />Grab a <a href="/object=325892/deeplight-torch">Deeplight Torch</a> from around the <a href="/npc=154913/shadowspike-lurker">Shadowspike Lurker</a> (/way 42.12, 13.75 Deeplight Torch)<br /><br />Run through the cave (ideally pulling as few enemies as you can) to where the single clickable <a href="/npc=154708/hissing-chitterspine">Hissing Chitterspine</a>. Nearby is a second <a href="/object=325892/deeplight-torch">Deeplight Torch</a> which you can use to top up your buff endlessly.<br /><br />Now kill all the enemies you've pulled, but remember that AoE spells will kill the battle pet, so avoid using them near to it. <br /><br />This technique is great as a spell-caster (personally did it as a Warlock - minion gets destroyed but buff keeps me safe regardless). I suspect it's not as much fun with a melee character as the enemies will constantly run away from you. Main thing is, you don't have to die if you would rather not!<br /><br />Edit: additional detail that could be useful is that the cave is the same layout as the cave you find Deeplight in, you want to head right at the first fork, and you'll find it down in the big open room.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Preuz</b></h3>I managed to obtain this pet very easily, I was omw to kill a rare in the same cave as this pet spawns in, turns out that you don't need stealth or anything else that is suggested here in the comments. Simply find where it is and try to dodge the large amount of chitterers, in case you get a lot of them - they are very much soloable in any case. Did this with ease!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Noctula</b></h3>I've lost count on how many times I died here but finally found a nice spot where I could begin the pet battle before being attacked and/or killed the pet because of having to fight the moment I ressurected.<br /><br />In the big room in the grotto, swim into the tunnel, beginning at /way 59.26 48.93 , it's one of the puddles and goes straight down in a narrow underwater tunnel.<br />In this tunnel you do not get attacked, so you can reset your arrow to /way 50.30 33.72<br />Then you come into a big lake, turn right and up.<br />I found the hissing chitterspine here on a sand bank between two waters. The big crabs are not so much of a trouble but the little ones running around are. These are solo easy to kill (I'm no mythic material, as a affliction warlock with iLevel 403). Then wait for the battle pet to respawn, in about 10 minutes.<br /><br />You probably have to die a few times trying. I had 444 gold of repairs. If the pet died because you had to fight the running smaller chitter nasties then wait 10 minutes and don't loot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Melandroso</b></h3>No need to stealth and such. The crabs are certainly killable, but if you can't, take the tip to dismiss your bodyguard at least! Those people really body pull with a vengence!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Samaramon1</b></h3>Honestly, this got way easier after I dismissed my guardian (he's a &quot;buff&quot;, you can't right click-dismiss him).<br /><br />I just found a pet inside the cave, ran in, died right next to it. Then ran back in, rezzed with my back against the cave, and killed off the 2-3 crabs that attacked me without moving and keeping in range of the pet. DON'T AOE! I killed the crabs one by one, then did the battle. No stealth or torch needed. Just die near it, clear whatever attacks you, then do the fight the old fashioned way.<br /><br />I'm a holy priest, so killing them one by one wasn't impossible.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hepcatsilverhand</b></h3>If you cant stealth... you can time it a right.<br />when you enter cave, look towards the right fork.<br />there is a Pat that comes to that point then goes back.<br />basically follow them but without aggro'ing.<br />quickly you will come to a pool, the Hissing chitt is just on the left.<br />jump down quick and engage.<br /><br />dont kill last pet until you can see the pat come back (you can see them in the battle ground as they approach)<br />once they have passed you, kill last pet then run like hell.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>onefreakycoppa</b></h3>Not sure if this has changed or not but I found it relatively simple to complete. I was worried I wasn't going to be able to get him reading some of the comments below but all I did was:<br /><br />1. Ran down to bottom pool killing whatever was in my way.<br />2. /tar Hissing<br />3. Used <a href="/item=109184/stealthman-54">Stealthman 54</a><br />4. I saw him, moved towards him, killed a few more little chitts away from him.<br />5. Battled him<br />6. Win.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Silvansaria</b></h3>This little guy...<br />I fought my way in - cleared everything right up to the Hisser - and then - he was taken out by some AoE... I waited for about 20 minutes - he never respawned so I'm not sure what his respawn timer actually is but I camped right there so next time I log in I'll just move over to the left away from him and kill everything.<br /><br />EDIT: 12-5-2019<br /><br />Turns out they spawn really fast all over that area both below where the original spawn point is and the upper level. Usually 2-3 at a time. I hit all greens (and a few whites) for the most part and then finally got a rare as a secondary. You can get more - but it's a real hassle trying to get there and keep it clear as you run around and around...<br /><br />A note about actually getting there - unless your gear is low 120 beginner gear - it's really easy to fight your way in and even easier to keep the area clear.<br />As a Hunter I got massive healing (in addition to massive dps) with the new gear - so I can get easily mobbed by 2 groups and some elites and tear them apart all at the same time without taking much damage. So don't be afraid to engage and don't worry about those worthless torches and don't worry about wasting your invisibility potions or stealthing your way. Just go in there and kick face. You'll be fine.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mcdisney2001</b></h3>As a mage with crummy gear, I made a macro that said &quot;/tar hissing&quot;. I grabbed the flashlight and ran in, taking the first right, I then grabbed another flashlight in the big room. All the while, I spammed /tar hissing until I found the pet. (Make sure you have &quot;Target&quot; checked in your map options.) I then popped Invisibility, ran to the crab, and engaged him.<br /><br />If your Invisibility runs out before you reach the pet and you get put into combat, just try to die near him.<br /><br />FYI, I took a Flying pet (for strong against Aquatics) and an Undead (for weak against Aquatics, so I could weaken him without murdering him LOL).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aceofblue</b></h3>In Patch 8.3, this cave is trivial, at least at a moderate gear level (BM Hunter, ilvl 460). I did not have to use any of the preparations (stealth potions, speed boosts, etc) that were detailed for patch 8.2.5. The respawn rate on the Hissing Chitterspines is still quite high, so it's much safer now than it used to be to farm for a rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tanae</b></h3>For those without TomTom, the opening to the cave, Chitterspine Grotto is north Nazjatar, right by the Q in Gate of the Queen. Also right next to the Pet Battler Shadowspike Lurker</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kyukket</b></h3>managed to get 2 this AM (sorry, no coords...first one was straight in right where the large main cave opens up, and second was further in and down near caverndark terror)...kept deeplight torch going, and AOE'd mobs in small groups to keep them from running until all were dead (had to run to a torch a lot or stand near one)...fortunately, the respawn time on the regular mobs is kinda long, so this worked out well...took me about 40 minutes total to catch both</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurotan</b></h3>With 460+ gear you can just run in and kill everything in one pull. Found the pet down in the lower level of the cave. Used Terrible Turnip and Snobold Runt because of their Weakening Blow abilities that can't reduce enemy health below 1.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>antman09</b></h3>If you have Neri Sharpen she will most likely do fan of knives and kill any the few around you if you have adds on you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Malmortius13</b></h3>Go to the Q from Gate of the Queen, there is a cave inside, you'll find lots of those, they spawn really fast btw</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Exephia</b></h3>Chitterspine Grotto is by far the easiest/quickest. Took less than 30 seconds to find one.<br /><br />/way 62.85, 73.69</div>
