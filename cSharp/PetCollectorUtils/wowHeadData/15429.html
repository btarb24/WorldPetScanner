I've read a little about it before, so i did'nt think i could get it. The Oozeling dropped after 27 minutes of farmin, from the 8th bag.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>phantomeagle</b></h3>I flew up to Light Hope's Chapel, dropped into the scars. Bag dropped on 4th kill, and there was my oozling.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>208104</b></h3>When it comes to rare drops there is always one annoying fool that gets it on there first go. This time it was me!<br /><br />I'm a bit of noob at this point and didn't know that this existed, I laughed my ass off when I got it, even harder when I noticed it's aura.<br /><br />Got the little bugger in Felwood when farming tainted ooze at level 54.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>766425</b></h3>Got it on first Bag!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zhua</b></h3>maybe i'm not looking hard enough but i've been to both places marked for this pet &amp; there is no slime for bags to even drop from.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Solacia</b></h3>This thing (at rare quality) is crazy overpowered for pet battling. <br />It has two abilities (Corrosion and Acidic Goo) that do DoT damage and increase damage taken and work in synergy to increase the damage of both dots, and then an absorb on no cooldown that benefits from both increase damage debuffs.<br /><br />It's just a total monster of a tank, although it does fall short against dragonkin abilities, especially Scorched Earth. If you see something with that come out, get him out of there</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cmacord</b></h3>OMG, got one from the 2nd bag that dropped, and it was a <b><u>Rare</u></b>!<br /><br />I think I'll log off and go buy some lottery tickets...:)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TevishSzat</b></h3>There's a neat trick with this guy and the Brazier of Dancing Flames. Set down the Brazier, type /dance (but do not submit it), then hit &quot;summon&quot; for this pet and quickly thereafter, enter. If you time it right, which isn't too hard with a little practice, you'll turn into the dancing fire dranei before the oozeling actually spawns and turns you green. Your model will be green, but the fire effects will remain orange, leaving an interesting visual<br /><br />As a battle pet, the Disgusting Oozeling is, in fact, very strong. As others have noticed, it can stack &quot;Increases damage taken&quot; + Damage over Time effects, quickly depleting the health of most opponents while &quot;powering up&quot; absorb to maintain health. Of particular note while leveling, though, is the ability Expunge. I initially wrote this ability off as being like Cataclysm, Instability, or Demolish: far too unreliable to consider using. However, while Expunge's damage is much higher than that of a standard attack (on par with other &quot;high miss&quot; moves), its hit rate isn't actually that bad: 80%, the same as Burrow and related moves. It's actually quite good.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1053884</b></h3>make alt on high pop server (way cheaper pets there) with herbalism and mining, lvl until you get enough for a disgusting oozeling, <br />lvl the oozeling to lvl 25 on same alt while you continue to gather materials to sell (crazy xp and more gold for more oozelings)<br />log main on medium/low server, sell the lvl 25 oozeling for up to 15k<br /><br />rinse and repeat</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>midobu</b></h3>I just got this pet <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=38374">Toxic Wasteling</a>. It is the same model as Disgusting Oozeling. The most fun part for this pet is not only it eats critters but also it grows bigger.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Delectatio</b></h3>As of early MoP release, the best place (IMO) to farm these, are in Swamp of Sorrows. Right outside The Harborage, there is some water going in different directions which has Oozes in them. As a level 90 that one shots the Oozes, I've found it easy to farm there, just because they respawn so quickly. When you are done with one round of killing spree, you can start all over again immediately.<br /><br />In my experience it has taken anywhere from 10 minutes to 3 hours before I have the Oozeling in my bag. I've farmed the Oozeling around 8-10 times for friends and the Auction House. <br /><br />Good luck on your hunt. I hope you will be happy with this adorable little slime clump.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>914334</b></h3>If you are getting this guy for his utility as a battle pet, you can more easily acquire a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=61718">Jade Oozling</a>, not only are they are easier to acquire, they have the exact same moveset and come in better breed varieties such as P/P and H/H.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Invaderzen</b></h3>As of 6/26/2015 and the release of 6.2 this pet no longer turns you and your mount green. No more pretend green Flametalons :(<br /><br />Edit: 7/27/2015 The green coloring effect has been returned!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>powermonkey500</b></h3>If you want this pet to make your mount look cool, it does NOT work while flying. As soon as you take off, the effect goes away.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Blowmyarrow</b></h3>Just go to Silithus, fly around and kill all the snakes. They have 9% droprate for Oozing bag, which is quite good.<br /><br />Ive got my first Disgusting Oozeling after almost 2hrs of farming (from the 45th bag). Good luck everyone!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mmbrea</b></h3>Got him after 13 kills. I think I just depleted my luck for a year.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PaigeMary</b></h3>With the pre-patch I think blizz nerfed the drop rates on the bags. Just farmed mireglobs in Swamp of Sorrows for an hour and got only 1 bag. Thanks blizz, more pointless nerfs especially during this boring asf pre-patch.</div>
