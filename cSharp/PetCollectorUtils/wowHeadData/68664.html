He's difficult to overcome and not massively weak to anything, except Undead which are rare.\n\nYou have a choice between two main attacks, [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=113]Burn[\/url] and [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=567]Rush[\/url].  Burn will make him strong vs mechanical and weak vs critters, while rush will make him strong vs critters and weak vs flying.  Since he's humanoid, he takes less damage from critters, so Rush makes him particularly effective.  When it comes to his main attack, Rush is generally the better option, so in effect the Corefire Imp is only weak against Flying.  Hilariously, Rush negates Flying's type bonus of increased speed, however.\n\nBoth of his 2nd slot abilities do lasting damage over several rounds.  Because he is Humanoid, he will gain health if either ability hits, which effectively makes these DOTs also HOTs.  As a rare, he has naturally high health, but these DOTs will negate quite a bit of incoming damage, so the Corefire Imp will be much harder to kill off as a result.  Immolation lasts a long time, and can heal up your Imp fairly well if he's forced to retreat.  For instance, if you get Immolation refreshed the turn before running, he'll get I believe 8 heals from it.  8 * 4% = 32% of his total health restored, just while sitting in the back.  Flamethrower is much stronger, but doesn't last long.  Unless you're concerned about the XP, Flamethrower is generally what you'll use if you plan on your Imp fighting to the death (Or kicking so much ass it doesn't have to run!)\n\nI haven't used his 2nd ability in the 3rd slot, Wild Magic.  However, Cauterize seems far too useful to give up unless you have a combo in mind with another pet.  Like many heals, it heals a set amount and then half the last hit taken.  A lot of people try to follow a big hit with a tiny hit, usually if they can adjust speed or otherwise take the first attack the following round.  Rush guarantees you the first attack, however, so they're forced to watch as you Cauterize that 2-turn heavy artillery (Unless your Imp is just faster, you do lose the lead to heal.  Keep that in mind)!  Combined with the constant healing from Immolation\/Flamethrower and the Humanoid bonus, the Imp can last a very, very long time against high incoming damage.  Rush being strong vs critters and critters being weak vs humans, he will absolutely destroy them, but since Rush is only weak vs Flying, he'll remain effective against any other type they throw at you as well.\n\nThe combination of healing, flexibility in the main attack and strategic opportunities given by Rush and Cauterize are what make the Corefire Imp a perfect tank.  Do what you need to to get yours, because once you do he'll become a core part of your team.  His flexibility as a main tank gives you a lot of good options for selecting accompanying pets.  You can carry around more specialized, odd pets for countering the more popular ones that other people will field (For instance, I carry a Peddlefeet to murder Dragonkin).","date":"2012-12-06T10:19:05-06:00","rating":41,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"There's a lot of truth, although there's a second setup you're absolutely missing here: Immolation -> Wild Magic basically guarantees that whatever pet has this combo will die.

I know you're worried about missing Cauterize, but the beauty here is Immolation's 9 rounds of glory healing him up after the swap.

Since I commented on my current \"go-to pet's\" usefulness ([url=\/npc=53884]Feline Familiar[\/url]), I thought it only fitting--since I referenced this pet in its description--to fully explain the usefulness of this pet as well.\r\n\r\nFor PvP:  Like the Feline Familiar, NOT a good choice!  Its close cousin, the [url=\/npc=71033]Fiendish Imp[\/url], is viable primarily for its [url=\/petability=466]Nether Gate[\/url] ability, but don't make the mistake of thinking this pet is equally viable for PvP.  It isn't.  Don't do it.\r\n\r\nIMMOLATION:  This does damage--true--but its primary use is for the DoT\/HoT.  That is, USE THIS FOR THE HEALS (from your Humanoid racial).  Even if your opponent is a critter, you want this up at all times.  If the going gets tough, you can swap your Imp to the back row & still receive heals from this ability.  It's also very useful for [url=\/petability=934]Bubble[\/url] and similar abilities.  Don't look at this as a damaging DoT, look at it as a boost to your heals.  You want this up at all times, front line, back row, doesn't matter.  Again, keep in mind that re-applying this loses your first-strike advantage gained from Rush.  Re-apply before it runs too low, particularly before hitting <50% health against Beasts.  Also be sure to \"waste\" a round re-applying this anytime an opponent flies, goes underground, uses [url=\/petability=315]Spiked Skin[\/url] or the like, uses [url=\/petability=283]Survival[\/url] or similar abilities, etc.  Though keep in mind that--dependent on your opponent's speed--using this may lose you the advantage next round.  Weigh the pros vs. the cons.  Sometimes you need to give up your advantage when your stacks are low.  Sometimes you need to \"waste\" a Rush that won't hit your opponent just to ensure that you'll hit first next round.  Think ahead!\r\n\r\nRUSH:  This isn't simply DPS, this is CONTROL!  You determine wether or not you'll attack first next round, even if you do no damage this round, and no matter how much lower your speed may be than your opponent's.  Few other pets have this much control, so use it wisely.  When coupled with your heal, this gives you absolute control over when you heal.  The worst possible situation is to lose this control (via re-applying Immolation) only to have that followed by a big hit from your opponent.  You want to heal after these big hits, taking maximum advantage of your opponent's DPS.  If you lose the advantage directly after one of these big hits, you may end up \"healing off of\" a smaller hit or DoT, heavily cutting your healing.  Immolation + your racial will give this some buffer, which will usually save you, but it still hurts, and can (rarely) lose you the fight.\r\n\r\nCAUTERIZE:  Your big heal (aside from your racial).  First off, look at your pet.  You should have 1.4k HP.  You want to use this when your HP reaches <1k.  Rush will ensure you the advantage each round, allowing you to use this...  #1: before your opponent hits that round, and...  #2: directly after a particularly damaging attack the previous round, which will maximize the usefulness of Cauterize.  Re-applying Immolation can sometimes lose this control, and it's sometimes necessary.  Allowing your opponent to apply a DoT will nearly always minimize the usefulness of this; [b]Corefire Imp is particularly succeptible to DoTs.[\/b]\r\n\r\nFinally, your [url=\/spell=125801]Heal Battle Pets[\/url] spell will be necessary from time to time.  It has an 8-minute CD, so if you need it more than once in that time (i.e. you need it while it's still on CD) then you're probably using the wrong pets for the area.  In my experience, even [i]abusing[\/i] Corefore Imp + [url=\/npc=54027]Lil' Tarecgosa[\/url] (for fliers) in any area won't outrun your Heal Battle Pets, but there is always the exception.  Maybe you need to trade your Imp for a 2nd flier, or simply find a better area for leveling pets.  The game is huge, and the possibilities--while finite and far from endless--are extremely numerous.\r\n\r\n[url=\/npc=68662]Chrominius[\/url], as mentioned elsewhere, is a great \"poor man's Tarecgosa\" in random battles (far more impacting elsewhere--a must-have, IMO).  If you can't even get that much, [url=\/npc=65321]Wild Crimson Hatchiling[\/url] has both [url=\/petability=115]Breath[\/url] & [url=\/petability=122]Tail Sweep[\/url], dependent on your expected opponent(s)' speed.  The hatchlings are available upon reaching exalted with the [url=\/faction=1271]Order of the Cloud Serpent[\/url], which isn't terribly long or hard.","date":"2014-12-27T02:08:12-06:00","rating":3,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}}];

Its close cousin, the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=71033">Fiendish Imp</a>, is viable primarily for its <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/petability=466">Nether Gate</a> ability, but don't make the mistake of thinking this pet is equally viable for PvP. It isn't. Don't do it.<br /><br />IMMOLATION: This does damage--true--but its primary use is for the DoT/HoT. That is, USE THIS FOR THE HEALS (from your Humanoid racial). Even if your opponent is a critter, you want this up at all times. If the going gets tough, you can swap your Imp to the back row &amp; still receive heals from this ability. It's also very useful for <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/petability=934">Bubble</a> and similar abilities. Don't look at this as a damaging DoT, look at it as a boost to your heals. You want this up at all times, front line, back row, doesn't matter. Again, keep in mind that re-applying this loses your first-strike advantage gained from Rush. Re-apply before it runs too low, particularly before hitting &lt;50% health against Beasts. Also be sure to &quot;waste&quot; a round re-applying this anytime an opponent flies, goes underground, uses <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/petability=315">Spiked Skin</a> or the like, uses <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/petability=283">Survival</a> or similar abilities, etc. Though keep in mind that--dependent on your opponent's speed--using this may lose you the advantage next round. Weigh the pros vs. the cons. Sometimes you need to give up your advantage when your stacks are low. Sometimes you need to &quot;waste&quot; a Rush that won't hit your opponent just to ensure that you'll hit first next round. Think ahead!<br /><br />RUSH: This isn't simply DPS, this is CONTROL! You determine wether or not you'll attack first next round, even if you do no damage this round, and no matter how much lower your speed may be than your opponent's. Few other pets have this much control, so use it wisely. When coupled with your heal, this gives you absolute control over when you heal. The worst possible situation is to lose this control (via re-applying Immolation) only to have that followed by a big hit from your opponent. You want to heal after these big hits, taking maximum advantage of your opponent's DPS. If you lose the advantage directly after one of these big hits, you may end up &quot;healing off of&quot; a smaller hit or DoT, heavily cutting your healing. Immolation + your racial will give this some buffer, which will usually save you, but it still hurts, and can (rarely) lose you the fight.<br /><br />CAUTERIZE: Your big heal (aside from your racial). First off, look at your pet. You should have 1.4k HP. You want to use this when your HP reaches &lt;1k. Rush will ensure you the advantage each round, allowing you to use this... #1: before your opponent hits that round, and... #2: directly after a particularly damaging attack the previous round, which will maximize the usefulness of Cauterize. Re-applying Immolation can sometimes lose this control, and it's sometimes necessary. Allowing your opponent to apply a DoT will nearly always minimize the usefulness of this; <b>Corefire Imp is particularly succeptible to DoTs.</b><br /><br />Finally, your <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=125801">Heal Battle Pets</a> spell will be necessary from time to time. It has an 8-minute CD, so if you need it more than once in that time (i.e. you need it while it's still on CD) then you're probably using the wrong pets for the area. In my experience, even <i>abusing</i> Corefore Imp + <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=54027">Lil' Tarecgosa</a> (for fliers) in any area won't outrun your Heal Battle Pets, but there is always the exception. Maybe you need to trade your Imp for a 2nd flier, or simply find a better area for leveling pets. The game is huge, and the possibilities--while finite and far from endless--are extremely numerous.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=68662">Chrominius</a>, as mentioned elsewhere, is a great &quot;poor man's Tarecgosa&quot; in random battles (far more impacting elsewhere--a must-have, IMO). If you can't even get that much, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=65321">Wild Crimson Hatchiling</a> has both <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/petability=115">Breath</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/petability=122">Tail Sweep</a>, dependent on your expected opponent(s)' speed. The hatchlings are available upon reaching exalted with the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/faction=1271">Order of the Cloud Serpent</a>, which isn't terribly long or hard.</div>

    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>So, what are you waiting for? <a href="/client">Download the client</a> and get started.&nbsp;</p>
