From the defensive side of things, lacking the DoT reduction of the ever-popular crab family is a little dissapointing, but he has an excellent moveset that enables him to outlast and kill a large field of opponents.

Tranquility or Emerald Dream can be used at your discretion; Tranquility will allow you to keep more offensive pressure up by not sacrificing as many turns. However, if you can support the whelp with another pet with either moonlight or sunlight, you can crank his defensive power up tremendously by running Emerald Presence instead of Moonfire, which will make him into more of a true wall.\r\n\r\nIn short it takes a lot to kill this thing and it can put the hurt on a lot of switch-ins.","date":"2014-01-26T12:23:45-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":8,"id":1975106,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"QuantumChaos","body":"These Battle Pets are dropped as loot from [b]Noxious Whelps[u][\/u][\/b], ( [npc=39384] ) in [b]Feralas[u][\/u][\/b], ( [zone=357] ), North of Alliance flight path, Dreamer's Rest.

I got quite a few greens and because I wanted to keep a tally I ended up throwing out a few on the way. Oh well. I got some 21g from the whelps themselves anyway.<br />Good help: a flying mount to use over spaces of water. Makes for quick, easy merry-go-round farming and spares you trying to avoid the drakes on the middle isle.<br /><br />Hope it helps!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Karoxen</b></h3>This whelpling is a very solid battle pet. From the defensive side of things, lacking the DoT reduction of the ever-popular crab family is a little dissapointing, but he has an excellent moveset that enables him to outlast and kill a large field of opponents. His dragon-typing giving him the ever-powerful execute gives him tremendous wallbreaking power if Moonlight is buffing his emerald bite, ensuring that he's fairly likely to come out on top if against another defensive pet. Tranquility or Emerald Dream can be used at your discretion; Tranquility will allow you to keep more offensive pressure up by not sacrificing as many turns. However, if you can support the whelp with another pet with either moonlight or sunlight, you can crank his defensive power up tremendously by running Emerald Presence instead of Moonfire, which will make him into more of a true wall.<br /><br />In short it takes a lot to kill this thing and it can put the hurt on a lot of switch-ins.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>QuantumChaos</b></h3>These Battle Pets are dropped as loot from <b>Noxious Whelps<u></b>, ( <a href="/npc=39384/noxious-whelp">Noxious Whelp</a> ) in <b>Feralas<u></u></b>, ( <a href="/zone=357/feralas">Feralas</a> ), North of Alliance flight path, Dreamer's Rest. The Noxious Whelps spawn around the bank of the lake, with suggested spawn points being near the south-western bank and north-eastern bank, surrounding the Dream Bough island.<br />I just got my <b>Rare Emerald Whelpling </u></b>this morning, 6-26-14, at 7:30am server time, on Norgannon. He dropped after only 30-45 minutes of farming, from a Noxious Whelp that I killed on the very nothern most bank (directly north of Alliance flight path, north of the Dream Bough island). I was surprised that he dropped from a Whelp that far north, since map doesn't that area as a spawn point. <br /><br />Total number of kills, calculated from Tiny Fangs and Dragon Femur's in my bag = 88. <br /><br />My advice, while I believe you should focus on the listed spawn points, do not just exclude other areas. The Noxious Whelps spawn all around the banks of the lake, and so if you have finished killing the Whelps in the focus areas, do a fly-through of the rest of the bank and kill the rest. It won't hurt anything, and might, like it did with me, surprise you with your Emerald Whelpling. : )</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>strangeclouds</b></h3>Had to make an account to say this..<br /><br />Farmed for 4 hours the other day, probably 200 kills or so. I got bored and went to do something else. Came back about a week later flying through to do something else and thought why not kill a couple. 2 kills in it dropped a rare :) I'm happy now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Delthius</b></h3>This pet can also be found as a drop in the extra loot bags tanks get at times. Tanked three LFR's tonight and got one to drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1450134</b></h3>Made an account just to post this.<br />Came here expecting a super long farm time and a few days worth of time in.<br />I KILLED THREE AND GOT ONE.<br />WOOOOO</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lyta</b></h3>It took me about 50 kills and less than hour which also included leather skinning and herb gathering. Got it! So happy as I was sure it would take much longer. Have farmed another whelp and never did get one. Yeehaw. Do follow advice previously and follow around no matter where guides say they are in a string along banks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>linth</b></h3>Killed ~850 of these today (counting Tiny Fangs and Dragon Femurs). I got 1 Sprite Darter Egg, 1 Emerald Whelpling, 1 Distress Beacon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>FRICKINGLUNATIC</b></h3>dropped for me after 415 kills.<br />gets really tiresome, don't give up</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Badkitty1176</b></h3>Just grinded this out. 288 kills, 45mins. Got one. They're still dropping. Just keep at it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Scarrz0</b></h3>been going at these for a week now 8 hours or more a day..i keep falling sleep farming for the drop.<br />Nothing yet..5 to 6 thousand or more killed now.<br />going to continue for another week, if i do not get a drop? could they have lowered the drop rate?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MZGrey</b></h3>I'm farming today. So far, about 150 kills in, gotten a distress beacon. I'm gonna keep trying, just like with the Guldrak Hatchling. I am two battle pets away from my Zookeeper achievement, which I started on one month ago. As a side bonus I'm knocking my explorations out the window too. Today, I'm doing this just to have an extra dragonkin- not even part of any achievement. Do what makes ya happy, and remember it's a game :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Radon86</b></h3>Farmed 1200 Noxious Whelps today, not a single pet dropped.<br />To be continued tomorrow...</div>

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>So, what are you waiting for? <a href="/client">Download the client</a> and get started.&nbsp;</p>
