<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>919056</b></h3>There seems to be a phasing issue at the Dragonmaw Gates/Pass. If i zone into Westfall (Dragonmaw Gate) and let the fires fade out, then fly into Twilight Highlands, I zone into Twilight Highlands and a Highlands Mouse appears, then I quickly phase into the completed Dragonmaw Pass quest-line and the mouse disappears. <br /><br />I think I'm going to blame my lack of Highlands Mouse spawns on this phasing issue. <s>Maybe someone who hasn't completed that chain can run over there and see if the mice appear for them? </s><br /><br />I seem to have a similar problem outside the Ruins of the Scarlet Enclave in EPL. I see 4 or so battle pets outside the ruins, but when I get close enough to engage them I zone into the ruins and the pets phase out.<br /><br />Update: I went and found the mouse on my level 76 hunter. It was right where my 85 was able to briefly see it, and I battled it and caught it. I then flew around Dragonmaw Pass and found a few more. <b> It appears that the best way to catch this pet is to use a toon that has NOT completed the quest chain in Dragonmaw Pass that begins with <a href="/quest=28103/easy-pickings">Easy Pickings</a> </b> I'm not certain which quest in the chain phases the mice out, but upon chain completion you can kiss your Dragonmaw Pass mice goodbye.<br /><br />Edit: Spelling/Verbage</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DrCheis</b></h3>I don't think this pet is actually found in Wetlands. It's probably just spillover from the adjacent Twilight Highlands spawns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Organthrone</b></h3>Well, I was flying around Dragonmaw Pass and came up with nothing. Haven't even covered the quest chain on my main. One popped up, but it was inside a cave, and it took me a few seconds to realise: it was in the back of The Gullet. Just one, nothing else. I'm presuming that was a spawning bug, unless anyone else has found one in there. If you're Horde, keep your eyes on that place. <br /><br />Grabbed it, uncommon, happy with that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sopor30</b></h3>I found that the phasing issues were due to characters not having progressed the quests in the Twilight Highlands enough. I could see the highlands mouse from outside of Dunwald Ruins, but upon getting above the ruins everything would zone out (including the mouse). So I logged on another character that I knew had completed the quests there, and he was able to see the mouse and there was no zoning out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aliandrin</b></h3>You want the 100% speed breed.<br /><br />Unfortunately this guy comes in more breeds than poodles. If you really want a speedy one to use it, go look for a regular Mouse. The regular Mouse only has three breeds and one of them is the beneficial one.<br /><br />(Unless you just like him because of the nifty pokedex entry about him being violent.)<br /><br />Protip: Looking for a particular breed in a particular colour? Look until you get a secondary Highlands Mouse. Finally find your rare in speed breed but he's tan? Oh well? Sad face? Nope! You have a choice! Forfeit, battle the same pokemon again, and the secondaries will pick their colours again. They'll be the same breeds and qualities, but they will re-choose their skin colours. So just forfeit and reset your secondary Highlands Mouse 'til he's white.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lovestorybro</b></h3>Like a lot of other people are saying, the best way to get this pet is probably to fight other pets until you get a mouse as the secondary pet. There is a problem with not being able to see the ones on the ground that are spawned with some phasing issue. I got mine by making a macro to target the mouse in the phased zone and then another key that is bound to interact with your target. I found a mouse by the Alliance town Victor's Point and then swooped down and smacked my keys to get into the pet battle before he could phase out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1367794</b></h3>For better results trying to get the highland mouse, stick near habituated areas with populace from either horde or alliance, they spawn more as secondary there, or where other critters spawn.. I got 2 of my rares from the ogre area</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Random0182</b></h3>Found Highlands Mouse in cave, just take flight path to &quot;The Gullet, Twilight Highlands&quot;<br />Here are the coordinates 34.19, 36.74</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mertarus</b></h3>Captured one today at Blackbear Outpost, Stormheim. Appeared as a side pet while fighting with Slithering Brownscale.<br /><br />Edit: Confirmed that they also spawn as the main battle pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>eKatherine</b></h3>The mouth of the cave I found one in is at 37:33. I couldn't battle it because it was hanging out in an obstructed area, but the cockroach nearby spawned a highland mouse as a secondary.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Grammie</b></h3>22.83/20.23...4:48 pm EST/2:48 pm server time...perhaps it's just me but I had a hard time finding this one...the map listed on this page looks nothing like the map on my game...I went to the only cave I could find - top left hand corner...several were running around</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Elveira</b></h3>The cave at Glopgut's Hollow is full of Highland Mice. plenty to see on the viewer (36,33)</div>
