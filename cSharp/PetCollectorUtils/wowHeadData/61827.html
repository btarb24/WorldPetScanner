<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>457933</b></h3>If you are looking for this one on Bloodmyst, just fight every capturable pet you see, as an Infected Fawn may add to any battle. <s>If you don't get one to add, just bail the battle and try again. </s><br /><br />Tried this strategy when I got bored with running about looking for fawn spawn and got my fawn as an add three fights later. <br /><br />It was poor quality, but I don't personally care, gotta catch 'em all! (#277)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>missbanjo</b></h3>I've only come across one rare and it was a secondary in a wild battle. Unfortunately one of my BPs has a nasty DoT and I killed it. I'm sure it'll be a friggin week before I find another.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>752995</b></h3>Captured in Eastern Plaguelands <br />Quality: Rare<br />Level: 12<br />Health: 794<br />Power: 139<br />Speed: 123<br /><br />In PvP Battle Pets the Infected Fawn has a naturally high speed, but with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=162">Adrenaline Rush</a> on it will go first every round. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=360">Flurry</a> hits pretty hard (with bonus when going first) but will absolutely decimate an Undead quickly. Add in the self healing it gets back from its DOT <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=212">Siphon Life</a> and it's a pretty well rounded contender.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DrCheis</b></h3>Very unlikely you'll encounter this pet in Siverpine, but if you happen to do battle with a pet in that zone that is level 5, there's a good chance this guy will accompany him.<br /><br />5.1 Update: I've confirmed this pet can now spawn on his own, but he seems much more rare than the others. Only found one while crossing the zone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1036751</b></h3>I saw 3 of these on Bloodymyst Isle over around Axxarien.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>981951</b></h3>I don't know if this was confirmed or not on this thread, but i found a level 5 infected fawn in Silverpine.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sugarshockdoll</b></h3>Just caught a Common quality, level 3, Infected Fawn in Silverpine - just west of Ambermill.<br />Was not a secondary, he was walking around.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>warmgeoff</b></h3>Foxfingers, I gotta tell you that I am relieved to find that getting a rare Infected Fawn is at least *possible*...been grinding away on these in EPL seems like hours--but no rare ;(<br />The Infected Squirrel also seems very elusive in rare quality. Is anyone/everyone else having extraordinarily bad luck with these rates? <br />Tell me I'm not crazy; Had to lookup here to see mention of a rare...<br />GL out there<br />warmgeoff</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1051758</b></h3>If you REALLY (really really) want this pet asap . then good head and try to ctach it at bloodmyst but its not worth it . they are pretty common(rares)once you get to eastern plaguelands</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rayanna</b></h3>I found Infected Fawn as both a primary and secondary wild battle pet on Bloodmyst Isle. I also found Infected Squirrel as both a primary and a secondary wild battle pet. Both can occur as a secondary pet to Ravager Hatchling and they all range in level from 4-6.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1062573</b></h3>Let me start by saying that this is a fairly unpleasant pet to farm a rare of no matter how you do it. After trying some different methods, I found Eastern Plaguelands to be the best place to farm rares of these. However, they aren't exceptionally common primary spawns here; pull as many pets as you can and try to get them as secondaries. You'll probably only get these something like 1 in 6 or so, but pets are SO common in the zone that you can pull a lot fast. Also, of course, in the process, you'll find some primaries along the way, so that helps. The primaries seem to be a little more common to the north than the south; I'm not sure why or if this is just a coincidence, but I was definitely noticing this trend as I farmed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Winning117</b></h3>After going through 41 of these I finally encountered a rare. Definitely one of the hardest rare-quality companions to obtain via pet battles!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>thebl4ckd0g</b></h3>have killed probably around 100 of these this weekend so far in EPL, but highest quality I've seen is green quality. I'm leveling a bunch of pets from 10 to 14 though, so hopefully I'll get one eventually. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bomigabster</b></h3>Found a whole bunch of these as primary and secondary battle pets around Plaguewood/Plaguewood tower, as well as south Zul'Mashar between Northpass Tower and Northdale along with a few <a href="/npc=61830/festering-maggot">Festering Maggot</a>, including two rare maggots.</div>
