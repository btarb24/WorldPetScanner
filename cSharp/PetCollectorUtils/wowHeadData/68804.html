So you should probably use a battle stone if you want to invest in this particular companion.[\/li]\r\n[li] [b]All [npc=68804] are [i]lvl3 [\/i]or [i]lvl4[\/i][\/b], nothing higher or lower. [\/li]\r\n[li]I [b]recommend [i]searching late[\/i] on your realm[\/b]. I did it around 11pm at night, you will likely not have to go this late but it did mean I could walk around for as long as I wished to and I didn't have to contest anyone for a spawn.[\/li]\r\n[li]As previously mentioned, the [npc=68804]s [b]spawn in [i]batches[\/i] with [i]sporadic individual[\/i] spawns[\/b] in between the main spawn groups. [\/li]\r\n[li] Killing the surrounding [npc=3276]s, [npc=3280]s, [npc=3278]s and even [npc=3452] or [npc=5830] [b][i]does not affect spawn rates[\/i][\/b] of [npc=68804] [\/li]\r\n[li] One side note is that the area has quite the pleasing atmosphere, a high level character can take a comfortable stroll and enjoy the view while waiting for your new feathered companion!\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonally I find most of the flying types lacking, the majority are fairly plain clones of each other such as several types of moths, gulls and owls.

I flew around low to the ground and killed all critters that had harpies around them. I noticed that by doing that I was getting 1-2 per round to spawn. I think the critters are place holders.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zharon</b></h3>I flew by this area around 5:15 AM EST/server time. I saw 5 of these up. I immediately tamed the first I battled with, an uncommon. I decided to look to see if any of the others were rare. I tried it with two others, but they were common and poor. I logged out and logging back in to prevent it from de-spawning.<br /><br />I then noticed something odd. They ALL de-spawned anyways, even the ones I did not touch. <br /><br />Either there was a rogue fighting in stealth during the pet battles, or this new pet (and possibly some others) may be hard to find due to the fact that they spawn and then can de-spawn on their own, adding to the rarity/scarcity.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1012488</b></h3>It took two nights of camping the Dry Hills to finally get a rare version. Competition for these beautiful pets is fierce right now, so be prepared to have to wait a while. The area is also shared with adders and prairie dogs - I passed the time battling those in hopes the harpy would show up faster as well as to level my lowbie pets. There seems to be no particular place they spawn - I saw them all over the Dry Hills area... Went through several poor, common and uncommon varieties before finally getting a rare. BTW the new pet battle feature allowing us to see the quality of a pet during the battle is a real time-saver: I can decide during the battle if I want to try to capture or simply kill the pet outright. Unfortunately for other players in the area: forfeiting the match or logging out of the battle no longer &quot;saves&quot; the pet for someone else to battle - it disappears anyway. Just have patience: fly low watch your map and make sure the pet you choose to fight with isn't too powerful so you don't kill your wonderful new pet!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>opalexian</b></h3>I was in Dry Hills yesterday in midday on Twisting Nether (3ish EST) and found the hills full of them (was actually there herbing but became fixated when I found the harplings X D )<br /><br />I battled about 10 of them, and of those I got-<br /><br />-3 uncommons<br />-3 commons<br />-4 greys<br /><br />I think there is likely a placebo effect, spawns being affected by CRZs (ie you get stuck with however many there are in that netherworld you end up in and competing with whoever else is there with you), and dumb luck.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>978272</b></h3><b>This battle pet is located in the North West portion of Northern Barrens. In other comments it suggests that you kill other creatures to allow the spawn of this pets. That is incorrect.<br /><br />Like other pets, these ones are on a special type of spawn basis. They spawn over time regardless of other spawns that are located in the area. How ever, if u start just killing the harpy adds located in the area, the pets will absolutely not spawn.<br /><br />Think of it like this. The parents need to lay the eggs and hatch them before you can catch them. The other pets that I have noticed on the same spawn basis as the harpies are the mechanical pets, such as Robochic</b></div>

After two entire evenings of battle though, I've yet to see a rare one. Plenty of uncommon and common, but no rare. If they're out there, they're avoiding me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1012488</b></h3>So far all the comments including my own have been about finding or capturing this pet. About the pet herself: she is an awesome fighter. I've put her at the top of my highest level lineup as my &quot;tank&quot; pet due to her hard hits and debuffs she puts on the opposition. Moreover she regenerates a tiny bit of HP between rounds - making her pretty tough to beat. Yes she's a rare (my search for which got me downrated earlier by a couple of well-meaning but rather ignorant players!) so she has been totally worth the trouble. And thanx to Aanutahti and Amberlynn for the supporting comments!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kyzuko</b></h3>I was in the area around 5pm realm time.<br /><br />I encountered about:<br /><br />7 Poor<br />3-4 Common<br />2 Uncommon<br />before coming across a rare which I claimed<br />And left the about 10 plus others alone.<br /><br />In the process, I leveled a level one pet to five from the battles.<br /><br />***I dd not have to kill any other critters for them to spawn, they were already there.<br />The most were by the blue harpy with the exclamation mark beside her frame.***</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>304166</b></h3>I flew around the Dry Hills for an hour and a half. I saw one, a Common, which I accidentally killed while trying to capture it, because all my pets were too high and would one-shot it to death. I noticed during that time that there were next to no Battle Pets at all in the area...until I started killing all the Battle Pets further out, to the south and east. When I did that, the number of Battle Pets that spawned within the Dry Hills increased dramatically, and eventually one of them was a Harpy Youngling, although a Poor quality one, sadly.<br /><br />If I had to wager a guess, it appears that killing Battle Pets in the zone, or at least nearby the Dry Hills, increases the spawn rate within the Dry Hills, and thus also the spawn rate of the Harpy Younglings. My observation, anyway.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wowcataryn</b></h3>I found that killing every critter in the area along with a fair amount of the actual harpys, then going out ranging and killing any battle-pets I find seemed to increase the spawns somewhat.<br /><br />I'm thinking that they are tied to the critters in the area as well as the battle-pets in the zone. Thinning the harpys gives a spot for a possible spawn. I was getting 1-2 spawns every 10 minutes or so using this method...could have been more as there were 2 others in the area trying to farm these up, so they may have gotten a spawn here or there. Unfortunately, no rares yet, tho I had the opportunity to capture quite a few greens.<br /><br />I tried a couple different methods...killed all the harpys...killed all the critters...killed battle-pets all over the zone. Killing the critters and battle-pets seemed to cause spawns, but not younglings. Killing the harpys seemed to increase the number of youngling spawns considerably (up to 1-2 every 10'ish minutes from 0), however, killing just harpys didn't do anything unless other ppl were getting the spawns before I saw them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dsiacono</b></h3>they're very sneaky, indeed. i started slaying all the adders &amp; prairie dogs that were in the dry hills but no harpy younglings....until i went into a far NW corner of the area. i found an uncommon at coordinates: . hopefully this should help anyone. i guess they don't let their harpy yougling play in plain sight. anyway, happy hunting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kaushik</b></h3>Maybe the notes are outdated, since I am writing at patch 5.1. But Harpy younglings are on a regular spawn timer.<br /><br />I do believe killing critters and other battle pets helps in spawning replacement npcs and one of them might be the battle pet you are looking for.<br /><br />However, my strategy was to fight the 2-3 harpie younglings that spawned, then fly off and look for cheetah cubs then come back to a fresh batch of 2-3.<br /><br /><b>The reason I make the point that killing other critters and battle pets may help harpy younglings spawn, is because the spawn locations are fixed. Some times there would be an adder or a prairie dog or (if lucky) a harpy youngling in that particular spot.</b><br /><br />I would guess the spawn timer is around 15 minutes. Spawns do occur, but its a pita to find a blue, which I finally did (after finding 3 blue cheetah cubs - one of which my pet Chrominus killed, but captured the other 2).<br /><br />So its not a hard pet to get.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JumperBaltzer</b></h3>I went to the coordinates I was told to from here (Upper Left side of Northern Barrens), and the 1st one I ran across was a level 3 rare, I was lucky I guess...<br />I was with my Girlfriend on her toon and after she went through all the rest that were there(about 25), and didn't find a Rare, we went to get a Giraffe Calf and when we returned to see if they had respawned, there was none to be found, our Giraffe hunt only took maybe 30 minutes, so I can only say that the respawn rate of the Harpy's has to be longer than 30 minutes...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lovestorybro</b></h3>The best honest advice I can give if you are looking to get a rare version of this is use the account wide benefits. Sure you can try to 'push the spawn' or whatever by killing mobs/common battle pets/critters around the area and feel like you're doing something, but this was not working for me. I used a random alt from a low population server (horde side is quicker because Org is right next to the norther barrens) to get one of these. It took me pretty much an entire field of these before getting a rare, but I was able to get one. The point is, there actually was an entire field of them to try, not just 1 every 20 minutes. Other methods just did not work for me, and my main server gets camped heavily in that area. Wasted probably a good 2 to 3 hours trying the top rated comments methods of killing other things and trying various ways to get the spawn to happen, but it just does not work. I personally already had a high level alt on that server but if I didn't I would have taken the time to level up a toon because your chances are much much better.<br /><br />Using this method, I didn't have to worry that I was ruining it for anyone else trying to catch one by going through them all.<br /><br />Take advantage of the fact that you can use other servers!</div>

Her stats will always be balanced, which means that she's unlikely to have the speed to get the most out of Quills -- use slicing wind instead. Flyby is a nice plus, as is the fact she eventually gets Lift-Off. Of special note is the move Counterstrike. As I mentioned, she's not likely to be faster than her opponent, which means Counterstrike will probably get its extra damage.</div>

It breaks my heart I had to genocide them to oblivion just to find a rare quality one.<br /><br />Edit: I remembered I had a rare quality stone on an alt so I used it on the harpy to save time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wannabeabear</b></h3>Killed mobs around and battled all the battle able pets and nothing. After waiting about half an hour finally one popped up clicked to battle and was a rare right off the bat. While flying to leave I found another one, but don't really know if killing/battling really did anything or not so the best advice is to be diligent or wait till slow server time to try and get one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Silvansaria</b></h3>When I arrived there was no battle pets (save for 2 Prairie Dogs). So I promptly started killing anything I saw in the area (and let my pet kill the battle pets). Harpy Younglings started appearing so I captured the first one I saw just in case which was unfortunately low quality (I can always upgrade it later to rare if need be).<br /><br />I'll keep clearing the area and see what happens...<br /><br />EDIT: Another one spawned - Uncommon this time... Clearing the area definitely works to spawn them...<br /><br />EDIT: Found a rare one - the third one that appeared.<br /><br />So basically:<br /><br />Arrived and started clearing everything (Harpies, battle Pets, Critters). The whole process took about 30 minutes and during that time 3 appeared.<br /><br />1 poor.<br />1 uncommon.<br />1 rare.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cadred</b></h3>I have no luck. I have an average roll of 11 across all my many toons. But I got a green Harpy today and feel very blessed. I'll just wait for a flawless to make her my blue Harpy. <br /><br />I have loved the design of the harpies ever since I ran my very first toon in wow and saw these brilliantly designed mobs.... Their design is incredible. To make a bird mob emulate a Vegas showgirl is simply inspired. Hats off to Blizz for this. Now I have one in my kit.<br /><br />Treechunk, I appreciated your comments about just killing stuff to pass the time. After spending countless hours waiting for pets and hating every minute of it, you helped me to feel good about it. :) Thank you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>geekygirlish</b></h3>I got this little missus by dumb luck when I first started pet battling, long after it has been initiated, I just couldn't be bothered. She was one of the first I captured because I came across her leveling a pet and thought &quot;CUTE!&quot; Ignorant of the fact she was rare, just grabbed her and have been pretty much using her ever since. She is my first 25 lvld.<br /><br />No one has mentioned she is a strange hybrid, humanoid, but with the strengths you find in flying skills. Her second tier are opposite strengths of strong and weak against dragonkin with counterstrike. Humanoids are supposed to be strong against dragonkins but not this lady. She wipes the floor with aquatics. And she is an awesome little pet for most battles.<br /><br />Main comment, in a hurry to set up a lineup to defeat a dragonkin, don't make my rookie error of thinking &quot;oh, humanoids, strong against dragonkins!&quot; and stick her in the lineup. She'll go down in flames.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>WCrispy</b></h3>There only seemed to be 3-4 battle pet spawns in the entire Dry Hills, with maybe 1-2 up at once. I took the opportunity to catch some rare blue adders and prairie dogs, and then after I killed the battle pets as they spawned until a Harpy Youngling showed up. I didn't touch the mobs or regular critters. I don't know if this helped and I don't know if the spawns are shared but it can't hurt to try. I ended up getting just a crappy common one, so if you're after a rare blue one you're going to need to take some time.<br /><br />**EDIT** No sooner than when I typed the last line I go to leave the area and see another youngling so I decided 'why not' and got a rare one. Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sweetieheart</b></h3>I had quite a few battles spawned when I got to Dry Hills on a Sunday afternoon. Most were harpies and adders. Be careful to have a little weaker pet in your line up, as I killed 2 rares in 2 hits with pets the same level by mistake. Finally after about the first 50% was down, I'd swap to a level 1 turnip I keep around and slowly beat her hit points down. Took about 30 minutes to finally get a rare without goofing it up. Happy Hunting :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Coursie</b></h3>I went to check to see if there were any harpy younglings today.

If it's empty, try again the next day. Found nothing for four days then on the fifth found loads of them. I suspect they have a long spawn timer and whenever any are found the area is cleared which is why you'll often find the place empty.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1443913</b></h3>With how rare this is to appear it should just appear as a rare the first time you fight it, that way its over and done with trying to capture it as a rare, and not spend an hour or more trying to get one.<br /><br />edit: still trying and the only thing making it not too bad is that I need a rare adder as well. as for trying to capture low lvl pets, if you got the Molten Corgi use that if its a higher lvl. its 2nd ability (Superbark) will always drop the other pet down to 1hp, making it very useful capturing low pets if you don't feel like using same lvl pets or you don't have any.<br /><br />edit: got my rare adder... not sure if I wanna continue to try and look for a rare one of these. may just take the uncommon one I captured on first try and wait until I get the item to upgrade it to rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PolymorphedLoli</b></h3>A few things I discovered while looking for my own little Harpy friend!<br /><br /><b>Any quality above <i>poor</i> and <i>common </i>are quite rare</b> (Also a little selfish to take all the spawns, however as I was completely alone I felt it fine to have a general look into rarity spawns), out of around 15 <a href="/npc=68804/harpy-youngling">Harpy Youngling</a>s that I fought, most were poor, around four were common and just two were uncommon. So you should probably use a battle stone if you want to invest in this particular companion.<br /> <b>All <a href="/npc=68804/harpy-youngling">Harpy Youngling</a> are <i>lvl3 </i>or <i>lvl4</i></b>, nothing higher or lower. <br />I <b>recommend <i>searching late</i> on your realm</b>. I did it around 11pm at night, you will likely not have to go this late but it did mean I could walk around for as long as I wished to and I didn't have to contest anyone for a spawn.<br />As previously mentioned, the <a href="/npc=68804/harpy-youngling">Harpy Youngling</a>s <b>spawn in <i>batches</i> with <i>sporadic individual</i> spawns</b> in between the main spawn groups. <br /> Killing the surrounding <a href="/npc=3276/witchwing-harpy">Witchwing Harpy</a>s, <a href="/npc=3280/witchwing-windcaller">Witchwing Windcaller</a>s, <a href="/npc=3278/witchwing-slayer">Witchwing Slayer</a>s and even <a href="/npc=3452/serena-bloodfeather">Serena Bloodfeather</a> or <a href="/npc=5830/sister-rathtalon">Sister Rathtalon</a> <b><i>does not affect spawn rates</i></b> of <a href="/npc=68804/harpy-youngling">Harpy Youngling</a> <br /> One side note is that the area has quite the pleasing atmosphere, a high level character can take a comfortable stroll and enjoy the view while waiting for your new feathered companion!<br /><br />Personally I find most of the flying types lacking, the majority are fairly plain clones of each other such as several types of moths, gulls and owls. While the <a href="/npc=68804/harpy-youngling">Harpy Youngling</a> is not a flying type, I use it as one as it has a good set of flying moves along with the humanoid passive which makes her an extremely effective tank (I know she doesn't look like one, but she sure is great at it). With almost her entire move set comprising of flying types she is especially good against strong aquatic types with beast moves such as a <a href="/npc=63060/softshell-snapling">Softshell Snapling</a> or <a href="/npc=63841/golden-civet">Golden Civet</a>.<br /><br />Good luck all of you!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rphalange</b></h3>Last time I checked for these guys there was absolutely nothing around but snakes and other critters. Today, Saturday, 6:30am realm time, there were about two dozen of them. I had my pick of the litter so to speak, found 2 blues and a green. So many whites/greys. There are only two breeds, &quot;dice&quot; and &quot;heart&quot;, and I ended up with two blue hearts and a white dice. Tried to find another blue dice but... no dice. heh.<br /><br />In any case, I got lucky this time and they were just there. No waiting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Eepomg420</b></h3>I would like to say I am almost certain they spawn late hours into the early AM like 2 or so. I came by one morning around 5 PST there was nothing, killed all the critters and none spawned. Came back the next night at 12:45 PST and boom. Harpies EVERYWHERE. For days. 4th one was a rare for me got lucky. If you wanna hunt one of these if you can I'd say go around 10 pm - 1 am, seems the best spawn times.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jnorbut</b></h3>Like others have said.....try early in the morning.<br />i parked one of my alts at this location on a friday evening checking every two hours or so<br /><br />6 p.m. central time (4 p.m. realm time) nothing<br />8 p.m. central time (6 p.m. realm time) nothing<br />10 p.m central time (8 p.m. realm time) nothing<br />12 a.m. central time (10 p.m. realm time) nothing<br /><br />went to sleep<br /><br />checked again at 5 a.m. the next day (3 a.m. realm time) nothing<br />checked again at 7 a.m. central time (5 a.m. realm time) and bingo....there were literally dozens of them.<br />and they seemed to regenerate quickly too....for a while.<br />then all of a sudden they stopped regenerating around 7:30 a.m. .central time (5:30 a.m. realm time)<br /><br />got my rare on about the 10th battle.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gladly</b></h3>Caught the only spawn present in the Dry Hills area, at 25.98, 28.03 in Northern Barrens, at 7:58pm EST/server time. I did not farm any critters or mobs as I was lucky and this one spawn was Rare quality. (Four more spawned in on their own as I was typing this comment.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Uroshnor</b></h3>Just to add to the spawning/rarity info, I checked out the Dry Hills area at 11:30 p.m. and the little harpies were everywhere. Found a rare on the second try, though after that I did another dozen battles looking for a rare of a different breed and never saw another nor even an uncommon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aceofblue</b></h3>These are either much less rare than they used to be, or I came at an optimal time. Started in the Dry Hills at 11am server (noon EST) and they were everywhere. They were respawning faster than I could complete a loop of the area. Lots of variety in rarities for both breeds; saw two rare B/B's but did not manage to find a rare H/B. <br /><br />However, I noticed at almost exactly 12:30 EST the respawn rate had dramatically decreased. This would seem to agree with what other posters have said about AM spawn times.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Archanos</b></h3>IS THIS EVEN LEGAL!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thyra</b></h3>Seems like the spawn of the Harpy Younglings has something to do with the server time. On my first attempt in the evening no harpy was up as a battle pet. I did as some people suggested in the comments, killed all critters, killed the harpys (the mobs in the area), flew 1 million loops in that area - nothing. Came back the next evening, still nothing.<br />Third attempt was at 2am server time, whole area full of harpy battle pets. Checked again for fun around 11am and 12:15 noon, still the same. Next check at 3 pm and they were gone.<br /><br />I assume that they either spawn at 1 or 2 am server time and despawn at 1 or 2 pm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Moin</b></h3>Harpy Younglings everywhere on the Dry Hills today (00:45 UTC).</div>
