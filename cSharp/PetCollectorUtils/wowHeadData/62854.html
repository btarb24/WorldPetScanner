To report a bug to our QA team, all you need to do is click on the red question mark on your bottom menu bar, then find the \"Submit Bug\" button (with a picture of a little blue bug next to it). This button will bring you to a text window where you can describe exactly what was going on when this happened.

I made it home just in time. The servers came up 5 min. after I got home. I had logged in and was watching the realm list for mine to come up. When they did I logged into my alt. parked at the tournament grounds in Icecrown (for the pet daily). There were a bunch of the whelps up of course. Myself and a few others cleared them out but no rares to be found.\n\nI got off work the next day and tried a theory I had. I went straight to my alt. in Icecrown and waited a few minutes to see if any whelps would spawn. Right at the time the servers went up the prior day the whelps spawned. They came in small batches over the course of 10-15 minutes. At least a dozen total I'd say.\n\nI made sure to be home at the same time for the next 2 days and experienced the same thing each day. Respawns 24 hours later in small waves over the course of 10-15 min.\n\nFinally, yesterday, I snagged a rare. Very exciting. Only 4 more pets that can be upgraded to rare from pet battles to go!\n\nMoral of the story is that if you can find out the exact time that the servers reset each week you can be ready for respawns of this rare pet.\n[url=http:\/\/us.battle.net\/wow\/en\/forum\/topic\/7178647829]Confirmed Scourged Whelpling Spawn Timer - Forums - World of Warcraft[\/url][\/quote]\n[i][b]Update:[\/b] This seems to be working! ;)[\/i] [url=npc=62854#comments:id=1765761]goldash[\/url] quoted this post and posted â†“thisâ†“ under it 30 hours after my original post! :)[quote goldash]Tested 24hours after a reset and there were respawns 4am servers must have come up the day before after a restart and 4am the respawns began, seemed to be for about 15minutes.

Fair to note: Even if the server came up at EXACTLY 11am PST it's worth it to be there earlier. In my case, they began spawning around 10:30. Better early and waiting for spawns than late and having no spawns.[\/quote]\n\n[b][u]Newest Spawn Timer Info[\/u][\/b]\nThere are two types of restarts: Server Restarts and Cross-Realm Restarts. These seem to occur more-or-less back to back.

The Venture Company on US, does not have CRZ it's a rppvp realm.\n\nI got this tip from warcraftpets.com\n\n1. Create a dk and do the 1st 3 to 5 quests, just enough to fly down to the ground where the scarlet mobs are. \n2. Fight mobs until you get 2 gold (five minutes tops). \n3. Mail 2 gold to a Level 1 character. \n4. Log Level 1 and take Zep\/boat to Northrend, then take the the 2 gold flight to Dalaran. \n5. Next to the flight master in Dalaran, there is an Argent Ambassador. He will give you a free flight to the Argent tournament grounds. \n6. Take the short run to the Silent vigil area and tame your whelp. \n\n[b][u][i]May want to do this before 5.2 when they change respawn time.[\/i][\/u][\/b][small] [emphasis added by Bratamoli][\/small]\n\nEverytime I go in that area I see anywhere from 3 to 5.

I made it home just in time. The servers came up 5 min. after I got home. I had logged in and was watching the realm list for mine to come up. When they did I logged into my alt. parked at the tournament grounds in Icecrown (for the pet daily). There were a bunch of the whelps up of course. Myself and a few others cleared them out but no rares to be found.\r\n\r\nI got off work the next day and tried a theory I had. I went straight to my alt. in Icecrown and waited a few minutes to see if any whelps would spawn. Right at the time the servers went up the prior day the whelps spawned. They came in small batches over the course of 10-15 minutes. At least a dozen total I'd say.\r\n\r\nI made sure to be home at the same time for the next 2 days and experienced the same thing each day. Respawns 24 hours later in small waves over the course of 10-15 min.\r\n\r\nFinally, yesterday, I snagged a rare. Very exciting.

I especially want to thank [url=user=WizzardlordUK]WizzardlordUK[\/url] who got it to work when no one else seemed to be able to.\n\n[b][u]Syluxx's CRZ Work-Around[\/u] (Summary):[\/b] Go to the cross-realm zone where the pet you're after can be found, and ask a friend to invite you to a group.\n[ol][li]This works best if they are on another realm (preferably low-pop) and you are using Real ID's for the invite, but it [i]can[\/i] still work if your \"friend\" is just a guild-mate. (This works especially well if they're on an RPPVP server, but you'll have to create an RPPVP toon just to meet them.)[\/li]\n[li]Your friend must be \"your own level or higher.\" Otherwise, they get moved to [i]your[\/i] realm instead.[\/li]\n[li]Your friend [i]Should Not[\/i] be in a CRZ, esp the same CRZ that you are in. My understanding is that the largest\/most-active cities (the faction capitals) are not affected by CRZ. A group invite from someone in [zone=1519] or [zone=1497] [i]should[\/i] pull you out of the CRZ and back into your own realm-zone. (or their-realm, your-zone in the case of a higher-level Real ID friend from another realm.) (As far as I know, RPPVP servers aren't affected by CRZ, making [i]these[\/i] friends especially helpful.)[\/li]\n[li]Remember: This doesn't always work perfectly. If your realm is the CRZ-host (still not [i]completely[\/i] sure [i]exactly[\/i] how CRZ works), then an invite from a guild-mate probably will not do anything. If [u]Syluxx's CRZ Work-Around[\/u] doesn't work the first time, choose another friend and try it again.[\/li]\n[li]Finally, \"Remember: This doesn't always work perfectly.\" This is being presented as an alternative to the much more reliable [url=\/npc=62854#comments:id=1765075]Daily Respawn Theory[\/url]. If that doesn't work for you, this should eventually, but you may have to try this several times before it finally does work.[\/li][\/ol]","date":"2013-02-13T12:42:54-06:00","rating":21,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Nice copy and paste....","creationdate":"2013-02-20T12:05:41-06:00","id":634303,"rating":-20,"commentid":1813139,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"Kawney","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"THANK YOU, [url=user=Kawney]Kawney[\/url], for your reply. *upvoted to cancel someone's downvote* I had 3 short quotes from Wowhead users, with appropriate hyperlink-credits, and 1 long quote from an outside source, also hyperlinked.

The other cockraoch-and-a-half would be taken care of, no problem.\n\nAnd then these terrible words appeared on my screen: [b]Battle finished[\/b]. \n\nIt took me a few seconds to actually grasp the horrible meaning of those two words. \n\n[b]Battle finished[\/b].\n\nI lost my whelpling.

However, if you get a H\/H whelpling and don't want to farm for ANOTHER one, you could build it specifically to maximize tanking ability.\r\n\r\nThe Scourged Whelpling has no unique moves, but it does have a unique move SET.  Your choice for ability #1 is either Shadowflame or Tail Sweep.  Even P\/S whelplings are quite slow (and H\/H builds are among the slowest battle pets in the game... there are slower, but not many) so I for one would always choose Tail Sweep.  \r\n\r\nMove #2 is either Call Darkness or Death and Decay, each of which is super-effective on an uncommon type (Dragonkin or humanoids), but which are otherwise very different moves.  Even after the nerf it suffered, I'm a big fan of Call Darkness, but oddly I'd say I favor Death and Decay for the whelpling.  The why of that should become apparent shortly\r\n\r\nLastly, Move #3 is Plagued Blood or Dreadful Breath.  This is the deciding point of your build.  If you pick Plagued Blood, you are a tank.  You want to do as many hits as possible to get as much healing as possible, which means Death and Decay and Tail Sweep are practically mandatory, though one could excuse Call Darkness if particularly fearful of enemy dragonkin.  The other option, Dreadful Breath, is about equivalent to the much more common Whirlwind, but trades the 3 turn cooldown for being forced into the same move for 3 turns.  Unless you can set it up with Cleansing Rain for extra damage, it's a rather weak use of turns, which means if you're rolling with Dreadful Breath you want to avoid Call Darkness, because that would lose your Cleansing Rain weather.  Again, Death and Decay is somewhat favored over its high damage alternative.\r\n\r\nOn its own, this is a \"Cool\" pet rather than a \"Useful\" pet: a half decent tank, but nothing to write home about on the battle front.  But then you start to optimize a team around it...\r\n\r\nAqua Strider (Water Jet, Cleansing Rain, Soothe)\r\nScourged Whelpling (Tail Sweep, Death and Decay, Dreadful Breath)\r\nAnubisath Idol (Crush, Sandstorm, Either final move)\r\n\r\nAnd what you get is a very hard to kill team: The strider applies Soothe and then Cleansing Rain, letting you switch in the whelpling against a sleeping foe, at which point Dreadful Breath with extra damage begins to melt the entire enemy team while Death and Decay rots the front pet.  the Idol is one of the better tanks in the game: though it clears the Cleansing Rain, it's also nearly invulnerable on its own and can quite easily win pet battles through pure attrition, which will be easier thanks to the massive backline damage the Whelpling will be doing.","date":"2013-05-09T12:54:50-05:00","rating":28,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"If you use Plagued Blood, it's good to put in a team with Fel Flame (Scorched Earth and Flame Breath as DOTs, Conflag to do lots of damage) and Corefire Imp (Immolation for backline healing, Wild Magic to kill stuff faster).

The question to answer was [i]\"Does Plagued Blood healing scale with power?\"[\/i] and [i]\"If so, is PS better than HH for the extra healing or not?\"[\/i]\r\n\r\n[u]First of all, Plagued Blood does scale with power.[\/u] Some people have pointed out that it scales with level, but by using a level 21 HH and PS of the same quality, I was able to conclude that it does also scale with power. (and since power goes up with level, it might only be scaling with power, who knows)\r\n\r\n[b]PS[\/b]\r\nAverage heal on Tail Swipe hit: 47.9\r\nAverage heal on DnD hit: 46.47\r\n\r\n[b]HH[\/b]\r\nAverage heal on Tail Swipe hit: 50.45\r\nAverage heal on DnD hit: 50.88\r\n\r\nThese numbers are based off of roughly 50 procs of the heal, which I carefully recorded in a spreadsheet to calculate the averages.\r\n\r\nImportant to know:\r\nThe healing is based off the power behind Plagued Blood and [u]has nothing to do with the power of the attack used to proc the heal[\/u]. I figured this out by running the test a second time, but using HH's Plagued Blood and PS's attacks, then vice-versa with PS's Plagued Blood and HH's attacks. What matters is the power of the pet throwing Plagued Blood out. More power = more healing.\r\n\r\nThis means that PS will heal for about 8.5% more per heal. But is that better than the extra health of an HH breed? At level 21 Uncommon,[u] it would take 63 procs of the heal for the PS to heal for as much extra health as the HH breed has. This is because at level 21, the HH has 252 more health and the PS is only getting 4 more hp per heal.[\/u] So 252\/4 = 63 needed procs. With backlining this pet, you only get 1 proc per turn off the DnD, so it would take 63 turns before the PS came out equal to the HH breed. If you didn't backline him to get an extra 2 procs off a double hitting Tail Swipe, it would still take the entire match to come out even.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, a Tail Swipe hitting harder with more power behind it is nasty and this is the argument for getting a PS breed. The added speed is bad since it means Tail Swipe won't hit twice if you're faster, but the good news is that even with the PS breed, you'll still be slower than most opponents. With 97 level 25's, zero of my magic pets were over the 257 speed mark of a PS Scourged Whelpling (which is what Tail Swipe is super-effective against).\r\n\r\nAs far as healing goes, the HH breed wins by a long shot. It comes down to if you want this pet to tank and heal as HH, backline to heal and deal damage with DnD as HH, or burn down a magic pet with a PS breed.","date":"2014-06-26T01:30:17-05:00","rating":20,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":167,"id":2003103,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"greenland","body":"Did they buff the spawn rate on this guy or something?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>223420</b></h3>Finally found two commons after the server maintenance today. After Camping the sight for nearly a week, checking back at different times, on different characters in various stages of quests in Icecrown, I never saw any until after the server resets. It is unfortunate that the <i>ONLY</i> time you can find some of these more rare pets is to be the first to log on after maintenance/server reset. Not everyone can log on EXACTLY at that time, and if that is the only way to get some of those pets it seems a bit unfair. Not to mention <i>Cruel</i> to those camping and wasting their time if the Only spawn after the server resets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>374499</b></h3>I've scouted the area with my alt who didn't have quests done in Icecrown and didn't see any spawn. Just to be sure, I logged my main, who completed all quests, and scouted the area again. Still no spawns. So I guess that doesn't make much difference.<br /><br />While I was on my main I did see another player scouting the area, I didn't see him on my alt. That's probably a phasing thing. But just because I don't see him, doesn't mean he isn't there competing for the same pets as I do, I guess.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1044793</b></h3>Spent the past 4 days camping this lil guy...I tried everything from logging out and in, getting invites from people from other realms, zoning out and back in......nothing worked. So I camped im for 4 straight days at 18 hrs per day. NOTHING. Just got this lil guy at 12 p.m. server (my server is pacific time so it's 2 hrs behind me) and all's I did was my regular routine of flying from Dalaran to the Argent Tourny grounds. So don't give up! Cross realm zones will irritate you, but you'll get it......patience and persistence!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>519868</b></h3>If you are like me and have lots of otherwise unused alts, fly one them out to Icecrown and keep them there. You can potentially do this with two or more alts if you have some on other realms, which is what I did. Anyhow, I find camping to be pointless, so rather than waste hours AFK, I just log in randomly when I run out of stuff to do and sweep the area. It took a couple days, but eventually I found two of them up. Thankfully the first one was rare, so I left the other one up as a courtesy to others.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>vic6string</b></h3>I tried the server reset thing a couple of times, but my server (Bonechewer US) is notorious for being one of the last ones to come up after a reset. Thanks to CRZ, I always got there after these guys were all taken. So I parked a lvl 80 alt there and checked it occasionally. I would pop in and hang out for anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour...sometimes killing the NPCs in the area, sometimes only killing one of the NPC types.... in other words, I tried everything. Nothing ever seemed to work, I never saw one, and neither did any of the other campers I would run into and talk to.<br /><br />This morning, however, i was just flying around for a while, and I saw one (Monday, 5:45 am server time). I engaged it, and it was an uncommon. I won the pet battle (too close, due to not having the right pet setup, as I was not expecting to see it.. I had my lvl 9 baby ape as my first pet). When I came out of the battle, though, I saw more..... MANY MORE! It appears that when these guys spawn, they spawn as a group (I counted at least 20). This was NOT after a server reset (I had been playing for over an hour before this). No messages about CRZ reset either...just a random spawn of about 2 dozen. So if you are not one of those people that has the opportunity to get on during a server reset, you still have a shot at this guy!<br /><br />I engaged 2 more to get my rare (I know, it was greedy, but I worked for this one!), then I went to Org on another alt to announce it. Within about 3 minutes of my announcement, they were all gone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wilosoft</b></h3>I just caught 2 rares in a row, I had 2 previously common &amp; uncommon, the second rare I encountered I logged off during the fight, logged back released the common &amp; caught the rare! the place was full of them &amp; I even wrote in /1 for people to come catch them but none were in icecrown :D it was exactly at 6:45AM server time :)<br /><br />Note: I was in CRZ</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Baldulf</b></h3>Does anyone know if these share spawn points with anything? There aren't any critters in these areas that I've seen. Has anyone tried slaughtering the Frostbrood Whelps to force spawns?<br /><br />All I lacked in the beta for Northrend Safari was Arctic Fox Kit, so I'm pretty sure I caught one of these fairly easily then (unless they didn't exist in beta). I have yet to see ONE spawn on live, and I've been checking at all hours of the day for weeks. I'm on the same character I used to cap Northrend pets in the beta, too, so I don't think it's a phasing issue.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Neiji</b></h3>After reading all comments here I decided to check Sindragosa's Fall one last time before going to bed and voila, the place was full of em. At least 5 whelplings had shown up.<br /><br />Was around 6.12 am server time.<br /><br />Edit: First one was uncommon and then I found a rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Equeon</b></h3>About 9 or 10 of these were up right after a server reset. Although they will be given more legitimate &quot;spawn timers,&quot; not affected by restarts or maintenance, like most other rare mobs after 5.1, until then your best bet is to log in right after maintenance ends.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aquifel</b></h3>Ive been dual camping the Main Spawn area (Sindragosa's Fall/Silent Vigil) and the 15.6/56.6 point for kicks. I only leave it on about 12 hours a day while i do other things, there is zero competion in the 15/56 point and i have seen absolutely zero spawns here (and only 1 other person during this time), Sin/Vigil area is HEAVILY camped, almost as bad as minfernal. I have not seen the whelpling at all since i started camping, however i have heard of a single fellow camper catching it while i was camping it (probably one or 2 more on opposite faction). I have not been able to catch the server restarts, but have heard from several friends that they fought 5-10 by themselves and most of them got rares at this time. <br /><br />Killing non-pet battle mobs in the area does not seem to have an immediate effect on spawns (Including the flying wyrms, i had a theory that they were similar to diemtradon hatchlings in that they spawned with their 'mothers', but no luck with that method yet), and wiping the area of other pet battle mobs seems to only spawn more cockroaches in adjacent areas. The only thing i can think of that i haven't tried is checking for multiple phases of Sindragosa's Fall, i'm working an alt through icecrown quests to see if anything happens, but no changes so far.<br /><br />In my opinion, the 15/56 point is just bugged wowhead data, but, i would very much like to hear from anyone who has seen one there. Also, i don't believe the scourged whelpling is tied to anything else in terms of its spawning, i think it is just horribly long.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cheshin</b></h3>This morning I started my search for a Scourged Whelpling, I first moved my alt to a low Populated server and parked at Sindragosa's Fall to camp, there were no active spawns at all.<br /> I was messing about for 10 minutes moving alts to the Minfernal camping spots also I then logged on to my main character on a Medium population server to also check and found a full wave of around 6-9 of them active, around 10am UK time, I managed to catch one then checked my first character alt, I found 3 active spawns also. <br /> I am unsure whether it's pot luck but the spawns seemed to be relatively close, first server was a Medium Population, second was Low Population.<br /> So you don't need to wait until server reset to see a wave of them as confirmed to those who feel a bit deterred waiting, park alts on Low/Medium Population servers and check back every so often! Do the same for other rares also :)<br /> I did not kill anything in the area either at all.<br /> Best of luck, hope this information at least perks those up who are struggling to believe they exist :)<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Cheshin<br /><br />Edit: Typo ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gnorkthedark</b></h3>When occasionally checking Sindragosa's Fall for this pet, the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=46874">Argent Crusader's Tabard</a> will be your best friend.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1043922</b></h3>I've been checking for this pet for two months a couple times daily, and never ever even saw one. Just did one of my daily cruises through the area and there were FOUR of them up. I got a common quality one, the others were snatched up immediately. This was on a Sunday afternoon around 3:30 pm realm time. No idea why there were suddenly some available, but I think luck plays a huge part in it. Really frustrating.<br /><br />ETA: All four of the spawns were very close to the Tournament grounds, just around where the road leads into it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1057369</b></h3>so maybe someone can shed some light here - I've done this with several characters on different realms. I take a fp from dalaran to the tournament grounds and on the way there I'll pass over 7 or 8 green paws showing as scourged whelpling. when I rush down to the spots I saw the whelplings, there's nothing there to tame. the fp back to dalaran shows no whelplings either. I'm assuming this is some sort of cross realm issue, so I asked a friend to invite me to their group - no dice. has anyone found a way around this issue?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Clopin</b></h3>Spent almost a week camping this pet on two different servers, checking in several times a day at different times on both servers with no luck. Nov 21, spent about 4 hours flying around Sindragosa's Fall/Silent Vigil, from 1:40 am to 5:45 am, with absolutely no luck. Decided to give it another 15 min before calling it quits for the night, which turned out to be a good idea. As soon as it hit 6 am server time, these started spawning. First one I caught was poor, second was uncommon, then I left figuring I'd leave any others for someone else to grab. Quite an interesting phenomenon that at 6am on the dot the whelplings started spawning. Not sure if it was just my luck or if this is an actual spawn time for them, but I'd say give it a shot if you're up at that ungodly hour. Captured on my Nelf hunter Taanipu Uldaman, though I have no idea what server I was actually on courtesy of CRZ.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>spingus</b></h3>Teleported to the Argent Tourney grounds to check out the snow situation in Storm Peaks. On the way I found two spawns of Scourged Whelpling adjacent to Quel'delar's Rest. The one I challenged was green. <br /><br />This was at 2:48pm server time on a Sunday afternoon with no resets in the previous 48 hours (yes I was on most of that time).<br /><br />edit:<br /><br />In the time it took me to post this note another spawned just south of the previous two ~2:58pm</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1058010</b></h3>I made a wowhead account exclusively to tell this story. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!<br /><br />I had been checking Silent Vigil/Sindragosa's Fall almost daily (2-4 times a day) for many weeks and I periodically visited this page to see if any new tips had been posted. I recently read someone's post that said they got their whelpling when it was NOT a server restart (which I am unable to camp, as well as being on the &amp;*!@e end of CRZ nonsense anyway) so I used it as encouragement to ALWAYS check my alt parked in Icecrown when I'm logging into the game, no matter what. I almost didn't do it today, but I thought &quot;ehh it's just 30 seconds, whatever&quot; and I saw one glorious green paw on my map - right in front of me! Poor quality shmoor quality, this thing is RARE in my eyes :] I thought I was hallucinating.<br /><br />The coords were around 75.68, 36.03 (right above the &quot;O&quot; in &quot;Sindragosa's&quot;) in Silent Vigil. It was 3:43pm PST (local time, didn't notice the current realm time) and there was not just a server reset. There were also no other spawns and no one else camping at the time, so this was just meant to be for me! If you can stand it, just keep checking regularly and eventually you will get one of these for yourself. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nolapete</b></h3>Prior to 11/17/2012, I had only seen a total of 4 spawns and as many others have said, this was right after a restart and tons of people camping.<br /><br />On 11/17/2012 I was up helping my wife with the baby and took a chance logging on a 7 am when I was done to check for whelplings. I hardly expected to find what I did; it must have been an entire spawn of them, at least 15-20 and they were all mine.<br /><br />Up until this time, I had only captured one poor quality, but now I was able to capture two uncommons and continue my hunt for a rare. After checking all the ones I saw up, I was about to leave and decided to make one more pass. I was content with my two uncommons, but everyone wants rare right?<br /><br />After flying around looking, I spot two that must have been respawns because they weren't there before. The first wasn't rare, so I forfeited to check the other and voila it was RARE! I found him a little ways out at 73.30, 49.19.<br /><br />Love me some Dreadful Breath!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jeolene</b></h3>So, I'm wondering if these are a morning/afternoon spawn. I can't say for sure, but I got up for work and jumped on to find these hanging around all over the place, that was about 11am (10am realm time). The only reason I wonder about this is because any time I've been checking has always been after 5pm all the way to about 4am, but the one time I log in earlier and I find them all over, maybe just lack of people farming, but on two realms I hardly ever seen anyone looking for them, might be something to check out and verify :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1061181</b></h3>I can confirm that exactly 10:01 am server time these guys spawned. I got a uncommon one and stopped there. :) good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1062573</b></h3>This is currently the only Undead pet that has Humanoid attacks. The reason this is important is that means that this pet has attacks that do extra damage to Dragons and it also takes less damage from Dragons. That being said, this is only minimally helpful as few Dragons use purely Dragon-based attacks (usually using a mixture of Dragon and some other element), and Scourged Whelp's spammable Humanoid attack isn't particularly strong. Still, if running into issues with a Dragon enemy, this is something to consider.<br /><br />On an added note, there aren't many pets that have the property of having strong attacks to a certain element and also being resistant to attacks from that element. Jade Owl (<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=120501#comments">http://www.wowhead.com/spell=120501#comments</a>) does this against Aquatic pets.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Iconyx</b></h3>I started recording the pets I engaged in a spreadsheet. Out of 585 pets battled, 48% were poor quality, 24% were common quality, 24% were uncommon quality, and 4% were rare. This means that, on average, for pets that only occur once per wild pet group (like <a href="/npc=62854/scourged-whelpling">Scourged Whelpling</a>) you are more than likely to find a rare quality pet only after having engaged <b>17 different groups</b>. At that point, the odds are in your favor, but there's still no guarantee you'll have found a rare.<br /><br />For the sake of everyone else trying to capture pets that operate on a frustratingly-long spawn timer, just capture one and upgrade it.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1065942</b></h3>Had to make an account just to tell people.<br />Had no luck finding this on 3 servers, so at the server restart I was there waiting for them. There was quite a few of us waiting for them.<br />Logged in and saw lots of them. I tagged the closest not caring about the quality as I was lucky to be able to get one at all, and the one and only that I tagged was a rare!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1065953</b></h3>So after reading everyone's suggestions on how to obtain this pet I decided to wait until a server restart, which was a cross server restart. I did also however continue to check the area for pets at different points in the day. Before our servers restart this morning I headed out to the area with the restart at about 11 minutes, when an announcement was made that our (low populated) server was also being restarted. I circled the area and found nothing. While waiting people were talking in general, we had one person bragging how they farmed every rare in Northrend and next he was going after the Scourged Whelpling. A few of us told him if it wasn't rare log out so someone trying to find any quality pet may get this pet instead. He basically told us that that wasn't going to happen. With one minute left until the restart wouldn't you know that they all started respawning, I was able to click onto one of them to start battling, and with the trap missing 3 to 4 times there was no way I was going to finish the battle. I finally am able to log back on between cross server restart and our servers restart with 30 seconds left. The pets were all up from what I could tell. From the time my server restarted and being able to log back in everyone from the cross realm servers took every one of these pets. VERY frustrating, especially with someone just looking for a rare. Please be respectful of other players! And if you are looking for rares with a spawn timer similar to these guys log out if it isn't a rare so someone else can have a chance at this pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>892892</b></h3>Ok, i had virtually zero luck looking for this little guy until today. Ive tried server restarts and random other times when im not at work. From everythign ive gathered and put together, they spawn on a set timer and are part of a bucket spawn. This means that they spawn at a certain time and when they are captured they are done until the next spawn. I logged in at 1030 am server. (This is important because of cross realm). Did my daily pet battle at the tamer, thinking ill never get the scourged whelp so ill dissapoint myself later. Flew down to sindragosas fall and there were dozens of them up. I actually managed to get a rare of both breeds.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>blkdeath75</b></h3>These will DEFINITELY respawn after any cross realm restarts. I went because I saw one coming in chat and had a regular server restart as well counting down 2 minutes behind it. As soon as the cross realm restarted it kicked everyone from Icecrown, I spam logged back in to see 3-4 right under where I was hovering. By the time the battle was started I had 45 seconds to my realm restart counting down. I capped the whelp, killed 1 and just barely killed the second pet as my realm went down.<br /><br />I threw a fit thinking I didn't make it in time, but was extremely happy to see him in my collection after the realm came back up. It was a common but who cares! Also a note, as soon as my realm restarted I looked around and didn't see even one. I asked in general chat and said I got one but other CRZ'ers said they never saw any at all(weird), but I know they were there cause I got it.<br /><br />Definitely a heart stopper!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>134708</b></h3>Not sure if this is 100% but it worked for me today while hunting this little bugger.<br /><br />The CRZ is madness and that's all I will say about that because I can rant on this for days but I digress. When flying from Dalaran to Argent Tournament Grounds, Sindragosa's Fall is always littered with them. Once landing, the phasing begins and presto! the fields are now empty :/<br /><br />I read on another pet post about making a &quot;/tar (insert name)&quot; macro and binding it to a hotkey. While in taxi, (and pet is highlighted) click the &quot;interact&quot; key. This supposedly fights the CRZ phasing and engages with the pet once the taxi has landed. I did not test this out until today.<br /><br />Flying from Dal to Tourney Grounds, once I made it over Sindragosa's Fall I used my hotkey on the field of whelps. Once I landed, I wasout of range to keep the whelp highlighted. However to my surprise when I made it the location where I had targeted the whelp while in taxi, there was my pet!<br /><br />Not sure if it will work (ever again) or at all but hey, anything is worth a try.<br /><br />Happy Hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>699353</b></h3>I kept flying over the place for a month and found nothing. So on monday morning (31-12-12) I woke up early to see if there are any up. It was 7 am and again nothing. Around 7:30 I checked 1 more time before going back to bed and I found 2 of poor quality. Around 7:58 another spawned and it was an uncommon one and I was happy with that. Will use a stone to make it a rare I guess.<br /><br />But this shows that they do spawn at different times and not just with the server reset.<br /><br />Keep trying and you'll find one.<br /><br />Good luck everyone!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1070984</b></h3>Guys to freak you all out do the following: <br /><br />Go to Dalaran and take a bird from the flight master to the tournament grounds...and just watch your mini-map when you fly over Sindragosa's Fall...<br /><br />I see at least 4 spawned every time, can even click them..but when you land at TG and go back they are gone...<br /><br />When you do the same with your own mount, you will not see them.<br />If you start from tournament grounds to Dalaran, you will not see them.<br /><br />Personally i think these babies are available in one of the phases of the zone, so I just started leveling one of my alts up to be able to do quests in the zone again, and figure out in which phase they are available.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gershuun</b></h3>About 5 of these spawned at about 10:30am server time for me so check at about that time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1071589</b></h3>Just 1 real quick question. Why does everyone submit closeups only? Why is there not a picture from a outward view of the mobb or anything else to help identify what to look for? Just wondering.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jturnero</b></h3>Here to confirm they spawn after rolling restart. Server Shu-halo, after restart this morning at 5:14 server, 8:14 for me 'cus I live on east coast I fly up from Dalaran. I see what seems like 10 of them. First is poor and second is uncommon. All the time watching people fly in and devour these whelps quicker than a bear devours honey. By the time I finish second battle there are no more to be found, which is perfectly fine b/c I would have been happy with the poor. I can not confirm yet that they are on 24 hour spawn timer, I will come back and edit my comment tomorrow letting you know my findings.<br /><br />EDIT: So I went back this morning at 8:15 and there were about a dozen of them up. I have an uncommon so I left them for others. Now that I know how they spawn I can wait until after 5.2 to grab my rare. Supposedly at that point you will be able to exit battle with out battle pet disappearing which will be nice b/c I hate wasting a battle pet someone else can get, especially ones that are so hard to find. <br /><br />So needless to say although my sample size is small I am pretty sure these spawn on 24 hour timer or at least a multiple of 24, i.e. 6 or 12 hours. Uprate this so everyone will know how to get one of these beautiful pets. Happy Hunting :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Iconyx</b></h3>I searched Sindragosa's Fall 30+ times over the past 2 months at various times of day for durations of 3-10 minutes. Never saw a single one.<br /><br />Server AND Cross-Realm Zone reset at 8AM EST yesterday, 1/8/13, still wasn't able to find any between 8:05AM and 8:15AM.<br /><br />Logged in today at 8AM EST today, waited for 15 minutes, and... you guessed it. Respawns. Lots of respawns.<br /><br />Nothing revolutionary, just adding to the body of evidence that suggests CRZ/Server resets +24hrs are the key to catching this elusive beast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zharon</b></h3>Interesting. I just see a post made 2 minutes before I started typing this one.<br /><br />It is 8:28 AM EST here and as I was flying back from the argent tourney to Dalaran, I noticed TONS of these. (no, I was not flying on a flight path, I always mount up and fly back)<br /><br />Could these perhaps be set to spawn around 8-8:30 AM server time?<br /><br />One thing is for sure: they spawn in DROVES. With the Minfernal, you will see just 1 spawn VERY rarely. When these Whelplings spawn, they spawn en masse.<br /><br />Since I already had one that I made rare with a battle stone, I just left them alone and informed people in trade chat.<br /><br />EDIT: and another post from yesterday below stating that they found it at 8:14 AM EST.<br /><br />I think we may have figured out when they spawn. It makes sense that they spawn after server maintenance, since the servers are normally down during this timeframe!</div>

While I was flying I saw (in the minimap) plenty of those pets (I moused over their icons so I'm sure 100% that they were whelps). When I went back to the area (from the flight master) I found none.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>llangevi</b></h3>As an aside, I got bored after days of this so I decided to kill EVERYTHING, and picked every herb, and shot all of the dragons out of the sky, and made the undead die, and the cultists die, and all of the baby welps fall and redie.<br /><br />As I looked around me I saw everything come back to the way it was. The theory that killing stuff will cause a pet to spawn in it's place has therefore been disproven about this critter. I commeetted mass genocide and it just smirked and came back to it's natural mocking state!<br /><br />I am a tailor, and I noticed that one pass gave me one and a half stacks of Frostweave cloth, and I had enough herbs for the Northrend Inscription Disvory for several days.<br /><br />Still waiting for that welp on my level 86 monk. If you see me hovering on my Headless Horseman mount, wave hello. I may be here for awhile while testing out all of the theories in this this post.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nyshah</b></h3>I scouted over the area this morning before I learned it was a very rare spawn. I gave up and carried on catching other ones in Northrend. I tried my luck again this (Friday) afternoon at 14.27, using the argent tabard as transportation tool and yes, I was lucky enough to find one. A common one, but nonetheless. <br /><br />Just as well my exam got cancelled this afternoon, otherwise I would have been in an exam room as opposed to checking for this pet ^.^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ghostwolfpup</b></h3>Out of curiosity today since I learned of the way to catch the super rare Minfernal, I thought that I would check and see if you could do the same thing to catch this little guy.<br /><br />I took the flight path from Wintergrasp to the Argent Tournament, and though you could fly over Sindragosa's Fall and see Scourged Whelpings, you couldn't interact with any of them. The flight path is too high off the ground for any of them. Bummer. CRZ is horrible for some of these pets!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>694270</b></h3>I passed over the area to check for these on my way to Storm Peaks, a few minutes before noon server time. There was nothing but I flew around Storm Peaks a bit hoping the weather would change, but alas, no. I decided to check again a few minutes after noon and there was one just south of the tournament grounds. It was a poor quality but I was happy to take it. There were no others in the area so I flew back to Storm Peaks and saw nothing so I decided to check again and found another to the south. Uncommon! So if you see only one check back a few minutes later. I saw another person enter the area searching after that so I stopped checking to let them have one if any more spawned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sagentine</b></h3>If you are having a problem with this or any other rare companion, create a DK on Ravenholdt or add a person to your Real ID if you don't mind giving it out to a stranger. Ravenholdt is a low populated RPPVP server. If the pets are not up, then at least you have way less competition or you can try again later. So far I haven't had a problem with none being up.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Castor27</b></h3>I've been camping these for a good while, and reading some of the &quot;Spawns at 8:00&quot; comments I got to thinking maybe there was something to it. Not that they spawn at 8, but what if they are on a 24 hour timer. I barely missed the server restarts yesterday, but the server I caught mine on today (Thorium Brotherhood) came up a little before 12:15 and the spawns were all gone before I could log in. So I decided to make sure I camped there today, at that time. Sure enough today I logged in at 12:00 and flew around for a while. At 12:08 there they were; a load of them spawned at once. That would explain the 8:00 spawning as being when the server came up from a restart and the following days spawning at about 24 hours later. No idea if I am completely correct but my advice would be that if you miss a server restart, note the time of the restart and try to camp a little earlier the next day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>785932</b></h3>So after my roommate told me about this, I looked up this page. Good insights. The night before xrealm reset too, so good timing! I parked at Sindragosa's Fall, and logged in early the next day. Server wasn't supposed to be up till 12pm my time, checked at 11am. Made a sandwhich, came back at 1107, and sure enough it was up, and when i got in two were right below me. Grabbed the closest one and it was a rare, first try, captured it easily. Sweet! So confirmed, xrealm reset is a good time to get them, good luck fellow pet hunters. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1070613</b></h3>The second i time i took a flight from Flightmaster in Dalaran to Argent Tournament Grounds. When i was above the area i saw about 4-6 Scourged whelplings. I moused over so i could see these were the right pets to battle. When i arrived at the grounds i mounted up flew down to the area. Not a single pet. WTF? But as mentioned i SAW them just seconds before. Kinda strange.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>volatar</b></h3>EDIT: <b>I tested this out for 2 days and I can confirm that they DO spawn 24 hours after a server reset and again 24 hours later</b>. I missed logging on right after the servers went up this week 01/29/2013, but I went back for 2 days after and seen like 10-15 whelps each time spawn around 12:13pm EST to 12:16pm EST. No one else was around so I went until I either cleared them out or got the rare I was after. I'm not sure if maybe the CRZ was being reset at that time and it took me out of that or they were spawned while CRZ was going. No one else was around so I can't prove that part. I am on Turalyon server if that helps any.<br /><br />**As I am typing this, I'm flipping back and forth between here and WoW. I'm noticing people from other servers now and I don't see any whelps. Not sure if they were picked up or CRZ possibly kicked back in and phased them out. It is 12:36pm EST when I noticed this.<br /><br /><s>I'm still working on catching this pet</s>, but for those of you that want a fun macro to use while flying around the spawn area, you are welcome to use this one.<br /><br />/cleartarget<br />/target Scourged Whelpling<br />/stopmacro <br />/focus<br />/run if GetRaidTargetIndex(&quot;focus&quot;) ~= 7 then SetRaidTarget(&quot;focus&quot;,7) end<br />/script PlaySoundFile(&quot;Sound\\Creature\\HeadlessHorseman\\Horseman_Beckon_01.wav&quot;)<br /><br />When one is finally up, it will target the Scourged Whelpling, mark it with a red <b>X</b> over its head and you will have the Headless Horseman yelling at you saying &quot;Get over here you idiot!&quot;<br /><br />This can be used for other things by changing out the necessary parts. I just chose the cross since it is easier to see against the snow.<br /><br />If you want to change the icon that it marks with, you can replace both 7's in the macro with:<br />1 = Star<br />2 = Circle<br />3 = Diamond<br />4 = Triangle<br />5 = Moon<br />6 = Square<br />7 = Cross<br />8 = Skull<br /><br />Have fun with it and happy pet hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zarrise</b></h3>maybe i'm just super unlucky. i've camped this guy for a couple days 7:45 AM - 1 PM server time. popped in at random times not in the window that other people say they're spawning. i haven't seen one - ever! not even while flying over via a flight path. very discouraging!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nemo74</b></h3>Well I have been camping this pet for the last 18 hours with a 3 hour nap. I am on an EST server. I started at 6:30ish PM I went until 5ish AM. Took a 3 hour nap, Got back at it 8am server. At 12:40 TWO whelps spawned. 1st one was green so I took it. I did a /who and I was alone in Icecrown so I checked the other and it was grey. I was told they spawn in large groups so flew around for another 10 in and no other whelps spawned.<br /><br />Not sure what any of that means, I just wanted to detail how I found it with time and amounts. I got a green, but would have been happy with grey :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1002897</b></h3>Tip if you want one of these. The Venture Company on US, does not have CRZ it's a rppvp realm.<br /><br />I got this tip from warcraftpets.com<br /><br />1. Create a dk and do the 1st 3 to 5 quests, just enough to fly down to the ground where the scarlet mobs are. <br />2. Fight mobs until you get 2 gold (five minutes tops). <br />3. Mail 2 gold to a Level 1 character. <br />4. Log Level 1 and take Zep/boat to Northrend, then take the the 2 gold flight to Dalaran. <br />5. Next to the flight master in Dalaran, there is an Argent Ambassador. He will give you a free flight to the Argent tournament grounds. <br />6. Take the short run to the Silent vigil area and tame your whelp. <br /><br />May want to do this before 5.2 when they change respawn time.<br /><br />Everytime I go in that area I see anywhere from 3 to 5. Yes, you will die often, so try to find one in an area without a bunch of mobs. Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SFFCorgi</b></h3>I just had a chilling thought, no pun intended although annoyingly appropriate -- the Whelpling wouldn't happen to be affected by phasing, would it? I've not done Icecrown quests yet, and I know this is keeping me from seeing one of the rare spawns except from the 'taxi'.<br /><br />How can we test this, any ideas?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tommytom</b></h3>I believe the spawn rate is going up come patch, but if you cant wait I have made a dk and leveled him to 58 or until where he can leave to org. I then leave org to borean tundra and then take the 2g fp like someone earlier mentioned to Dalaran. I like the DK because he can mount and have a little quicker speed and wont get one shot.<br /><br />Now everyone says to go to Sindragosa Fall and yes you will find them mostly here, but I used my mount and ran all the way to 73, 50 near the mountains and in this wide open area with no mobs I just had 4 here, and then working up there were more. Since there was no one in the zone I had gotten a green whelp and was satisfied, but noticed there was one more in the open field and said what the heck and it turned out to be a rare.<br /><br />I tried for hours just at the start of Sindragosa Fall from the argent tourny and just decided to go for a drive lol This open field is where I found a lot of spawns, this was on Ravenholdt RPPVP NA server, just now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Furbzz</b></h3><b>CONFIRMED FOR BUG</b><br /><br />25/2/12 (oceanic)<br /><br />Unfortunately after talking to a GM today about the fact I kept seeing the icons (and battle pets) on multiple characters when flying over, yet they disappeared to no where once i tried to enter the area.<br /><br />This appears to be in relation to being lucky with one particular quest chain. Yet they have no idea what causes it at this date. <br /><br /><b>Screenshot from GM Convo: </b><br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/YEv1dYO.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/YEv1dYO.jpg</a><br /><br />Also mentioned that they are working on it, mentioned a change by next patch but nothing confirmed in regards to this particular NPC, merely they are working on the bug and should hopefully be fixed for next patch.<br /><br />As of yet I haven't worked out a way to do the /tar engage from a flightpath as the one from Dala appears to go a little too high. <br /><br />If anyone can add to this with any possible work around and solutions would be great.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1014950</b></h3>Some (hopefully) helpful tips if you are using PinkiePie24's method, which by the way does work.<br /><br />1) You finish all the beginning things in Acherus, then get the quest to report to Prince Valnarr.<br />2) You report to him, and accept the next quest he offers, then find Orlun the Battlecaller, the valkyr in the small pit, who offers you a quest that pays 2g plus some silver. Accept and do that quest, turn it in and you have your 2g.<br />3) When your lvl 1 toon reaches Dalaran, set your hearthstone there.<br />4) Take the free flight offered to the Argent Tournament Grounds and watch for the paws.<br />5) Once you land, if you saw no paws, heartth back to Dalaran.<br /><br />You can repeat the free flight to the tournament grounds unlimited times, so you can try at random times between doing other things, like lvling a new alt on your home realm or grinding rep with the Pandaren factions on your lvl 90 toon. Good luck, hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Teevo</b></h3>So a couple of things as I have immersed myself in the scourged whelpling mess:<br /><br />- RP/PVP servers ARE apart of crz (<a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/US_realm_list_by_datacenter" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowwiki.com/US_realm_list_by_datacenter</a>)<br />- This is NOT a quest phasing issue... it is solely due to CRZ<br />- When you fly over using the free flight from the Argent Tourny guy and see a ton of scourged whelps down below.. but then notice they are nowhere to be found when you land and walk/fly over... its because they were up on YOUR realm. Unfortunately, when you land... you are transferred off your realm and onto the datacenter your realm is affiliated with.<br /><br />I've been working on this one for a few weeks, and will continue to provide info as I come across it. I am curious to see if any of this gets changed with the new patch coming... I doubt it will, I dont consider us that lucky. Nevertheless, my hunt continues.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gabunga</b></h3>Since there seems to exist some consensus about the appearance of these beasties around server reset time, I thought it might be a good idea to log in today - wednesday being patching day. So I got to Icecrown around 9:45 (which is well before the <i>announced</i> time WoW would go online again) and found... well... nothing at first. <br /><br />But lo and behold! Out of nowhere pops a green paw! And even better: there's no-one around to snatch it away, so I can actually engage the dratted thing in battle. It's a grey one, but hey - who cares? Everyone who checks out this page can understand how elated I felt when I finally managed to cage the little bugger. <br /><br />Now my first <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62621">pet</a> took some damage in the process and died halfway through one of the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=61384">cockroaches</a> that accompanied <i>my </i>whelpling (yes, I had already started to consider it mine...), but that's OK (I thought) because I have two more blue level 25's slotted. The other cockraoch-and-a-half would be taken care of, no problem.<br /><br />And then these terrible words appeared on my screen: <b>Battle finished</b>. <br /><br />It took me a few seconds to actually grasp the horrible meaning of those two words. <br /><br /><b>Battle finished</b>.<br /><br />I lost my whelpling. I felt like this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gollum.PNG" rel="nofollow">other chap</a> must have felt after losing <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=8350">some jewellery</a>... My precious whelpling! And I had no idea what just happened. So I hit &lt;shift-P&gt; to find that somewhere in the process of patching the machine (or the process - I don't see any logic in blaming <a href="http://eu.blizzard.com/en-gb/" rel="nofollow">someone in particular</a>...) had decided to unslot two of my pets. Now as a rule I am a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/graphics/meditate-tiny.jpg" rel="nofollow">very calm person</a>. You know, balanced. My response to this situation, however, was... well... let's just say '<a href="http://realitypod.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/explosion.jpg" rel="nofollow">somewhat uncharacteristic</a>' and leave it at that. <br /><br />Now of course there's a lesson to be learned here: ALWAYS CHECK YOUR PETS FIRST! Please do yourself a favour and learn this lesson from <i>my</i> experience rather than your own...<br /><br />P.S.: less han two minutes later I found another one and bagged it. I'm back to my calm collected self now. Yay for the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=6588">Northrend Safari</a> Achievement!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>174266</b></h3>I don't believe the issue is crz or server restarts is the issue.. After hearthing using the argent tabard many times and getting nothing with a toon that is loremaster - i took a toon that never did any quests in ice crown. The last server restart was 7am. I saw like nine of them at 10pm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Furbzz</b></h3>Post 5.2 <br /><br />If you are trying to catch one after various restarts etc on a CRZ server; the problem you might see is that CRZ realm is down (if you get past the world server is down etc for northrend). <br /><br />This means the sindragosa's fall will most likely be empty and devoid all mobs, don't worry about relogging or swapping toons or anything though as eventually the respawns will pop up. <br /><br />The area becomes packed again and all the whelp paws are up for action, with the 5.2 changes re: battle pets managed to take a couple of pet bandages and after I got my poor, farm around looking for a rare without despawning mobs for other players. <br /><br />Took about 5mins after a restart and I got my northrend safari, a poor, a uncommon and a rare. The uncommon and rare of different breeds, with the uncommon having more HP (1260 vs 1423 - both at 21 captured) but the rare having much higher speed(216 vs 176). Planning to use a stone on the uncommon if I decide the HP necessary. <br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>324959</b></h3>*I would like to share this story for those farming this lil bugger*:, I have been camped in Icecrown for over a week trying to find my Rare.The spawn rate has been 1-2 every 15-20 minutes and I would do this for about 3 hrs at a time at all times day and night. I have had an uncommon that I grabbed the first day it had 1426 hp's at lvl 21, I have not seen ONE (gray, white or uncommon) with higher. <br /><br />So I continued my search for the rare until until today, at reset, I logged in to find about 10 of them and the 5th one I encountered was my RARE! I was super exited ...however .. I used a pet with poison and sadly killed it but NOT before noticing that a lvl 23 (rare) it only had 1043hp's ..( A lil fact that I failed to mention was the I had an undead battlestone sitting in my bag in the event I never saw my rare). In my mind was I was happy I found the rare and the long wait was over so I used the stone on my uncommon and dropped it down to a lvl 19 but still has better stats than the Rare lvl 23. It still has 1397 at lvl 19.So now I have my rare from an uncommon and it's a welcomed addition to the 2 other members of his team Dark Phoenix Hatchling and Restless Shade to complete my Dark Team!<br /><br />Good Luck and Happy Hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>555434</b></h3>I finally got one of these guys today!<br />I was on my way to ToC to two-man the Beasts of Northrend, when my friend said in chat that he was in a pet battle with a Scourged Whelpling. I was in disbelief, but when I caught up with him, there were FIVE Scourged Whelplings out and about.<br />The first one I engaged was a rare (HUZZAH!), and I didn't engage any more after I caught it.<br /><br />The only way I can rationalize this stroke of luck was because I had invited my friend (same realm) from the Shrine of Two Moons, which typically isn't a CRZ. So since I was the leader and the &quot;anchor&quot; in a sense, I must have phased my friend into the actual realm-version of Icecrown instead of the CRZ version.<br /><br />However, we tried this with the Minfernal with no luck.<br /><br />I hope all you fellow tamers have the best of luck hunting this rare pet!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>881991</b></h3>Well, I don't know if this will work for others, but worked for me. I arrived from work and after crafting the cooldowns on some of my chars I decided to give it a try. I took my tinker gnome rogue (since it has the and took him to the area. Of course, it was already about 7:10pm PCT and there were non spawning in the area (and a couple horde were also flying around, so I suppose they were also checking).<br />The only scourge whelpings were the NPC ones with about 10-12k hp (red flagged).... but not even one pet to tame. <br />Since the pet and the npc were named the same, I decided to start &quot;clearing out&quot; a bit the area in hopes that they shared the spawner. Since it was just 1 hit with the ranged weapon, I also killed some of the other mobs (easy g from the loot). After like 5 minutes, I saw that there was a newly spawned Scourge battle pet... got into a pet battle and voila... my new scourged is in my pet list. <br />I was also really lucky because it was of rare quality (not bad for first attempt), so I didn't checked any longer if they were spawning more or not. <br />Hopefully this will work for others too without having to wait for server restarts. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Organthrone</b></h3>Logged on (EU) Thunderhorn at about 10:30am server time, and I found one right next to me, just above Quel'Delar's Rest. Captured it, poor, still happy. Flew down Sindragosa's Rest, and there were about four or five fluttering around. Ironically, it's one of the only instances where I've not seen any other players around. Rather than hunt out a rare (got a battle-stone in case I ever want to make it so), I left them for others to discover. I'm nice like that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Noobheart</b></h3>I was scared before I went to hunt one of these. I read comments on here and everyone was saying how they have been trying to get one for weeks and I knew that I didn't want to wait that long. I decided to go ahead and check for one of these bad boys anyway and i found one almost instantly. It was uncommon and I was so excited. I flew around a bit more and later found another that was poor quality, so I left him there for another lucky pet hunter to get. Good luck to all the pet hunters out there trying to catch one of these guys. CRZ gives us a lot of competition so I wish the best!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1116200</b></h3>Don't know if they fixed the spawn rate of these pets; but I got on my pally (I'm on a PvP realm and wasn't in a party). Flew over to Icecrown. Went to Sindragosa's Fall. Went to look right where the &quot;o&quot; of Sindragosa's Fall lands on the map. There was a whelp there. Poor quality. Flew a little south and ran into another one, green quality. This was server time 11:30 PM, on a Wednesday. I'm on Korgath. I guess I got lucky?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1116883</b></h3>I just wanted to put this out there in case it might help someone else. I have read in multiple places about how hard this pet is to get and how people never see spawns. I only had level 16 pets (Relentless Shadeling, Onyxian Whelpling, Infinite Whelpling) and thought I'd cruise up there just to check it out and see if one was up. So, it was up. It was just a gray and my pets owned it. Next day, a green, my pets were level 18. Then tonight another green...captured him and immediately another spawned, a rare. I won't be going back now. <br /><br />I'm on Moonrunner-US. I have never seen anyone else in the area. I have found all three spawns to the very north. So if you have the heart to then roll a DK on Moonrunner and go check it out. I've seen them all in the late evening/night. It's now 12:45 am and I just got my rare about 20 minutes ago.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Djmax</b></h3>I recommend going at off-hours instead of camping. I managed to find a common quality one just south of Quel'Delar's rest at approximately 2:30am server time on a Monday, right before server reset; no camping, no hassle, no competition.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>spawnova</b></h3>Got a poor one right after dailies reset, glad to finally get one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TevishSzat</b></h3>There's a lot of talk about how to get one of these little guys without freezing your rear off just camping Icecrown for hours on end (though it seems to no longer be quite so terrible), but little talk about what you actually get.<br /><br />First of all, these guys come in two breeds: Power/Speed or Health/Health, In general, I prefer my pets to have power and more power so the P/S breed would be superior. However, if you get a H/H whelpling and don't want to farm for ANOTHER one, you could build it specifically to maximize tanking ability.<br /><br />The Scourged Whelpling has no unique moves, but it does have a unique move SET. Your choice for ability #1 is either Shadowflame or Tail Sweep. Even P/S whelplings are quite slow (and H/H builds are among the slowest battle pets in the game... there are slower, but not many) so I for one would always choose Tail Sweep. <br /><br />Move #2 is either Call Darkness or Death and Decay, each of which is super-effective on an uncommon type (Dragonkin or humanoids), but which are otherwise very different moves. Even after the nerf it suffered, I'm a big fan of Call Darkness, but oddly I'd say I favor Death and Decay for the whelpling. The why of that should become apparent shortly<br /><br />Lastly, Move #3 is Plagued Blood or Dreadful Breath. This is the deciding point of your build. If you pick Plagued Blood, you are a tank. You want to do as many hits as possible to get as much healing as possible, which means Death and Decay and Tail Sweep are practically mandatory, though one could excuse Call Darkness if particularly fearful of enemy dragonkin. The other option, Dreadful Breath, is about equivalent to the much more common Whirlwind, but trades the 3 turn cooldown for being forced into the same move for 3 turns. Unless you can set it up with Cleansing Rain for extra damage, it's a rather weak use of turns, which means if you're rolling with Dreadful Breath you want to avoid Call Darkness, because that would lose your Cleansing Rain weather. Again, Death and Decay is somewhat favored over its high damage alternative.<br /><br />On its own, this is a &quot;Cool&quot; pet rather than a &quot;Useful&quot; pet: a half decent tank, but nothing to write home about on the battle front. But then you start to optimize a team around it...<br /><br />Aqua Strider (Water Jet, Cleansing Rain, Soothe)<br />Scourged Whelpling (Tail Sweep, Death and Decay, Dreadful Breath)<br />Anubisath Idol (Crush, Sandstorm, Either final move)<br /><br />And what you get is a very hard to kill team: The strider applies Soothe and then Cleansing Rain, letting you switch in the whelpling against a sleeping foe, at which point Dreadful Breath with extra damage begins to melt the entire enemy team while Death and Decay rots the front pet. the Idol is one of the better tanks in the game: though it clears the Cleansing Rain, it's also nearly invulnerable on its own and can quite easily win pet battles through pure attrition, which will be easier thanks to the massive backline damage the Whelpling will be doing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1Palv</b></h3>I believe the spawn frequency has been changed. When I got mine, it was right after a server reset, and several people were camping the area. Other than right after server reset, I never saw them.<br /><br />Last night, I flew over the area and saw many whelpings and no one was camping them. I even stopped and fought one--poor quality, so I didn't capture it.<br /><br />Now, to check and see if Minfernals have also had the spawn rate adjusted...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1056356</b></h3>I understand that this could be a fluke, but I want to share the experience I just had.<br /><br />This was the last pet I needed for <a href="/achievement=6588/northrend-safari">Northrend Safari</a>, and I had never even seen it, but I was in the area and thought I'd hang out for a few and see if it spawned. Once I had run out of nodes to gather, I just started running around slaughtering the Frostbrood Whelps, and whatever unfortunate cultists got in my way.<br /><br />Within ten minutes I saw two green paws. I told a friend to hurry over and grab one, but somebody else showed up to claim the second one. Once I'd captured mine, I scouted around a bit and quickly found a third.<br /><br />I can't be positive that slaughtering the mobs caused three of these pets to suddenly spawn, but it certainly didn't hurt.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>grodon909</b></h3>I found two of them while passing by Icecrown today (decided I might as well check while I was in the area, its the same reason I got a minfernal). Anyways, once I caught the first one, I wanted to tell my guidlies, but no one was on. I then found another one, and none of my guildies were online to see it. I went into /1 and announced that there was a scoruged whelping flying around. It took a good 3 or so minutes before I even got a reply. <br /><br />The moral of my story here is that it may be worth it to check how many of your guildmates are online, or check /who. A decreased population means that less people are present to capture a whelpling, i.e more whelpings for everyone!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Enthorn</b></h3>I am fairly certain the spawn frequency was changed on this companion. I had never gone out to look for it, but I needed it for <a href="/achievement=6588/northrend-safari">Northrend Safari</a>. Ironically, the last pet I captured was an <a href="/npc=68850/emerald-proto-whelp">Emerald Proto-Whelp</a> which I camped for an hour and a half (with several others also patiently waiting) before any of us saw even one. Here I was reading the comments for Scourged Whelpling and it seemed an even worse wait. But alas, I flew over once and there it was. I swooped down eagerly and grabbed a grey.<br /><br />Then I saw another one, so I told my wife I would hold it for her while she logged in. As she flew toward Sindragosa's Fall, I sat engaged with a green. Then she said never mind, she found another one and she captured it -- a grey, but her first as well. So I promptly captured my second. Then she said she was going to look for a rare. I told her not to bother, being a rare spawn. A second later she exclaimed, &quot;Hah! Got one!&quot; Lo and behold, another had spawned and it was her rare.<br /><br />We both captured four of these -- two greys, a green, and a rare -- in the span of no more than ten minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>monkiebrewster</b></h3>Got mine around 10pm my time (so about 4am server time/PST). The area was full of the frostbrood whelps so I went around and slaughtered as many as I could. After going from one end to the other, I flew back and lo and behold a single scourged whelpling spawned! I managed an uncommon on this spawn of the P/S variety. I was happy enough with this. I really want to use him as my main undead, my other is the eye of the legion which has been really 'meh', so I'm hoping to get a hold of an undead stone to turn him rare. Now just to get a rare type infected squirrel &gt;:)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tempovision</b></h3>Kill frostbrood whelps really helps. I flew around 5 times, no scourged whelps around. I killed all the frostbrood whelps, one scourged was there when i returned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shivacode</b></h3>I don't understand the hubbub. These aren't really rare at all. Trying to find a rare for them is a pain, but they seem to always be up and respawn quickly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>infernosnow</b></h3><u>PS vs HH breed info of a Scourged Whelpling for those intending to Death and Decay + Plagued Blood, then backline the pet or Tail Swipe.</u><br /><br />I did some testing with an Uncommon level 21 HH and an Uncommon level 21 PS. The question to answer was <i>&quot;Does Plagued Blood healing scale with power?&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;If so, is PS better than HH for the extra healing or not?&quot;</i><br /><br /><u>First of all, Plagued Blood does scale with power.</u> Some people have pointed out that it scales with level, but by using a level 21 HH and PS of the same quality, I was able to conclude that it does also scale with power. (and since power goes up with level, it might only be scaling with power, who knows)<br /><br /><b>PS</b><br />Average heal on Tail Swipe hit: 47.9<br />Average heal on DnD hit: 46.47<br /><br /><b>HH</b><br />Average heal on Tail Swipe hit: 50.45<br />Average heal on DnD hit: 50.88<br /><br />These numbers are based off of roughly 50 procs of the heal, which I carefully recorded in a spreadsheet to calculate the averages.<br /><br />Important to know:<br />The healing is based off the power behind Plagued Blood and <u>has nothing to do with the power of the attack used to proc the heal</u>. I figured this out by running the test a second time, but using HH's Plagued Blood and PS's attacks, then vice-versa with PS's Plagued Blood and HH's attacks. What matters is the power of the pet throwing Plagued Blood out. More power = more healing.<br /><br />This means that PS will heal for about 8.5% more per heal. But is that better than the extra health of an HH breed? At level 21 Uncommon,<u> it would take 63 procs of the heal for the PS to heal for as much extra health as the HH breed has. This is because at level 21, the HH has 252 more health and the PS is only getting 4 more hp per heal.</u> So 252/4 = 63 needed procs. With backlining this pet, you only get 1 proc per turn off the DnD, so it would take 63 turns before the PS came out equal to the HH breed. If you didn't backline him to get an extra 2 procs off a double hitting Tail Swipe, it would still take the entire match to come out even.<br /><br />On the flip side, a Tail Swipe hitting harder with more power behind it is nasty and this is the argument for getting a PS breed. The added speed is bad since it means Tail Swipe won't hit twice if you're faster, but the good news is that even with the PS breed, you'll still be slower than most opponents. With 97 level 25's, zero of my magic pets were over the 257 speed mark of a PS Scourged Whelpling (which is what Tail Swipe is super-effective against).<br /><br />As far as healing goes, the HH breed wins by a long shot. It comes down to if you want this pet to tank and heal as HH, backline to heal and deal damage with DnD as HH, or burn down a magic pet with a PS breed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>greenland</b></h3>Did they buff the spawn rate on this guy or something? Everybody is talking about hunting and camping for it. I just used the tournament tabard and caught three of these to cap, all right next to each-other. Took, like, five minutes. &gt;_&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1422900</b></h3>Captured one just today on my way to do the Major Payne daily, he was next to the mountains so check that out, beat a tauren to it just by a few inches, almost killed him with a crit but fortunately got to capture it during its undead round, good luck everyone, and remember to check the area during your daily.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Oktex</b></h3>I think I was lucky, caught my rare after about 3 battles.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Skyplus</b></h3>I got very lucky, I'm on a high populated realm, sylvanas eu. Went to 72.2, 37.6, got there 1 minute late and found one. Wasn't rare, however.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Meeqs</b></h3>Jean-Pierre, who is the Argent Commander that gives you the free flight to the Argent Tournament, no longer does the aforementioned. Instead, you're going to have to use the crystal to be teleported down to the Violet Hold and walk all the way to the scourged whelplings. It's a very long journey and you WILL die multiple times but it's definitely much more efficient than camping the area for hours, or even days. This comment is referring to PinkiePie's strategy for catching a scourged whelpling.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mandams</b></h3>Seems like with WoD the spawns were greatly increased.<br />At 8 am I flew over to the Argent Tournament and I saw a dozen spawns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Grayy</b></h3>I see a lot of posts on here about how people can't find this pet and I thought it was really odd because I think I remember them being all over the place, but it was a long time ago. So I logged on my engineer and took a look. I found three just poking around for 10 minutes at about 9:30pm server time. <br /><br />So I'm not sure if I'm just really really lucky or if they aren't really so 'rare' just just an odd spawn timer or what.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Akefia1</b></h3>When I caught mine, I didn't even realize they were so hard to find. I must have been lucky because I came across a green one randomly as I flew overhead. Now looking at the posts makes me realize how lucky I was to even find one when I wasn't even looking for it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>meldrasbb</b></h3>They must have really increased the spawn rate on these. I went to Sindragosa's Falls area around 70,42 and captured 3 and still saw several others flying around.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>xoMishka</b></h3>Logged on Ysera at 3:12PM realm time and they were up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AveryZan</b></h3>So as of 8/24/2018 I don't see this pet listed in the journal any more. Anyone encounter this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>captainmelwasul</b></h3>So this is only relevant this week, but it seems the Death's Rising event for the Shadowlands pre-patch is messing with the spawns of this pet. I looked all week on my main and nothing, logged into a toon that's too low for the event to trigger, and magic, there's one right away. Either this is a weird coincidence, or Blizz inadvertently made it so they don't spawn when they updated the zone. I submitted a ticket and received an automated response, so I submitted a bug report, hopefully they'll actually read that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>snowqt</b></h3>There are lots of whelps spawning there. If you are hunting for a rare one, it can get quite tedious, as they respawn quite slowly. It probably takes a few hours until all whelps have respawned, after you killed them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>switchxa</b></h3>This took about an hour to find. Was evening on a sunday. Killed some welps in the area and other mobs didn't seem to help. Found a comment on warcraftpets site that mentioned to check the areas in the mountains, did a couple of passes and found one spawned next to the quel'dalar site. Seems to be a stamina contest just to find one to battle in the first place.</div>
