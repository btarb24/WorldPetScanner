Scooter is only an H\/H, but the Shimmershell Snail also has an H\/H breed, and these two have identical stats. So the baseline snails on which the breeds are built are all the same. All five have identical attacks. So only the breeds distinguish the battle value of the fully trained snails.\n\nIt has also been pointed out that the snails are slow, and that even the S\/S lags other battle pets, so speed is a throw-away stat.\n\nSince you have no choice with Scooter, you get an H\/H, avoiding the throw-away stat. The downside of Scooter is he starts as a level 1 uncommon. All of the rest can be caught as a rare.\n\nThe Shimmershell Snail is available as an H\/H, an H\/P, and a B\/B. Avoiding B\/B because of low numbers, some wasted on speed, the H\/H is attractive, but you already have that covered with Scooter. The H\/P is unique among the snails, so is probably the better choice. These also start at a low level; 5 or 6 is typical.\n\nBy the criteria of avoiding speed, getting breeds that spend points elsewhere, those are the two best snails. None of the rest have a breed that avoids speed.\n\nConsider next the Rusty Snail, available as an H\/S, an H\/B, and a B\/B. The H\/B has all the health of the H\/S, and nearly as much attack power as the B\/B; so the H\/B is probably the best choice for this snail. It also starts out fairly low, but a bit higher than the Shimmershell Snail.\n\nThe last two snails have the advantage of being higher level when you catch them, close to max. There is a good chance these will be the first snails you get to level 25.\n\nThe Rapana Whelk is available as an S\/S, an H\/B, and a B\/B. Per the choice for Rusty Snail breed, among these last two snails, the H\/B is the strongest.\n\nThe Silkbead Snail is only available as an H\/S and a B\/B. Ignoring the speed, the health & health vs health & attack power is close. I'd favor the B\/B, but not greatly so.\n\nOne final thought, if you level your breed of choice of each of these to max level, \n\nLevel 25 Rare Scooter the Snail H\/H\nLevel 25 Rare Shimmershell Snail H\/P\nLevel 25 Rare Rusty Snail H\/B\nLevel 25 Rare Rapana Whelk H\/B\nLevel 25 Rare Silkbead Snail B\/B\n\nthe H\/B Rapana Welk no longer stands out; you have two better and one equivalent snail. At that point, it is fairly useless, so I'd consider replacing the Rapana Whelk with the S\/S breed, as the fastest snail. \n\nLevel 25 Rare Scooter the Snail H\/H\nLevel 25 Rare Shimmershell Snail H\/P\nLevel 25 Rare Rusty Snail H\/B\nLevel 25 Rare Rapana Whelk S\/S\nLevel 25 Rare Silkbead Snail B\/B\n\nYes, the fastest snail is still slow, but it does stand out from the herd, and there might be a situation where it proves useful.","date":"2015-12-05T02:27:38-06:00","rating":18,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2015-12-05T14:22:08-06:00",2,"Scoobydeux"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":18,"id":2475893,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Marzen","body":"Update for [b]Warlords of Draenor (and later)[\/b]: these snails are really easy to find in the Spires of Arak.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>phantomeagle</b></h3>I can confirm that this pet is no longer bugged. I got two when Pet Battle first started, to no avail. Just captured a poor one and it counted towards the achievement.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>squiretoad</b></h3>There are very few on that little beach near the Wreck of the Vanguard .. and a hell of a lot of damned monkeys! But one good thing: the little snails do respawn quickly enough, so you might want to just hang around there instead of chasing all over the map hoping for 2ds and 3ds.<br /><br />If you see one down in the water, it may be &quot;battle area obstructed&quot;. So you might as well just go ahead and kill it, so it'll hopefully respawn where you can actually get to it.<br /><br />There are more further down the beach toward the fortress, Garrosh'ar Point .. and no monkeys!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lockexxv</b></h3>So I'm a little confused. I've caught one of these a long time ago in WoD, and now I'm going back for Safari cheeves and it says I need one.. yet can't find one for @#$%all in Pandaria. Help?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Scoobydeux</b></h3>It has been pointed out that there are currently five snail battle pets,<br /><br /><a href="/npc=51635/scooter-the-snail">Scooter the Snail</a><br /><a href="/npc=62246/shimmershell-snail">Shimmershell Snail</a><br /><a href="/npc=62313/rusty-snail">Rusty Snail</a><br /><a href="/npc=64352/rapana-whelk">Rapana Whelk</a><br /><a href="/npc=63001/silkbead-snail">Silkbead Snail</a><br /><br />Four of these have a B/B breed, and these have identical stats. Scooter is only an H/H, but the Shimmershell Snail also has an H/H breed, and these two have identical stats. So the baseline snails on which the breeds are built are all the same. All five have identical attacks. So only the breeds distinguish the battle value of the fully trained snails.<br /><br />It has also been pointed out that the snails are slow, and that even the S/S lags other battle pets, so speed is a throw-away stat.<br /><br />Since you have no choice with Scooter, you get an H/H, avoiding the throw-away stat. The downside of Scooter is he starts as a level 1 uncommon. All of the rest can be caught as a rare.<br /><br />The Shimmershell Snail is available as an H/H, an H/P, and a B/B. Avoiding B/B because of low numbers, some wasted on speed, the H/H is attractive, but you already have that covered with Scooter. The H/P is unique among the snails, so is probably the better choice. These also start at a low level; 5 or 6 is typical.<br /><br />By the criteria of avoiding speed, getting breeds that spend points elsewhere, those are the two best snails. None of the rest have a breed that avoids speed.<br /><br />Consider next the Rusty Snail, available as an H/S, an H/B, and a B/B. The H/B has all the health of the H/S, and nearly as much attack power as the B/B; so the H/B is probably the best choice for this snail. It also starts out fairly low, but a bit higher than the Shimmershell Snail.<br /><br />The last two snails have the advantage of being higher level when you catch them, close to max. There is a good chance these will be the first snails you get to level 25.<br /><br />The Rapana Whelk is available as an S/S, an H/B, and a B/B. Per the choice for Rusty Snail breed, among these last two snails, the H/B is the strongest.<br /><br />The Silkbead Snail is only available as an H/S and a B/B. Ignoring the speed, the health &amp; health vs health &amp; attack power is close. I'd favor the B/B, but not greatly so.<br /><br />One final thought, if you level your breed of choice of each of these to max level, <br /><br />Level 25 Rare Scooter the Snail H/H<br />Level 25 Rare Shimmershell Snail H/P<br />Level 25 Rare Rusty Snail H/B<br />Level 25 Rare Rapana Whelk H/B<br />Level 25 Rare Silkbead Snail B/B<br /><br />the H/B Rapana Welk no longer stands out; you have two better and one equivalent snail. At that point, it is fairly useless, so I'd consider replacing the Rapana Whelk with the S/S breed, as the fastest snail. <br /><br />Level 25 Rare Scooter the Snail H/H<br />Level 25 Rare Shimmershell Snail H/P<br />Level 25 Rare Rusty Snail H/B<br />Level 25 Rare Rapana Whelk S/S<br />Level 25 Rare Silkbead Snail B/B<br /><br />Yes, the fastest snail is still slow, but it does stand out from the herd, and there might be a situation where it proves useful.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Marzen</b></h3>Update for <b>Warlords of Draenor (and later)</b>: these snails are really easy to find in the Spires of Arak. Don't bother hunting back in Pandaria.</div>
