We've ruled out that they are linked to the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=61375">Restless Shadling</a> which is limited to 'Early Morning', and thus they are single pets in that no other pets will join them when battling.<br /><br />Now that their demand as settled, it is easier to find them. It's not unheard of to arrive at Karazhan and see 5 of them available all around the haunted keep.<br /><br /><a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7200062111?page=2#24" rel="nofollow">Blue post</a> says <div class="quote-box">The new pets are on fairly long spawn timers, and are randomized (i.e. will not spawn on server restart).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maizou</b></h3>After sitting outside kara for about 10 minutes, I found 2.<br /><br />They seem to have a relatively short respawn, and are found outside Kara, ABOVE GROUND. Although the blue said all the pets have a long respawn, these seem to respawn at the rate of 1 every 10-15 minutes, which, for a pet, is actually not long at all.<br /><br />They are also single-spawns like the Shadelings, as in, there are no secondary pets in the battles. These also spawn on the terrace slightly up on Kara. It's not too far up, it's the first &quot;Balcony&quot;. There's 2 spawn points up there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jayrai</b></h3>I found my first one right outside Kara, near the summoning stone.<br />I found my second on top of Kara just above the raid entrance, to the left on a little round platform.<br />This was roughly 7pm server time, if that helps.<br />When they spawn, a lot of them seem to spawn at the same time.<br /><br />Cool pet, I really like it. Easy fight! It doesn't bring any buddies, it fights solo just like the Restless Shadeling. So if you don't have any pets of this level, you should be fine with three level 10-11s. I helped my fiance get one last night and he only had three level 10's (two were gray quality). Only took two, to find myself a rare quality!<br />Does pretty good damage against flying pets.<br /><br />Happy hunting :)<br /><br />I'm not sure if there is a specific time of day for these to spawn. I've seen them all over the place at many different times of day. 3pm, 5pm, 7pm and 4am.<br />I battle the pet master there daily, and usually see many of them floating around.<br /><br />Arcane Eye also follows behind you as you fly around on a flying mount!</div>

PLEASE be kind and alt f4 out or /logout so others can get this pet ^_^<br /><br />Edit2: Camped them for a few days on and off (usually the times I noted) they seem to spawn in small groups, some times large groups, some on kara, and literally all around Kara(front back-both sides). Finally found a rare, gave it to a friend who's been trying to find one for weeks, 2nd one spawned and was a rare as well! Goodluck all!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1018188</b></h3><u>Quality Hunters and Collectors</u><br /><br />It seems, like most things, the two sides are dead set in their way being <b>the way</b>. Generally speaking I do not care if someone goes from wild battle to wild battle in search of a rare. It only bothers me when it is done with rare critters and <b>they know</b> other people are there at the same time and are after the pet (of any quality) for their collection.<br /><br />On one hand, quality hunters who know someone is after the pet (of any quality) could be nice and /camp out of a battle that they would otherwise simply KO. A simple /yell &quot;&lt;quality&gt;&lt;rare pet&gt; near &lt;location&gt;&quot; and move on. If the spawn is still there in about 5-10 minutes, they have every reason to wipe it out.<br /><br />On the other hand, if collectors do not speak up (&quot;Hey folks, looking to tame any quality of &lt;pet&gt;. If you happen across one please don't KO it!&quot; ) then they really have no reason to complain if a quality hunter is in the area and knocking out all of the rares. But seeing as most 'collectors' will not be kind to quality hunters and /camp out of a battle and announce &quot;Rare quality &lt;pet&gt; at &lt;location&gt;!&quot; I do not believe they have a right to get so upset over the issue.</div>

Went back at 11:30pm and there were shed loads of them (around 10) all over the place. Captured 3, including a rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Teevo</b></h3>Never had a problem finding these outside of Kara, but man I couldn't find a rare version for the life of me. Took me atleast 80-90 before getting my rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tuctuc</b></h3>They made this pet some what difficult to obtain even more so with the shadling if you not 70+ due to the ghosts around the area. As I said it's difficult but not impossible I mangad to snag at least two rare eyes with very few deaths on my lvl 54 warlock was even able to reach the battle pets master.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xistt</b></h3>As I have battled Grand Master Lydia Accoste, I have tried to circle the area, looking for Arcane Eyes. I actually try to keep my gametime to a minimum, so I was surprised to forfeit a match because the pet was grey, only to have it respawn within seconds, while all of my pets took damage.<br /><br />So, I started killing them instead.<br /><br />I logged in tonight and have never seen that many Arcane Eyes at once. I quickly found a blue, having tried on and off for a few weeks, and the very next pet was blue! It was not long before I had three and there were still several more Arcane Eyes in the area.<br /><br />They must have changed things in a big way!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rj23</b></h3>I went for the Shadling after the server reset. There were plenty of both around Kara. I fought every Shadling, just over 30, and found one rare. The Arcane Eye caught my eye, so fought 3 before I got my rare. Cute little thing!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ripping</b></h3>As of 5.2, these are a splendid means of levelling pets and alts together. Single, not too challenging opponents dispatched quickly, while your toon also benefits. Post lvl 85, I earned up to 100k exp per battle. Not too shabby, and makes a change from grinding or questing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1129896</b></h3>Went to deadwind pass and saw like 10 of these, after like 4 kills, went to the next one, then boom, a rare one :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>298971</b></h3>&quot;Big Brother&quot;, perfect name for this pet. George Orwell would like that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wazdakka</b></h3>Because only one fights you at a time, you can use massively underleveled pets to capture them or kill them for good experience thanks to the difficulty bonus. <br /><br />I captured 2 lvl 17s with little fuss using a lvl 10 Willy, 11 Sinister Squashling, and a lvl 12 crow. That said, they were low health after each battle, so bring a second team or a higher level pet to help. That said, RNG with trapping and missing can help or hinder you.<br /><br />They spawn everywhere around Karazhan, in the ruins, in the tower near the instance, around the lake and stream, and along the path.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TomTheMage</b></h3>You can name it &quot;Verdant Sphere&quot; if you are a caster. Makes for awesome rp epeen.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1221066</b></h3>I did not see if anyone mention the fact that these pets along with Restless Shadelings are really good for levelling an alt if you are bored with the pandaria quests and don't want to kill hundreds of mobs on timeless isle. Both of these pets come alone but they are level 17-18 so they give a decent amount of xp if you defeat them with a level 14-15 pet. I found that the arcane eyes are easier to kill cause their abilites are just not that good + even with the magic racial, they still die pretty fast. <br /><br />I used this method to level 3 alts like this so far from level 85 to level 90, you can get a level out of them with 1-1.5 hour played (depending on the pets you use and the amount of pets there are). In my experience, i had to defeat around 90 pets to get a level, they give around 1.5 times the xp of the level appropriate zone's quests.<br /><br />I wonder if in WoD, this will still be a valid method to level a character cause this is just much quicker than questing (of course only if you care about the played time, not the actual speed cause it takes around a week to level a character like this if you check them) not to mention the fact that you won't get ganked that much.<br /><br />A little advice if you want to try this: use level 13-14 pets with a decent attacking ability and if it reaches level 18-19 just switch to another pet cause then they don't give that much xp.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1048480</b></h3>I'm not so sure time matters much anymore as to catching these. Yesterday I logged in just before 3pm server time and there were half a dozen floating around--finally got my rare. Again, today around 7:30am server time there were plenty. Restless shadelings, though, do seem time-dependent. A dozen of them this morning, none in the afternoon or evening yesterday. Rare on the first try--happy happy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>772824</b></h3>Just found my first Arcane Eye by the destroyed houses near the Entrance on the Galakrond server. The spawn was roughly 30 minutes and only 1 was found. gg rng gods &gt;.&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rakkasan</b></h3>Nerfed? been checking the zone for hours and there's zero battle pet spawns of any kind.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rathux</b></h3>If you wonder how early these actually spawn, I'd like to add that I just captured one now at 05:50 realm time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>benx2011</b></h3>These pets are really good against Flyers. It is one of my major pets in most battles, especially in WoD where most Pet masters' pets are flyers or at least has a flyer. With Arcane Wind, Mana Surge deals insane damage to Flyers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vynathlon</b></h3>Awww! Look at the cute floating eye monster! He's adorable!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Eekwibble</b></h3>Mechanical pets do best against these.<br /><br />I just used a trio of lvl 5 <a href="/npc=69778/sunreaver-micro-sentry">Sunreaver Micro-Sentry</a>'s to capture one uncommon lvl 17 and two common lvl 16's. Took them to Dragonblight to catch three <a href="/npc=62852/dragonbone-hatchling">Dragonbone Hatchling</a>'s and a <a href="/npc=61312/strand-crab">Strand Crab</a> - lvl 22/23 - now I'm in Vale of Eternal Blossoms fighting lvl 25 <a href="/npc=61088/eternal-strider">Eternal Strider</a>'s to lvl up to 25. So glad I found the tips on the Blizz forum. It's a crazy-fast way to lvl up your first pet/s to 25.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Verhoevix</b></h3>It's a blue Sam! :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>treble54</b></h3>Spent 1.5 - 2 hours looking for one. Started around 10pm server time. Did not see a single one. I only searched around the Karazhan tower, outside and on balconies. Am I doing something wrong? Several comments here seem to imply that most people come across them eventually.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wruen</b></h3>For anyone having trouble getting these, here's a pro-tip that I use with hard to find pets: Make a DK on Tol Barad in Brazil. Lowest pop server, no competition for rare/highly farmed pets. Works for Infinite Whelping and Minfernal as well. It is a pvp server, so you might get taken out a time or two, but the time spent getting out of the starting zone and making a few corpse runs is so much better than endless hours of waiting on your home server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TheCatTrillo</b></h3>A better pro-tip. You can't see them unless war-mode is off ;)</div>
