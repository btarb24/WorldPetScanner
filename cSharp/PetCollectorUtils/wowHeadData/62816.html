Saw one right outside of Nesingwary's Expedition. Short legs make for an awkward walk on this little guy. (5.04)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lynkyn</b></h3>I'm using my farming druid to farm mats for my Inscriptionist Warlock and saw one in Scholozar basin. Well it was yellow and there was no indication that you tamed it. I killed it thinking it dropped something, it doesn't drop anything.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>64303</b></h3>Searching the companion tab for this little guy does bring up a battle pet. Will most likely be able to &quot;hunt&quot; him after MoP</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wolfwings</b></h3>These spawn with a 'parent' and hang around them.<br /><br />These also have a tendency to spawn inside trees.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>441560</b></h3>It looks like its respawn time is very, very slow at this time. It might be a patch (5.0.5) issue, but I'm not sure.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>princessehri</b></h3>The baby shardhorn has a total of ten horns on its head. Very stumpy and adorable when it attempts to follow its owner on his or her adventures.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Random33698</b></h3>Did some experimentation, seems that if you kill the shardhorn rhinos, you can force a spawn of the little battle pets. I was able to do this repeatedly for about an hour.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mantrhax</b></h3><u><b>&quot;Interact with target&quot;</b></u><br /><br />For those who do not know how to proceed,to set this keybind (Interact with target) , bring up World of Warcraft's main Options menu (hitting Escape will bring it up), go to the Key Bindings menu, scroll down to Targeting Functions, and you should be able to find &quot;Interact with target&quot; easily. You can also set an Interact With Mouseover key bind if you so choose. <br /><br />Good Luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Donnicton</b></h3>These little guys have an <i>obscene</i> amount of attack power, but noticeably low base speed. If you capture one that's weighted towards attack, and pair it with another pet that can increase its speed(i.e. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=366">Dazzling Dance</a>), you can create an absolute terror.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>4Tr3Yu</b></h3>this guys hit like a truck, u can easy power lvl other pets with this guys. Near the BMAH there are a lot of critters to oneshot and there is a stable master there too</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Emmamental</b></h3>I've been in SB for about half an hour. In that time I have seen only one of these guys. Luckily I managed to trap it (uncommon quality). I have killed all sorts and can confirm that nothing has (so far) made any more spawn. <br /><br />Very cute though! I caught mine with my clefthoof runt as part of the team and it was hilarious watching these two stumpy legged things fight it out!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>223389</b></h3>I have found a way to move the Stunted Shardhorn if it is stuck inside a tree. You need a Priest to Mind Control a non battle-pet critter. Use that critter to attack the Stunted Shardhorn with one hit and it will run away outside the tree. Then release your critter and battle the Stunted Shardhorn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1043431</b></h3>Well thanks to you guys I got this one today with little trouble indeed!<br /><br />I found a half dozen or so roaming around in the open, all were poors and commons, so I went for the ones in the tree trunks-<br /><br />Just walk up to a tree trunk- Type: tar/stunted<br />and then I set the middle mouse button (when you press down the wheel) to &quot;Interact with Target&quot; in the keybindings section<br /><br />the first one I targeted was so deep in the tree nothing I could do would start a battle .... (so I shot the little sucker) HA<br /><br />second one I went up to tree, targeted him and clicked the mouse wheel and it was a RARE! WOOT!<br /><br />Thanks again fellow WoW-heads!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>545160</b></h3>Got there and circled the whole area. Not a single one to be seen. Stuck around n killed around 20 rhinos n one popped up. Was a rare one too. My lucky day =D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>223389</b></h3>I have been killing these throughout the expansion and have never seen a rare. Probably 50 battles.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pynks</b></h3>Cannot find one not stuck in the base of a tree. Are these really supposed to be rare? Killed the &quot;adult&quot; shardhorns in the circle several times and have not see one spawn.<br /><br />Im really starting to feel like CRZ is the worst idea Blizzard has ever had. At times there should be less people camping rare spawns, there are more campers because more zones end up combined in the same CRZ.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kawney</b></h3>High Spawn rate - Why are they rare? Most spawn in trees.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vexious</b></h3>Okay, so I wana clear some things up with people.<br /><br />First of all this applies to patch 5.1<br /><br />Secondly, This pet can be spawned easier when killing other critters in the area (snakes and squirles) as it too is a critter and not an actual map NPC, like the adult rhinos are.<br /><br />Lastly, The majority will spawn inside of the base of a tree... this is blizzards mess up, so dont worry too much about it. Make a macro with &quot;/target stunted&quot; as the command, and spam that mother when you see one in the tree and hope it starts the battle, should it say that the view is obstructed or whatever, face away from the tree and re-target it, this worked a total of 4/6 tries for me...<br /><br />Some do however wonder around on their lonesome, I have not however caught a rare one yet, I want one cause they're Att dmg ratio's are godlike lol, but I did get an uncommon. <br /><br />Dont forget to kill them if they are in a tree and you have tried all possible options to get them out by battling them.<br /><br />Good luck and Happy hunting!(##RESPBREAK##)8##DELIM##ElhonnaDS##DELIM##</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1061491</b></h3>Wheres the best place to level one up once you catch a rare quality kind?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>pmakaro</b></h3>For those that are having trouble with ones spawning in trees make sure you have an &quot;Interact With Mouseover&quot; bound to a key. It won't pull all of them out but it will get most.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1071299</b></h3>Didn't have any troubles with getting this little guy ...plenty of them there when i checked for the first time ^.^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Znaleziatko</b></h3>It was an easy catch for me. Plenty of them hanging around (exactly as the map here shows), the third-fourth I battled was already a rare.<br />What's also worth mentioning - they have many different helpers as secondary pets, got myself a rare squirrel (took it because it had a higher level that the one I've had) and a rare biletoad while fighting the shardhorn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zatie</b></h3>For those of you that have seen them spawn in tree tunks - did the green paw print still come up on the mini map?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>315859</b></h3>PIKACHU! THE HORN!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>689737</b></h3>If they are stuck in the tree, just use /target Stunted Shardhorn and make sure you have Interact with Target in the Key Bindings set to a button. Move up against the tree and turn your back to it. You may have to do this in a few different places, but this will allow you to avoid the &quot;Battle Area Obstructed&quot; error. Hope this helps out a few people.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Berbe</b></h3>so i've tried that attack thru tree but nothing happened...tried it multiple times but no luck but killed all taunted ones inside, and when i finally got my Interract with Target button set didnt even got time to use it because one just spawned out of the trees...so i guess they can make it out some times.. :) don't know how often but mine spawned after 5 min of farming it. might take longer tho for others. as for Turtles all the way down...some get them from 10 casts, and some from 10k casts.. but thing is they spawn out of the trees too :) and had the luck to get a rare one from begging :) ......Post edited: Found another one that spawned out of trees....after i went back in game.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Giliathriel</b></h3>This pet is AMAZING. He hits hard and he's got hitpoints like a tank. When Smash is used in conjunction with Trumpet Strike, this guy nukes. I've been doing the Pandaren Spirit Tamers dailies, and often this pet will take out nearly two pets before he goes down. I highly recommend getting a rare. He's also great for powerleveling other pets since he ends fights quickly. As a side note, I'm working with breed 6.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>893306</b></h3>repop too long ?<br /><br />U must understand rhinos must feel very comfortable for reprod to occur:<br /><br />As usual clear all criters af the zone specially including that little birds they carry on their nose.<br />Ofc who could do it with a bird on the nose ? (Other admitted theory is that rhinos r allready way too much in love with that nosebird to think to anything else more adequate... just in doubt, kill it anyway)<br /><br />Still no repop ?<br />Kill then all zone tigers, that make perfect sense that rhinos mama and papa must be too scared by this predators.<br /><br />Well well damn no repop again ...<br />Nuke the entire zone and come back 2days later maybe blibli will have fixed the pb</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>2picnic</b></h3>This guy turns huge for some reason if you use a pet biscuit on him, he's big to begin with but he could easily pass for a hunter pet afterwards.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cierona</b></h3>While wowhead doesn't show it, these are also available as P/P.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hordella</b></h3>Has anyone caught a rare? I've looked many times over the years, even today I checked over 100 and no rares! Shrug...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PollyJean19</b></h3>is there a mount to match this pet, other than the trading-card one?</div>
