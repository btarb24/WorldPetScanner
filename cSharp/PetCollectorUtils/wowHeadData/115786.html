<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Potatochip</b></h3>Food in bags..killed Matriarch, used provided script and got back 'true', located Orphan, spoke with Orphan and offered food, chat window closed and my toon 'shimmered' like a completed a quest or achievement..<br /><br />But that's all that happened...I didn't get the pet. I check bags, checked my pet journal...nada.<br /><br />Edit: So, figured out the problem, at least the initial problem...I'd unknowingly cap'd out my Pet Journal at 1k pets..so, even though I did everything right, my full journal wouldn't allow me to actually learn the pets. I've fixed that issue..but I'm still struggling to get the Orphans to spawn for me again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Constrictors</b></h3>Not sure if it's bugged or if there is a lock out of some kind for having other hatchlings already, but this one will not spawn for me.<br /><br />What I know: <br /><br />Killing solo, or with others ganking makes no difference in spawn. I got the Bloodgazer and Snowfeather hatchlings with dozens involved from both factions, with no issues.<br /><br />World quest completion means nothing. My Bloodgazer spawned after completion, my Snowfeather spawned having only completed 14% of the quest.<br /><br />This one is not spawning for me regardless. Killed the matriarch during WQ, and after completion; no spawn and the handy script posted in this thread returned &quot;false&quot; both times. First kill during WQ had three others helping, second kill after completion was a solo kill. <br /><br />My other two hatchlings are each on their third quest. <br /><br />So... does anyone know if there is a glitch on this one, or is there is a lockout preventing you from leveling all four simultaneously?<br /><br />Knowing Blizz, I'm betting on the latter.<br /><br />EDIT: Ugh... Decided to kill her again before leaving the area(again, solo and WQ completed) annnnd... spawned. Whatever, I'm taking my hatchling and going home. lol!<br /><br />Just keep trying is the moral of the story I guess.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JusticarCien</b></h3>For any of you who were good with alts in Warlords of Draenor, yet neglected your pet battling! I have exciting news for you!<br />Level 3 Garrisons will allow you to pick up <a href="/item=122457/ultimate-battle-training-stone">Ultimate Battle-Training Stone</a> from <a href="/npc=85418/lio-the-lioness">Lio the Lioness</a>, the quest you need to do is <a href="/quest=38241/unearthed-magic">Unearthed Magic</a>/<a href="/quest=38242/unearthed-magic">Unearthed Magic</a> and only involves you running to the entrance of your Garrison mine. Easy.<br /><br />Just make sure you start the quest for each hatchling on a level 110 character (I say this because my sneaky level 25 stone abuse alts were only 100), and log over to your alt, summon your desired hatchling, and right-click the stone directly on to the summoned baby raptor. Voila. You can complete the quest on the alt if you so desire for some XP.<br /><br />Edit: It may also be worth noting that you can bank your <a href="/item=122457/ultimate-battle-training-stone">Ultimate Battle-Training Stone</a> from <a href="/quest=39042/the-very-best">The Very Best</a> during the Pet Battle Week Holiday if you haven't caught all four hatchlings yet, and if you haven't got stones left from your Garrisons.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tale</b></h3>You have to LOOT the Matriarch to spawn the pet. I killed her and ran right over to the spot, no pet. Waited maybe 30 seconds, ran back to the Matriarch's corpse and while watching the spawn spot I saw the pet spawn simultaneously with my looting the Matriarch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thannya</b></h3>So, this was the last one for me today. I went to matriarch spot, she was not there, killed and not yet spawned, but hatchling was on little hill behind her, so, I just picked it up. I don't know was it a bug or what...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>moofox6</b></h3>Be mindful of your pet count, if you are maxed at 1,000 (barring having the item to raise the limit), you will be able to feed the hatchling, but will never beable to catch him. I contacted support, and they said to simply do it on another character.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>317714</b></h3>Instead of waiting on the cooldown between the quests these pets give, simply log on to another max-level character and accept the quest on it. They are account-wide quests and the cooldown can be skipped this way.<br /><br />Also, not every waiting period is a day. After turning in the &quot;go to exodar&quot; quest I got the next to kill critters in Azsuna after about an hour.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Weasei</b></h3>As of Patch 7.1 there are 4 new Falcosaur pets. Each of the pets is associated with a different world quest around the Broken Isles. These pets all provide a quest chain to obtain a different mount. These quest chains require a couple of weeks to complete as each subsequent quest becomes available from your summoned pet after the daily reset after completing the previous quest.<br /><br />To get each pet, you must first kill the Matriarch in the world quest area, which will cause the NPC version of the pet to spawn. The next step is to go to the NPC and interact with it and feed it its favourite food. If you don't have the food, you won't obtain the pet. There are vendors selling the required foods at the closest flightpaths to each world quest for most of these so just remember to pick some up on your way there!<br /><br />Important note on orphans: I've encountered issues with the orphans not spawning after killing the matriarch. This isn't affected by the matriarch's nest but it does seem to be affected by getting the last hit on the matriarch. If you can't see the orphan after killing the matriarch then you may need to wait for the respawn. To check if you have completed the requirements to see the orphan run the scripts below.<br /><br /><b><a href="/npc=115784/snowfeather-hatchling">Snowfeather Hatchling</a></b> - <a href="/quest=44892/snowfeather-swarm">Snowfeather Swarm!</a><br />This pet can be picked up from <a href="/npc=115737/orphaned-snowfeather">Orphaned Snowfeather</a> in Highmountain (/way Highmountain 32.5, 28.2) after killing the <a href="/npc=115673/snowfeather-matriarch">Snowfeather Matriarch</a> (/way Highmountain 35.1, 21.9).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>IndigloRaver</b></h3>As an aside - I used Ultimate Battle Stones on all 4 Hatchlings, and started the chain(s) today. I was able to complete the &quot;take them to a capital city for x race&quot; quest on all 4, on the same day, on the same character I got them on (I only have 1 110, which is my main).<br /><br />If they let you work all 4 mounts at the same time, that would be awesome! :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ropiv</b></h3>Seems you have to kill the Matriarch when it is next to one of the nests, and then loot both the Matriarch and the nest. Several kills without the nest present resulted in &quot;false&quot; when I ran the script.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Concealed17</b></h3>You can complete multiple dailies for each pet as long as you have multiple level 110's. If you complete the quest where you have to bring the pet to one of the town inns and then log onto another max level character and summon the pet it will offer you the next quest in the chain.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gird</b></h3>Note: you are able to complete the daily quests for these pets with your level 110 main, but then logout and turn them in for Experience as a lower-level alt!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TryChick</b></h3>So I thought i was getting more than 4 hatchlings as I had the food on me and it appeared I adopted others, but they don't show up in my pet journal...Are we only allowed one of each type?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SylviaDragon</b></h3>You can complete the objectives on your main then turn them in on a low level character and <b>the xp will not scale.</b><br />without heirlooms its roughly 16k xp per quest regardless of the characters level. with my full set of looms (minus the rings, still missing them) it came to about 25k xp per quest. So if you have been wanting an alt but are not looking forward to the first few levels/starting zones this is a great way to boost yourself to a decent level while keeping your alt on a back burner for later.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Muchomurka</b></h3>All those hatchlings are Unique, so you can obtain only one of each species! Even if you kill Matriarch and feed orphan on your alt, you wont receive another pet!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aardbeiensap</b></h3>Seems like they hotfixed the fact you can get new quests on your alts, or is that just me?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Deien</b></h3>I see comments here about not having to kill the Matriarch or even tag/hit her. Those people see the orphan spawn, feed it, and pick it up. <br />My comment to that: <br />I killed the Matriarch and went to the Orphan's spawn point on my mini map. As I approached my way-point I watched another player take the orphan. <br />No other orphan spawned and I eventually killed the Matriarch again before the world quest expired to get one for me. <br />I wonder if people think about the fact that something made that item spawn; when you picked it up without doing the required steps it does not mean you &quot;got lucky&quot;, it means you took it from someone that did the work to get it to spawn.<br />I am thinking THAT is the reason others commenting here had to re-kill the Matriarch because &quot;their's did not spawn&quot;. It probably did!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Fetkosh</b></h3>Rule #1: Don't forgett to pull your hatchling out.<br />Rule #2: Don't forgett to pull your hatchling out!<br />Rule #3: Don't forgett to pull that stupid hatchling out!<br /><br />Awww... it despawned again!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vruko</b></h3>Just an FYI, Having the same color pet and mount out spawns a &quot;Heart&quot; emote between them....awwww</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gunsotsu</b></h3>at max level the daily quests for your falcosaurs appear to not be functional. defeatd 3/3 pet battle world quests got 0 credit.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aedna</b></h3>If these pets won't give you their quests once you've acquired them, you probably haven't learned pet battling. This can be learned from the pet battle trainer in Stormwind or Orgrimmar. I didn't get the quest for weeks, opened a ticket and this is what a gamemaster told me to do. Upon learning pet battling, I had to relog, and once I logged in they offered me the quest!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>huspomike</b></h3>I looked and looked, and did not find anyone answering the question: May we capture/acquire more than one (1) or each type? I'm in the middle of collecting, and just found Blizz Inc's patch which will let you get 1500 pets instead of 1000 pets. I would prefer two (2) or three (3) of many of these types, as they are so utile in the Battle Dungeons. May we get more than 1?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ye7i</b></h3>I have been able to complete multiple dailies for each hatchling during the same day by using alt characters. At first, I thought this method required an alt from another faction, but it doesn't seem to matter as I did more testing.<br /><br />Important Note: Accept and complete the dailies on one character first, then move to an alt and summon the hatchlings again to get the next set of dailies during the same day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>favebook</b></h3>If you are using <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=122457/ultimate-battle-training-stone">Ultimate Battle-Training Stone</a> on your pets while the quest is active, it may not auto-complete. Relogging/reloading, dismissing the pet or changing to an alt may not auto-complete either. Resolution is to abandon the quest and take it again - it will auto-complete instantly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Inkjoy7</b></h3>So, I dropped the quest that goes with the Sharptalon Hatchling and couldn't find a way to get it back. I relogged, reset, turned off my add-ons, pet battled with the Sharptalon to convince it that it was indeed a level 25 pet, and was about to open a ticket, when I thought....<br /><br />Hey....<br /><br />So I logged on with another character and summoned my little Sharptalon Hatchling....<br /><br />Bingo! He promptly gave me the quest &quot;The Smell of Night Elves&quot; and it is now accepted and done.<br /><br />I think I could have gone back and gotten the quest with the alt who is doing the other 3 Hatchling quest chains, but...I didn't.<br /><br />Also, there seems to be some confusion about whether or not the quests can be completed any faster than one a day. the answer is NO. Each quest in the chain can only be done ONE PER DAY. But you don't have to do them every day in a row...so no panic if you miss a day. You will just pick up where you left off.<br /><br />Good Luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LargeMarge</b></h3>Not mentioned in most of these posts, you find the xxxxx Matriarch by first completing a Falcosaur world quest (xxxxx Swarm, objective: cull falcosaurs).<br />The Hatchling will not appear until it's Matriarch appears.<br />If you do not see world quests on your map, then you have quite a few quests to complete before you can pursue the Matriarchs or their Hatchlings.
