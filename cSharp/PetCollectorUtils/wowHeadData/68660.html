In my opinion, this is the best ooze pet in the game. I felt so lucky when I saw it drop! \r\n\r\nHere's a few tips: Enchant Weapon - Elemental Force causes elemental damage that counts as frost on Viscidus, so if you don't have any frost-based abilities (as I did not), this is a life-saver. With a fast attack speed, it should only take a few minutes for Viscidus to freeze. Shattering him is the hard part.\r\n\r\nI suggest bringing him down to 1 health, waiting for him to freeze, and then putting everything you have into fast melee attacks. You have to hit him a certain number of times for him to shatter while frozen, and if you can't do that then Viscidus will just thaw every time and HE WILL NEVER DIE.\r\n\r\nI do not know the actual number of hits required, but I know you will need either a very fast attack speed and spammable abilities, or summoned minions. Preferably both. As a druid, I tried and failed multiple times using Force of Nature. I finally waited for my energy to fill completely and then as soon as he froze, I dropped my treants, spammed only Mangle, refilled my energy with Tiger's Fury, and had beforehand made sure to get my attack speed to 0.80. It worked. \r\n\r\nSo happy hunting, and I hope this helps.","date":"2012-11-29T14:25:16-06:00","rating":4,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":3,"id":1773054,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"wilosoft","body":"Just got it on my first run since the updated patch, I didn't see I got it until I went back to Stormwind and started vendoring the trash I had & stumbled upon an item I couldn't sell, I checked it and it was the pet xD I was so happy ^^ it's level 15 already :>","date":"2012-12-01T12:08:19-06:00","rating":-2,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":4,"id":1776142,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"brothernads","body":"For those wondering about the drop rate, Blizzard recently posted a little more detail.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>villainae</b></h3>Well, unless Blizzard changes the mechanics for Viscidus, you'll likely need several people with you to even try to get this pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Soulerous</b></h3>Got mine today; soloed as a level 86 feral druid. In my opinion, this is the best ooze pet in the game. I felt so lucky when I saw it drop! <br /><br />Here's a few tips: Enchant Weapon - Elemental Force causes elemental damage that counts as frost on Viscidus, so if you don't have any frost-based abilities (as I did not), this is a life-saver. With a fast attack speed, it should only take a few minutes for Viscidus to freeze. Shattering him is the hard part.<br /><br />I suggest bringing him down to 1 health, waiting for him to freeze, and then putting everything you have into fast melee attacks. You have to hit him a certain number of times for him to shatter while frozen, and if you can't do that then Viscidus will just thaw every time and HE WILL NEVER DIE.<br /><br />I do not know the actual number of hits required, but I know you will need either a very fast attack speed and spammable abilities, or summoned minions. Preferably both. As a druid, I tried and failed multiple times using Force of Nature. I finally waited for my energy to fill completely and then as soon as he froze, I dropped my treants, spammed only Mangle, refilled my energy with Tiger's Fury, and had beforehand made sure to get my attack speed to 0.80. It worked. <br /><br />So happy hunting, and I hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wilosoft</b></h3>Just got it on my first run since the updated patch, I didn't see I got it until I went back to Stormwind and started vendoring the trash I had &amp; stumbled upon an item I couldn't sell, I checked it and it was the pet xD I was so happy ^^ it's level 15 already :&gt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>brothernads</b></h3>For those wondering about the drop rate, Blizzard recently posted a little more detail. CM Brennvin said the following on a forum post (I added the bold font):<br /><br />&quot;We believe there was a lot of confusion when we originally announced this change and we're certainly at fault for said confusion. The original patch note was very vague to the point of being misleading. It was never our intent to weaken old raid boss encounters to allow anyone to have a chance to solo them, regardless of class, spec, or skill. <br /><br />What we did change were encounters that were mechanically impossible for one person to accomplish, solely for the purpose of ensuring players have easier access to the hunt for the new rare companion pets -- <b>the drop rates of which are actually set to account for a group of three players, not one.</b><br /><br />Moving forward, though, we do not plan to adjust encounters for tougher raid bosses to be soloâ€™able by all classes and specs.&quot;<br /><br />(Source: <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7199913648?page=3#58" rel="nofollow">http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7199913648?page=3#58</a>)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>376514</b></h3>I can confirm that as a feral druid using JUST a full bar of energy, Berserk and a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=43600">Brunnhildar Harpoon</a>, you can shatter Viscidus. Only costs a couple gold and a trip out to SP. Fight him as normal to get him down to 1 HP. Once he's at 1 HP, switch to the harpoon and freeze him. That's when you blow Berserk and spam anything and everything you've got. You'll get enough hits in to shatter him, without needing to buy even frost oil or anything else. This was as a L87 feral druid, as well, which means that you don't need to accumulate an immense amount of haste either. All you need is a harpoon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>810141</b></h3>Mage Strategy (currently I use a main dagger / offhand.. I'm uncertain if that makes a difference vs staff):<br /><br />1. DPS down to 1 percent.<br />2. <a href="/spell=30455/ice-lance">Ice Lance</a> until blue<br />3. Start smacking him with your dagger<br />4. <a href="/spell=30455/ice-lance">Ice Lance</a> until frozen<br />5. Pop <a href="/spell=80353/time-warp">Time Warp</a> + <a href="/item=89611/quilen-statuette">Quilen Statuette</a> (I'm sure we can find similar trinkets here)<br />6. Combined you should do enough hits<br /><br />I start hitting him with my dagger early and split up the ice lance attacks to try and get in as many hits as possible. Haven't checked how close I have come to failing, but it works every time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Qoko</b></h3>Not to be extremely picky, but why all the solo-ing strategies on this page about the pet rather than the boss <a href="/npc=15299/viscidus">Viscidus</a>?<br /><br />I'll be frank though, talking about the pet itself is not extremely interesting. You can make a magic/beast/aquatic hybrid at leisure whilst being magic himself, but this does not pose a very efficient pet against any type of pet. <br /><br />Weakness is the only ability worth of noting: with two more available pets of which one is a promotional one, this pet might a worthy contestant for legendary killing, reducing their effective damage by 75% (if this is used every single time on cooldown) in combination with the magic passive effect.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gbalkam</b></h3>I am actually curious about this battle pet. It seems he has several different attacks, each strong against a different type of enemy. In theory.. provided it could stand a couple hits, 3 of these in a battle would be like playing God Mode. <br /><br />I do the raid pretty much weekly, if I get a couple more (had 2 already, sold one) I may try it.<br /><br />I am also curious about how badly geared a level 90 has to be, to be making posts about how they soloed a level 1 battle pet. Usually I kill a whole group of level 1 pets in the wild, just by incidental AoE while fighting something else. If you wanted to impress me, go to the boss page and tell me how you soloed that. :o)</div>
