When wild pets are caught or killed in the zone, it frees up a spot for a new spawn to appear somewhere on the map. Because there are more 'normal' pet nodes in a zone, it is more likely that a 'normal' battle pet will spawn, with a smaller chance to spawn at the 'rarer' spawns. But it seems with enough catches\/kills, the rarer battle pets will eventually appear.\n\nSo if you're waiting around for hours, it could be because no catches or kills are happening in your zone--especially if it's a low population area.\n\nThe first time I tried looking for the Scorpling, I was flying circles for an hour around the mesa and found nothing. \n\nThe second time, I checked the mesa, didn't see anything, then flew a lazy circle around Blasted Lands killing any pets that I could find. I did this for about 20 mins, then flew back and two had appeared. The were both poor, but at least I had caught one for achievements, and without waiting hours upon hours.\n\nThis trick has worked for other rares also, like the Jade Oozling and the Tiny Twister--both of which only have 5-6 spawn points in a zone. I generally hunt for pets around 2-4am, so I have little to no competition and don't have to worry about campers sweeping in as I clear pets.","date":"2012-11-18T07:59:26-06:00","rating":156,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Go to the Tainted Forest to kill critters while trying to get the scorpling to spawn.

About 5 minutes later a single one spawned SE of the dark portal.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>795337</b></h3>looked for these critters in the hills behind the dark portal and there were none to be found, so I went searching for other things to kil and capture. came back about an hour later and there were 4 of them, no rares but 2 uncommon. So they do spawn in the hills there, just need to be patient.<br /><br />update: right after posting this, I went back to the game and there were 5 or 6 more the respawned, including my rare!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>decembre</b></h3>These, along with many of the other rarer battle pet spawns, seem to work much like fishing nodes--where only a set amount of battle pets can be on the map at one time. When wild pets are caught or killed in the zone, it frees up a spot for a new spawn to appear somewhere on the map. Because there are more 'normal' pet nodes in a zone, it is more likely that a 'normal' battle pet will spawn, with a smaller chance to spawn at the 'rarer' spawns. But it seems with enough catches/kills, the rarer battle pets will eventually appear.<br /><br />So if you're waiting around for hours, it could be because no catches or kills are happening in your zone--especially if it's a low population area.<br /><br />The first time I tried looking for the Scorpling, I was flying circles for an hour around the mesa and found nothing. <br /><br />The second time, I checked the mesa, didn't see anything, then flew a lazy circle around Blasted Lands killing any pets that I could find. I did this for about 20 mins, then flew back and two had appeared. The were both poor, but at least I had caught one for achievements, and without waiting hours upon hours.<br /><br />This trick has worked for other rares also, like the Jade Oozling and the Tiny Twister--both of which only have 5-6 spawn points in a zone. I generally hunt for pets around 2-4am, so I have little to no competition and don't have to worry about campers sweeping in as I clear pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>utoch</b></h3>I would add, try at night. Did not see any during daylight hours at all. However saw two upon log in while in zone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>865514</b></h3>Was hovering over the mesa while I tabbed over here to check tricks to try and get it to spawn, tab back to the game to move, and one had spawned under me, and to my surprise it was a rare one! Woo!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MyPetsAreEpic</b></h3>I killed the <a href="/npc=5983/bonepicker-felfeeder">Bonepicker Felfeeder</a>s flying above the mountain and got a spawn shortly after.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>776458</b></h3>I only killed/battled about three critters around the mesa, then I started to kill the birds flying above it. I did two or three rounds of this. Then a scorpling spawned. There was about three other people flying around, but the Dark Portal was a whole mess of PVP at the time so I don't know if they were pet collecting and killing/battling critters or not. Anyway, it worked for me. At about 10:30 pm. It's an uncommon. Which was better than I was expecting and I definitely would have settled for less so I feel very lucky, for a change.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jayrai</b></h3>I've been battling random critters in the area, in hopes of finding a Scorpling as a secondary.<br /><br />I think it's safe to say that they do not. <br /><br />I've been at it for a few hours and no luck. Though, I could just be having bad luck. If you have seen one as a secondary, please post! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1076296</b></h3>I just found around 10 spawned in this area at 10am realm time.<br />Fought 7, 5 were poor, 2 were white.<br /><br />I had tried before at other times with no luck at all, and after I came back from a random dungeon (at around 10:45) there were none to be seen.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PlatinumR</b></h3>A tip for those of you that are hunting for this guy in the Pre-WoD patch (6.0):<br /><br />If you're having trouble finding this guy fly over to Zidormi at the northern entrance of the zone and ask her to go to the past. I found lots of these little guys roaming around in a seemingly barren zone</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1124070</b></h3>Patch 6.0.2 alert - these pets only show up in the legacy version of the Blasted Lands.<br /><br />This means that now (post patch 6.0.2), you will need to visit Zidormi the Bronze Dragon (human female model) in Blasted Lands near the entrance to Swamp of Sorrows (North of the map, the road that leads out) in order to see and pet battle the Scorplings. Talk to her and ask her to show you a vision of the older Blasted Lands, and she will give you a buff that shows you the phased, older version of the zone.<br /><br />That's all. Hope it helps anyone who hasn't caught one or is searching for an elusive rare!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mandams</b></h3>Seems like with WoD the spawns were greatly increased.<br />At 8 am I flew over from Stormwind to Blasted Lands and went to the dark portal. On the plateau south of it I found my first Scorpling and snagged it.</div>

I was stupid enough to just look at the top most comment. Wasted so much time :( I did what the other posters mentioned, I spoke to <b>Zidormi</b> who is located at 48,07. She's easily missed but shes standing on the left side of the road. When I was in the past I flew down to 61,57 and found a few of them there 3 to be precise.<br /><br />Hope this information helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Darnusk</b></h3>If you cannot find the scorpling, talk to Zidormi (located 48.15, 7.3) and change the map to pre-invasion. The go back to the area where the scoplings spawn and you will see them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Parkernorman26</b></h3>If you're ever having trouble finding these, try going to <a href="/npc=88206/zidormi">Zidormi</a> at the entrance to the Blasted Lands.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kharlkuhlinayn</b></h3>While doing the Kazzak I noticed these were the 1 pet I didn't have from the zone. Went to where they spawn and there were plenty. The key is that the respawn rate is VERY slow....like 30-60 minutes it seems. <br /><br />So if you aren't seeing them it is very possible that it is because they have all been fought and haven't respawned yet as well, not just a timeline issue.</div>
