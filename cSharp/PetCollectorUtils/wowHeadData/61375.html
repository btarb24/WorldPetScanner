Be aware that only one of these pets will survive, but because of that it will at least get a bit of XP. The biggest reason you can do this and get this awesome high level creature is due to the fact that it doe snot have a second pet come in to fight the battle, even though every other zone past around level 10 does. \r\n\r\nStart out with your critter. This is because it is going to be doing more damage against the shade, by critter bonus. Using a critter that can heal is beneficial, just to keeping itself alive for a few rounds. Next, I would rotate out to either the toad or the netherray, just to buy myself some time. Generally by this time, I can throw a trap, but the trap takes a few tries. \r\n\r\nLastly, I used my beast, simply because it had the most HP\/level. \r\n\r\nTrapped 2 uncommons and 1 rare out of three, which leads me to believe perhaps these little guys are at least always uncommon, due to rarity, and (on the beta) high demand.

I can also say their abilities changed a bit from the beta, as they no longer have the epic (and epically annoying) haunt -- which would end the pet battle.","date":"2012-09-27T02:53:09-05:00","rating":-7,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Sadly, I wish you were right but I have to break the sad news.

Caught a common, then started looking for an uncommon or rare. Went through all but one, which turned out to be a rare, making me happy...\n\nThe shadeling fired off one attack, then I get this \"Internal Pet Battle Error\" and the battle abruptly ends. I really wanted that rare, but attempting to battle it just kept giving \"Pet Battle already in progress\" or \"Failed to create pet battle\" error messages, even after a reload. So frustrating... \n\nThe entrance to the place I found these in was the [u]foundation of a destroyed house, down some cellar stairs[\/u] (visible from the sky or ground), that is what you look for. Arcane Eyes were on the surface. The pet's 3D model is the same as that of the ghost that \"haunts\" you if you carry a Haunted Memento, but where the Memento ghost stands taller than a Tauren, these are tiny, 1\/8th the height if that (hoof-high on a Tauren). [Note: Apparently the HM Ghost scales in size with character height, these sizes are with a Tauren.] Also significant differences in transparency and the dark mist cloud that surrounds it. This also follows you the same way any non-flying battle pet does, where the Haunted Memento follows you slowly, and makes you do the \/cower emote when it is in range and you are facing it. Haunted Memento also gives the Haunted \"buff\" that these don't, keeps a greater distance from you, and is untargetable. The two have more differences than similarities IMO... still, I'd think this pet would elicit more comments than the Memento, as I for one have never seen anybody with this out as their companion (and I look), and it is a cool little pet.\n\n[u]They ALWAYS battle alone[\/u] (where most at this level have two buddies that join the fight), I only saw one comment saying this and thought it was worth a mention. This makes it easy to go in with three pets that are lower level than the shade (for the bonus exp), yet still be able to catch any rare\/uncommon that may pop up. And, like any times you see posted in wow, if you are in the USA you go by Pacific time.\n\nIf you want a Memento, keep in mind that while they are expensive, their increasing rarity makes the item possibly the single best investment you could make in the game. I wouldn't think the existence of this pet has had or will have any impact on the market for them. Some people advise buying one whenever the price drops under 20K, though on my less-populated server I'd say anywhere under 15K you could pick one up and double your money. These are one of the items I have my AH addon look for and I would personally buy one any time the price was 12K or less, despite already owning two. It definitely takes some time to find a buyer for these at full price, but when players get desperate for fast gold or don't realize the item's value and list them cheap, jump on it.","date":"2013-10-25T08:54:37-05:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2014-01-16T15:05:31-06:00",2,"BMHunterMain"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":110,"id":1913333,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Atrisha","body":"Just nabbed mine this morning on Kel'Thuzad US.

Seems to be just a random early morning spawn after midnight. Restless is absolutely right.\r\n\r\nMy tip - Don't cross the barrier. Only about 3 spawn back there, and the area outside has more. The only way to cross back over is to die and rez on the other side, but the catch is that the mobs behind the barrier can't be kited so it's hard to make sure you're dying close enough and by the time you're done, who knows if there will be any left. There is a high level quest that seemed to be bringing a lot of traffic, so extra competition can be expected.\r\n\r\nFor those saying that they didn't see a barrier, there are 2 stairwells that lead into the cellars, both have a mage at the top. The western one has the barrier, the eastern one does not. In my experience, there was actually less traffic and more spawns in the eastern one, so I recommend going there.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Spiritess</b></h3>So, after spending a few hours today looking for even one pet battle in Deadwind Pass, I have found... nothing. I've looked everywhere, I want one of these! I've tried killing things, not killing things, tried talking to Lydia Accoste, she doesn't say much... Any help please?<br /><br />Edit; I found, going back EARLY the next day, like an hour after server reset, I was able to catch some, and then I waited around for a bit for some respawns, never came. It seems some pets once farmed, will not respawn until after a server reset/restart. <br /><br />Flayer Youngling is another pet I've been waiting around for and looking for, haven't found one yet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>These are not found above ground at all. You need to go into The Master's Cellar (either of them) to locate them. These cellars, for those who might not have done the quests, are in the buildings to the southeast of where Archmage Alturus is.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1030749</b></h3>You can find this guy near Kara, downstairs in the catacombs/cellar. He pops up at midnight server time. Not sure how long they stay up but that is when they make their first appearance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zeterai</b></h3>I'm not sure if this made it into Live - it doesn't show up in the pet journal at all. I'll check back tomorrow morning, but I haven't got very high hopes.<br /><br /><i>Apparently my Journal was broken. It <b>is</b> showing up now, and is correctly tagged as as Morning-only spawn in Deadwind Pass.</i><br /><br />Furthermore: Just caught one at around 2 AM Server time. The 0700-0730 bit isn't true. Master's Cellar was full of the little guys and I managed to pick up a Rare one. It had attack and speed values in the 180's. The greens had 150-160ish. Level 17.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Invaki</b></h3>These undead critters spawn only at night down in the cellars near Karazhan. They pop up at 12am (midnight) sharp, so if you want first dibs be there on the dot. Once they are battled they respawn very slowly, which makes finding a rare very annoying. It took me 2 days, but I found one.<br /><br />Rare:<br />After Catch: Level 16, 1192 hp, 166 power, 156 speed<br />Before Catch: Level 17, ~1200 hp<br /><br />As you can see, once these pets are caught they lose a level.<br />In battling, I find they are very strong with their healing capabilities, but can't withstand large attacks.<br /><br />Good luck catching your own <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=40110/haunted-memento">Haunted Momento</a>, minus the space it takes in your bags.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>anisadora</b></h3>I got one of these, when my highest pet before hand was only a level 13. &quot;HAX, HAAAAXX&quot; you cry.. but no! and fear not, for I shall share with you the secret to getting this awesome pet. <br /><br />I used a beast (level 13, rare, Snow Cub), a critter (level 10 gazelle fawn, also rare) and alternated between a flying (level 12, Netherray) and a toad (uncommon, around level 12.) Be aware that only one of these pets will survive, but because of that it will at least get a bit of XP. The biggest reason you can do this and get this awesome high level creature is due to the fact that it doe snot have a second pet come in to fight the battle, even though every other zone past around level 10 does. <br /><br />Start out with your critter. This is because it is going to be doing more damage against the shade, by critter bonus. Using a critter that can heal is beneficial, just to keeping itself alive for a few rounds. Next, I would rotate out to either the toad or the netherray, just to buy myself some time. Generally by this time, I can throw a trap, but the trap takes a few tries. <br /><br />Lastly, I used my beast, simply because it had the most HP/level. <br /><br />Trapped 2 uncommons and 1 rare out of three, which leads me to believe perhaps these little guys are at least always uncommon, due to rarity, and (on the beta) high demand. These may have changed a bit, as on the beta, they would also despawn after 5 minutes. I can also say their abilities changed a bit from the beta, as they no longer have the epic (and epically annoying) haunt -- which would end the pet battle.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nagoragama</b></h3>Getting a rare of one of these guys is extremely frustrating. I managed to get one to spawn, but my trap missed 6 times in a row, and it ended up killing my entire party.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kokiron</b></h3>Found a level 17 rare one right off the bat, but my team being lvl 12s made it a bit rough. Got lucky and my trap caught it a turn before he killed my last pet. If you intend to go after these guys, I suggest having a team higher level than mine was...lol. They do, however, seem to only fight you one at a time instead of double or triple battles like most other pets do.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>computerweekend</b></h3>They spawn exactly at midnight, server time, in the Master's Cellar by Karazhan. They are NOT in the raid. The entrance to the cellar is close to the meeting stone - just look around the destroyed houses, you'll see the staircase down on the floor.<br /><br />There seems to be more rares than your average battle pet. I was farming them with my husband - he found a poor, common, then rare. I found poor, poor, and then rare. They seem to all have health as their special stat, as every shade we found did. It looked as though there was one spawn exactly at midnight, and then another small spawn just a few minutes later. I stuck around for about 30 minutes and did not see another spawn, so if you're looking to get one of these guys, get there before midnight SERVER time and farm quickly! Consider being nice and leaving the rest after you get your rare, unless you want a full team of them. This is a difficult pet to get, so be considerate! :)<br /><br />I also noticed that Deadwind Pass was a cross-realm zone, at least for Steamwheedle Cartel (US), at least for the day we waited for the spawn. Normally, Steamwheedle Cartel (US) is an EST server, but the server time in Deadwind Pass was reading as PST. Please take note of this, and note of what time zone your Deadwind Pass is, as it may be different than the time zone of your server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mcdisney2001</b></h3>They spawned at exactly midnight server time. The level 17s with 1171 hp were Uncommon; I did not find anything higher than that. I skipped the ones that had 899 hp after confirming they were poor quality.<br /><br />The one I tamed was originally a level 17 with 1171 hp. After taming it became a level 16 with 1108 hp, 154 power and 144 speed. All of the others with the same amount of hp that I tamed had the exact same stats, but it still might be possible for the power and speed to vary.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>369766</b></h3>Took me 9 captures to get my rare, and I kept an uncommon, a common and then compared to the rare, the rare not only has more health, but has much higher damage and speed. Happy haunting :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>805630</b></h3>I don't know what's up, but Deadwind Pass is two hours off from the rest of my zone. I wonder if it's because of cross zone play. In any case, I headed over just before realm midnight and waited for the hour. No shadelings in either cellar. I spent a good half hour wandering the cellars. Then I noticed the time was 2 a.m. not 12. Left the zone and time went back to normal - 12:30 or so by this time. Crossed back... 2 hours later again. Bummed cuz I logged on just for that. Anybody seen this here or on other zones? Matters when you have something time-sensitive like this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>126915</b></h3>I was nearly very sad while searching for a rare version of this pet. I went through quite a few spawns and captured some uncommon versions on the way. Finally I found a rare, but my trap button stayed greyed out. I'd forgotten about the &quot;max 3 of each battle pet&quot; rule, and it wouldn't let me catch the rare! It also wouldn't let me release any pets while in a battle.<br /><br />I figured I had nothing to lose, so I alt-f4'd out of the battle. When I came back in the rare was still sitting there alive! I released a pet, started the battle again, and captured him :)<br /><br />Moral of the story: if you're farming a rare pet, make sure you don't already have 3 copies of it.<br /><br />Edit: as Gershuun says below, the alt f4 thing was hotfixed. It will be back in 5.2 however, according to current patch notes (&quot;Disconnecting from a pet battle will once again respawn the pets you were fighting&quot;). You'll also be able to flee without despawning though, at the price of some damage to your pets (&quot;Fleeing a pet battle will no longer despawn the pet that was being battled, but doing so will now inflict some damage on the fleeing pet battle team&quot;).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1042403</b></h3>Well I and several others were there at exactly midnight several nights in a row and no spawns, but i got woke up at about 6am server so logged in to look and there were a lot of them on both sides of the master's cellar so my guess is the Early Morning spawn is more accurate look after midnight until sunrise</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1044793</b></h3>Just because I camped this for 7 hrs, I HAD to make an account just to explain......OK, here goes.<br /><br />First of all: I am ahead of my server by 2 hours, but when I zone in to Kara, it's on my time. So when I'm in Org (or SW) let's say REALM time 12:00 p.m., that means it is 2:00 p.m. my time.<br /><br />I arrived at Kara around 11:50 p.m. my time (which my server would have been 9:50 p.m. any other place except Kara). No spawns for 7 hours.... I searched both of the Master's cellars the whole time to pass the time. Finally, at 7:15 a.m. (My time, which would be 5:15 a.m. my &quot;regular&quot; server time). I saw one spawn so I hurried to it and claimed it. And yes, they are right when they say he's painful to battle. Not just because he can heal himself but because you're trying extremely hard not to kill him. Needless to say, I claimed him and named him Painful.<br /><br /><b><u>I recommend using pets WITHOUT DOTS.</u></b><br /><br />He DOES fight alone. After I claimed him I went and camped the Minfernal. Took a flight path there and spent about 15 minutes there and he spawned. <br /><br />I DID have trouble w/ cross realm zoning when I got to the Minfernal. I took a flight path to Felwood from Orgrimmar and I could see them when I flew past the spawn point, but when I landed, nothing. I kept flying around doing /silly at some alliance and chatting w/ the other horde that were there and I finally found one. Again, <b><u>I recommend NOT USING DOTS ON THIS GUY.</u></b> This lil guy DOES fight w/ one other pet, so I recommend using a pet that can take a beating but not put out too much damage or rely on dots for damage.

I also suggest finding an addon that tells you the quality of the pet at the beginning of the battle (I got mine from <a href="https://www.wowinterface.com" rel="nofollow">www.wowinterface.com</a> and found one called street fighter) so avoid pointless time taken for looking at stats and figting poor quality pets because there was loads of them for about 5 minutes then they despawned right in front of my eyes. Be quick and good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>450639</b></h3>A note to everyone farming Rare battle pets: run the following script as a macro ONCE, for each time you log into WoW. Do not be alarmed when no confirmatory message appears, it will at the start of battle.<br /><br />/run hooksecurefunc(&quot;PlaySoundKitID&quot;, function(Q) if Q==31584 then for i=1,C_PetBattles.GetNumPets(2) do SELECTED_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(C_PetBattles.GetName(2,i)..&quot; - &quot;.._G) end end end)<br /><br />This causes a message to display in your chat log at the start of battle that announces the rarity of every enemy participant.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>149563</b></h3>My advice is to know your individual cross-realm schedule for Deadwind Pass ahead of time, or you are apt to be disappointed the first time you show up. The battle pets <i>do</i> continue to spawn, as has been stated -- but similar to how the most <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62258">Silithid Hatchlings</a> in Tanaris seem to appear right at the start of the sandstorm and as time goes by begin to spawn at a much, much slower rate, the same seems to be the case for the Restless Shade at midnight.<br /><br />So in other words, as Doc Emmett Brown so often said, &quot;Run for it, Marty!&quot;<br /><br />Hmm, I can't help but wonder if all the monkeying-around with server time is <i>actually</i> a result of The Bronze Flight's vastly-diminished powers to control the timeways...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>fademyken</b></h3>Confirmed, computerweekend's post they DO spawn at 12am server time in &quot;The Master's Cellar&quot; (1 destroyed house basement entrance and another destroyed house basement entrance in the house directly in front of it) and will keep spawning for 1 hour. I alone took every single one of these out that morning, forfeiting many battles where the hp amount was repeated and I had tested its quality prior. The magical HP amount you are looking for on these is 1050 for a rare. They all were level 17 and de-level when you acquired them to 16. I found 2 rares in 1 hour both had 1050 HP. after I decimated the population by 1am no new shadelings spawned. I can only assume that if anyone has found them after 1am it is because no one farmed them in the hours prior to your arrival. Hope this helps.</div>

After that number has been captured or killed it wont spawn any more until next midnight.<br /><br />So are you arriving, lets say 00.30 or later they are most likely gone becuse a bunch of other player's was there at 00.00 and snatched them all.<br /><br />It fight solo and have 2 abilities that gives it health so bring some pet's that can survive a number of trap throws.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LizzieTheShizzie</b></h3>I went previously to check on the time of my Deadwind Pass, and it was 3 hours behind that of my actual time - so I arrived in the cellar at about 2:30 (Just to be on the safe side) and the little guys started spawning at exactly 3:00am. I noticed that they only respawned maybe once or twice - but several spawned at once, maybe 10 or 11 in total. After sitting there for 10 minutes to make sure no more were spawning I moved over into the other cellar to find there were even more sitting in there, maybe another 15 or so.<br />So after spamming my macro <br />/run for i=1,C_PetBattles.GetNumPets(2) do SELECTED_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(C_PetBattles.GetName(2,i)..&quot; - &quot;.._G) end<br />at the begining of each pet battle, I was able to determine it's quality WITHOUT looking at it's stats, and was able to find my rare after 11 or so battles.<br />Happy hunting! He is a cutie. Well worth the lack of sleep hehe.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>963188</b></h3>Please note that of significant importance when trying to capture this pet, unlike other undead pets this one DOES NOT return to life on a fatal attack. Also as previously posted the spawn rate starts at midnight server time, including cross realm differences. If your server is at midnight and the realm for Eastern Kingdoms is set for 9 you're waiting 3 hours for the spawn to start.<br /><br />I just lost a rare quality because my attack critically hit the poor thing. And since there's only a finite spawn I couldn't get another one. Guess i have to wait til next time I'm up at 3AM (thanks blizz for the cross-realm server difference).</div>

They Lasted around 18min before I did't see any others spawn. Most were deeper into ether cellar but some close to the entrances. Not sure if it was the realm mix up but There was quite a few of them. Most were poor but i managed to get two white commons.<br /><br />Hope this helps all.<br /><br />Edit: I was able to get a rare thanks to a budd! He was able to hold the pet until I arrived.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>125795</b></h3><b>My hunt for a rare</b><br /><br />Facts that are true on my realm/battlegroup<br /><ul><li>at 00:01 servertime there is a massspawn</li><li>each time I am there alone at massspawn, I see 32 total, that includes respawns and I see nothing after the 12 minutes it takes to check them all</li></ul><br />Also, a word of experience is in order. Get the rare with highest speed, it is much better than the pet with highest power. Above level 20 you will want to use &quot;Phase Shift&quot;, and if you are the one with highest speed, you will dodge that attack AND the next.<br /><br />I use it regulary as my starter pet, but I have an uncommon one with power as highest stat. If I have the highest speed, I use &quot;Phase Shift&quot; first, dodge their attack, use &quot;Plagued Blood&quot; and dodge their attack again, then I swap pets with a nice heal buff and my Shady still at full HP. However, if I do not have the fastest pet in the start, I only use &quot;Plagued Blood&quot; and swap asap, but I do take some damage from one attack.<br /><br />So ye, get a rare with speed as highest of the two.<br /><br />Try1:<br />Out of 32 battles, I saw 14 uncommon, 13 grey, 5 common and 0 rares<br /><br />Try2:<br />I tried again tonight at 00:01, this time I finished at 00:12 with 32 spawns checked. I saw 18 uncommon, 12 grey, 2 common, 0 rares.<br />Is it a coincidence I have found 32 spawns each massspawn at midnight or is 32 the set amount, I wonder.. <br /><br />Try3:<br />I tried again at 06:01, I did not see a mass spawn, but I did find 7 spawns at first, and then 5 more around 06:25 and 7 scattered around 06:25-07:05. A total of 5 uncommon, 10 grey, 3 common and 1 rare (with hp/power as highest stat, not was I was looking for, doh!)<br /><br />Try4:<br />Went away 30 mins, came back at 07:35 and found 6 spawns; 2 uncommon and 4 common.<br /><br />Try5:<br />00:01-00:17 servertime<br />Caught 10 rares the first 17 spawns I checked, it took me 14 minutes since I had to battle and box em to check how the stats turned out, it was a weird night.. <br />Stats for the evening: 28 spawns checked, 10 rares, 7 common, 6 grey, 5 uncommon<br /><br />This makes the total stat I am up to at 117 battles; 44 uncommon(37.6%), 41 grey(35%), 21 common(18%) and 11 rare(9.4%). Fun fact: uncommons are more common than commons.. ;-) Another useful fact perhaps: 10 out of 11 rares had speed as best stat, the one exception had higher health instead.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cyleste</b></h3>Got on at 7:30 server time and didn't see any on the side I left my toon. So I went to the Western side and there were tons. In my attempt at a rare, I went through all 8 on that side. (2 uncommon, 1 poor and the rest were common). But as I captured the last one, I turned around and one had spawned right behind me. Since I still didn't have a rare, I thought I would try the Eastern side again. When I went back over there, at least 20 had spawned. That said, I am not sure if there is a set time they stop spawning. And don't give up, try the other side again! Got the rare after 15 tries, with tons of Shadelings left for everyone else!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bruttenholm</b></h3>From what I've experienced, many of the commenters here are providing good information about the tamable undead critter.<br /><br />Where I'm skeptical is the timing -- most of you are saying it spawns shortly after midnight, local or zone/xrealm server time.<br /><br />I tried going after this pet 3 times at midnight, xrealm server time (which happens to be the same time as my zone world server time). I stayed for about an hour each time, the third time staying well past an hour (to about 1:30 am xrealm server time). <b>No spawns</b>.<br /><br />Logging back in to the cellars at 8 am local server time, I found a dozen of these guys just waiting to be tamed.<br /><br />In my server group, I suspect critters do not spawn at midnight server, but rather midnight PST. I'd have to stay up 'til 2 am to know this for sure. If and when I do that, I'll update this entry.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1043922</b></h3>I got there at around 7:30 am realm time and there were 22 spawns up and no other players there, so I went and checked them all out. There was 1 rare, 4 uncommons, the rest common and poor quality. They continued to spawn while I was running around, so give the early morning a try. Make sure you check both cellars!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>795337</b></h3>They don't spawn only at midnight, I found plenty of these in the Master's Cellar (the side that looks like a crypt, not the cave side) at around 6:30am server time. They spawn by themselves as well, meaning, no back-up ;)<br />I had been through there about 2 hours prior and there were none in either cellar.<br />Also, there was no problem finding a rare, though that could just be my luck.<br /><br />Glad I didn't have to wait until midnight!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>920932</b></h3>The best way to hunt this one is to have a high level druid sat in the cellar and make sure to log on a minute or so before midnight, then you can run around in catform to be a little quicker than the other people if there's competition for the pet and if you need to you can always use dash for some extra speed and flight form if you need to travel the short distance between the different cellars. Of course anything with a speed increase is helpful but I used my druid to get this one. Took my 3 nights to get a rare one even though I know I can upgrade it when patch 5.1 comes, I really wanted to get this one as a &quot;real&quot; rare.<br /><br />Good luck hunting!</div>

They were everywhere so I quickly captured one (got a green from the first one) and went to park my toon in the cellar to be ready for the restless shadelings upon relog later that night. To my surprise they too were everywhere! I had thought these were only supposed to be there at night after midnight (that was how I got my first one-a gray quality). I quickly started battling them and was able to upgrade to a green quality. Not sure if it was a weird glitch, but something I thought should be noted.</div>

There was about 20 or so, I sliced through all of them trying to find a rare, but they respawned so fast by the time i was leaving the basement I could go back and grab more. I went through about 30 before I got my first rare, just before 5 am. By the time I left 90-100% of my kills had respawned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>986651</b></h3>So last night, I made sure I had a toon parked in the cellar. For me,the spawn time is 2am since I am on CST. Right on time, there were tons up! I was so excited and seemed to be alone. First one i got was common, figured I'd capture him just in case. It's a good thing I did as 2 jerks, one ally one horde, showed up and decimated all the spawns. They weren't trying to capture, they were just ruining it for everyone else. <br /><br />So I decided to go back again tonight and try for a rare. I get on a few mins before 2am. There are a few other Alliance on, we chat for a bit and then get to work. All of a sudden, those same jerks from the night before are back. I'm like seriously? Nothing better to do at 2am than greif other players? <br /><br />Well anyway, I warn the other alliance about them and I get a move on. First pet was poor, I quickly exit fight. Next was common, exit again. 3rd was a rare! Happy that this was the rare, since by the time I got out of the fight, all the spawns were gone thanks to the jerks. One of the others got an uncommon and sadly, one didn't even get a chance before the massacre (the cellar can be quite confusing to travel in) These also despawn at 9am if your lucky enough to have them survive that long. I reccommend getting there a bit early and getting towards the middle, just in case some jerks decide to show up on your server.</div>

One trip through the cellar got me 10 or more of these guys .. mostly grey, one rare which was actually a respawn that I got on my way out.<br /><br />Edit: Went away for a while to capture other stuff, came back to look for the eye pets and noticed two more shadelings on my minimap.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>m4zurka</b></h3>finally had some luck finding this guy around 3am! having seen that his spawning condition is &quot;early morning,&quot; i had tried before at 1am and 6am on different days but hadn't seen a single one.<br /><br />this time i entered the first cellar and as i made my way through the tunnels they were everywhere. there were a dozen in the first cellar, half of those i saw on my way in and half were new spawns on my way out. there were a dozen in the second cellar on my first pass, but i couldn't enter into battle with one right in the first hallway because the area was &quot;obstructed.&quot; i went back into the first cellar again and a few more had spawned. i finally got my rare on the 26th battle. again a few more had spawned on my way out, but i left those alone.<br /><br />some things to note: <br />1.) there are two entrances to the Master's Cellar on the ground amongst the broken-down buildings at Karazhan. the two do not connect underground, so check both. <br />2.) the only ones you can see from above ground are any that happen to be right in the first hallway on your way in.<br />2.) the Restless Shadeling fights alone.<br /><br />happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Celtictess</b></h3>I got a rare Shadeling at 11:25 am US Stormrage, so the theory that this pet can only be obtained in the wee hours is obviously incorrect. I was traveling to Deadwind Pass to do my daily pet battle with Lydia Accoste and, much to my surprise, I saw the little devils underground in the basements. Got my rare and was really excited. Exited the cellar and there were many Arcane Eyes all around....bonus!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1012488</b></h3>The Restless Shadeling is not one of the hard-to-find pets, getting one is simply a matter of being in the area at the correct time and they will be plentiful when spawning. As such: don't concern yourself with being naughty and &quot;farming a rare&quot;. If another player shows up late they will have despawned already and besides - the poor sap can always try again the next morning.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>aslaja</b></h3>I can confirm that on EU servers (Drak'thul) they spawn at midnight server time. There was an initial spawn of about five of them in the cellar and after we cleaned them, some more respawned.<br /><br />I was afraid there might be some time zone business similar to the US servers' Pacific time issue. I am in the Paris time zone and it seems safe to rely on the server time.<br /><br />BTW rarity of these pets certainly is a matter of RNG, as half of mine were green and the other half grey.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Saihun</b></h3>Found these little guys at 9:50 AM on a CST server this morning in the cellar right outside of Karazhan. I stayed up last night until midnight server time and waited for about half an hour but never saw any spawns. Checked back this morning and found them. It was already past their spawning time according to my server clock, so I wasn't holding out much hope for grabbing one today. It does seem that they are in fact on pacific time rather than your server time. I had decent luck with the quality of pets, also. Out of the four I had to battle, I found two green quality, one white, and a blue. Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>elvisdumbledore</b></h3>I haven't seen much info. on how late &quot;early morning&quot; is and since all star/end times are now tied to Pacific Time it seemed worth reporting my experience here.<br /><br />I started farming them at 8:42am EDT (5:42 PDT). I made a full clear of 1/2 of the Master's Cellar. I didn't see any other pet farmers but I took it slow anyway, battling them all instead of just killing them. After that I moved on to the other 1/2 and cleared it. When I returned to the first half (9:15am EDT/6:15 PDT) they were just starting to respawn and I watched several spawn over the next few minutes.<br /><br />That means &quot;early morning&quot; ends sometime after 6am PDT/9am EDT (probably at least 7am/10am). Plenty of time for us east coasters to get them before work or class as the case may be. :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dalent</b></h3>The Restless Shadeling never has other pets enter the battle with it. The same goes for <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=68819/arcane-eye">Arcane Eye</a>. Not sure what other pets share this behavior.<br /><br />It does make leveling pets up faster with the two, as you can lead with a low level pet, swap to a level 25 and easily take it down and not have to worry about a whole team.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ddanish</b></h3>Logged in at 8:30 am server time, battled every single one that I could find (a dozen or two), except for the one that gave the message about the pet battle area being obstructed. That one was still hanging around after 9:00 am but there were no new spawns thereafter. Logged back in at 3:15 pm server time and the poor lonely fellow was gone. So either someone else came along and battled him, or they despawn at a certain time. Will repeat this experiment tomorrow and post the results as I failed to get a blue today.</div>

Don't forget that there are 2 entrances to the cellar, and both portions will spawn them. It took me 10 or 11 tries before I found a rare quality one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Burnay</b></h3>A rare one is not guaranteed. I was there all by my lonesome when these spawned at exactly 1 AM Mountain time and I looked at everyone of the spawns in both cellar areas and not a single rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>444304</b></h3>Got mine this morning. First one was a lvl 16 rare that I was able to capture. There are a ton down in the Master's Cellar and if you're above 70, the mobs are nothing. Make sure you don't go to the Crypt behind Kara, next to the trainer. If you're like me, you can't get in and it'll just piss you off that you may be running out of time. Good luck getting yours!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Akitnaya</b></h3>I was looking at all my magic &amp; undead pet stats &amp; stumbled upon this pet in my journal. I was SO happy I did because I was totally about to spent 12K on a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=40110">Haunted Memento</a>. (I started playing WoW when Mists came out so have no way to acquire 1 now.) At around 2am, I went to Deadwind Pass &amp; flew around. Saw nothing. Finally found the entrance to the Master's Cellar &amp; ran around killing all the ghosts &amp; again, saw nothing. At exactly 3am, a bunch of Restless Shadelings spawned. Took about 3-4 pet battles to find a rare quality one. Battled poor, common, uncommon &amp; rare so it's possible to find any of those quality pets, all depending on RNG. I stayed around for an hr after that &amp; around 3:32am, the Shadelings all disappeared.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>alkemist</b></h3>Was a little confused, as I thought they only spawned at night/early morning.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wazdakka</b></h3>I woke up the morning near Karazhan, so I decided to kill a few while waiting for the Headless Horseman in dungeon que. Happily, I nailed a rare on my second kill. However, the point of this post is <i>not</i> for me to brag about obtaining a rare object, but rather to inform you of an observation that I noticed as I proceeded to kill EVERY SINGLE (with the exception of one) Shadeling in the Crypt for experience, to level up some lowbie pets. Many of the Shadelings (at least 4-5), primarily those that were level 18, simply spammed Death and Decay for the entirety of the fight. This made it ridiculously easy to kill them, to the point that I actually killed a couple with only my level 12 Sinister Squashling. <br /><br />So: Protip: easy leveling here with a chance of rares.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>716334</b></h3>While there is plenty of comment about spawn times I haven't seen much discussion about this pet's usefulness or which breed people using it prefer. I've got a rare of the &quot;tanky&quot; H/H breed 6 but i've not used it much except to level it a bit - what do people think of this pet and what breed to try for ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BMHunterMain</b></h3>I got a message that my server was being restarted in 15 minutes, an hour earlier than scheduled to &quot;address gameplay issues&quot; just after I found one of the cellars with the shadelings. Caught a common, then started looking for an uncommon or rare. Went through all but one, which turned out to be a rare, making me happy...<br /><br />The shadeling fired off one attack, then I get this &quot;Internal Pet Battle Error&quot; and the battle abruptly ends. I really wanted that rare, but attempting to battle it just kept giving &quot;Pet Battle already in progress&quot; or &quot;Failed to create pet battle&quot; error messages, even after a reload. So frustrating... <br /><br />The entrance to the place I found these in was the <u>foundation of a destroyed house, down some cellar stairs</u> (visible from the sky or ground), that is what you look for. Arcane Eyes were on the surface. The pet's 3D model is the same as that of the ghost that &quot;haunts&quot; you if you carry a Haunted Memento, but where the Memento ghost stands taller than a Tauren, these are tiny, 1/8th the height if that (hoof-high on a Tauren). Also significant differences in transparency and the dark mist cloud that surrounds it. This also follows you the same way any non-flying battle pet does, where the Haunted Memento follows you slowly, and makes you do the /cower emote when it is in range and you are facing it. Haunted Memento also gives the Haunted &quot;buff&quot; that these don't, keeps a greater distance from you, and is untargetable. The two have more differences than similarities IMO... still, I'd think this pet would elicit more comments than the Memento, as I for one have never seen anybody with this out as their companion (and I look), and it is a cool little pet.<br /><br /><u>They ALWAYS battle alone</u> (where most at this level have two buddies that join the fight), I only saw one comment saying this and thought it was worth a mention. This makes it easy to go in with three pets that are lower level than the shade (for the bonus exp), yet still be able to catch any rare/uncommon that may pop up. And, like any times you see posted in wow, if you are in the USA you go by Pacific time.<br /><br />If you want a Memento, keep in mind that while they are expensive, their increasing rarity makes the item possibly the single best investment you could make in the game. I wouldn't think the existence of this pet has had or will have any impact on the market for them. Some people advise buying one whenever the price drops under 20K, though on my less-populated server I'd say anywhere under 15K you could pick one up and double your money. These are one of the items I have my AH addon look for and I would personally buy one any time the price was 12K or less, despite already owning two. It definitely takes some time to find a buyer for these at full price, but when players get desperate for fast gold or don't realize the item's value and list them cheap, jump on it.</div>

I woke up at 8:50am and thought I'd give it a shot, and sure enough the cellar was crawling with these guys! I captured the first one I battled which was poor quality in case they despawned and continued to hunt. I was able to get an uncommon on the second battle. 2 more battles, both poor quality and then seconds before the clock hit 9:00am they all despawned. So if you are looking for these guys make sure to check before then!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kinigit</b></h3>These spawn at midnight PACIFIC time, not server time.<br /><br />The Master's Cellars where these spawn are in front of the entrance to Karazhan in Deadwind Pass, Eastern Kingdoms.<br /><br />There are two entrances to the Master's cellars. They are in two burned out houses right across the path from each other.<br /><br />Their coordinates are:<br /><br />47.70 , 78.25 and 48.70, 78.86<br /><br />They lead to two separate and distinct Master's cellars. So, if you do not find your rare in the first one do not give up, there are more to check in the second one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kellhell1</b></h3>Just an update as of 2/16/14, I arrived early and watched the shadeling spawn. It was at 3AM eastern time. No one was there and I found 1 blue shadeling and I ran each cellar twice. The respawn was very fast, maybe 5 minutes and the one blue was at the very end of the second cellar.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Castyle</b></h3>Followed the advice here and popped on at 6:45am Server Time (which was 3:45am PST) - and they were all over the cellars.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pentagram</b></h3>I can confirm by observation that they <b>despawn at 9:00 AM</b>.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Damonra</b></h3>They spawn 3am east coast, U.S. time (2am server time, midnight PST).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Alkiphron</b></h3>Alright, so I got this, round 1 ( I think)<br /><br />I was 20 minutes for the midnight spawns, sadly. They were snapped up and killed off fellow rare hunters, so I decided to log there and wait for the 6 AM ST spawns... except I woke up from my nap 2 hours later. I log in at 3:30 AM ST (still round 1?).<br /><br />I went from <i>Gotta get out of this cellar and do some Timeless farming</i> to <i>Sweet, <b>SWEET</b> 8 pound, 11 ounce baby jesus</i><br /><br />There it was... not it, <b>them</b> I was looking at my mini map to see 7 of them just in my general area. And <b>no</b> competition... at all. So, as per usual, I'm battling all of them looking for rares.I yielded 1 rare, 1 uncommon, and 1 common. I was finished by 4:10 AM ST. I had gone through at least 30 of them, thinking I had gotten them all; I had searched every inch of the cellars. <b>I was wrong</b><br /><br />After laughing at a fellow worgen in front of Karazhan (I don't even know if he was looking for them, but I just had to gloat, I just had to), I look at my mini map to make myself feel even better expecting to see no Shadelings. Except instead of none, another 20 had spawned right under my nose. After even more grinding, I had gotten another uncommon shadeling, and made sure nothing else popped up.<br /><br />For those who didn't have the time to read my EPIC story, and those who are mad at me for killing all the shadelings... too bad. The badge grind sucks, and you know it. Here're some facts to help you next time though:<br /><br />-If you miss the midnight spawn, just wait a solid 3-ish hours between waves<br />-Check BOTH areas of the cellar, don't be discouraged if you see one cleared, many people overlook one or the other<br />-There were about 50-60 spawns total<br /><br />Good Luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>xenowolf</b></h3>I have confirmed (on the Nordrassil server) that these spawn at 12 Midnight Pacific Standard Time (the server is set to Central Standard Time - therefore they spawned at 2 AM CST) {although it used to be Pacific Time before it was merged with Muradin}. Not sure if there is a relation there or not. No Rares spawned, but I did get an Uncommon</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>hollycenations</b></h3>Just nabbed one of these. They spawned pretty much exactly at midnight PST (or 3 AM, server time), first in one cellar, and then in the other. Only found one rare in about 20 or so battles.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jturnero</b></h3>Just nabbed this guy. It was the last pet I needed for World Safari. So I can't speak as to when they spawn but I can tell you that I was there at 11:30am EST and they were all up. This would lead me to believe the other comments here stating that they stay up until 9:00am PST is accurate, as that would be 12 Noon EST. I honestly didn't expect them to be up that late, but hey, worked out in my favor. For all of you east coasters if you work and staying up till 3am sounds more than unsavory, just post an alt there the night before and log on and nab one before you head off to work. Or even better just pick one up on your day off. Happy Hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>squiretoad</b></h3>They spawned at midnight server time (0300 EST), in both cellars.

Then I spent the next 30 minutes very efficiently battling one after another until 00:30 when they stopped respawning.<br />The only ones left were the 2 that I couldn't battle because the &quot;area was obstructed&quot;.<br /><br />During those 30 minutes I only managed to find poors, commons and 3 uncommon ones. No rare ones were to be seen - and I really tried.</div>

Game Master Jybbaric at your disposal. <br /><br />Sorry I couldn't catch you online to chat to you directly! I trust your pet battles are going well, oh master pet trainer! There is currently a known issue where Dalaran being moved over Karazan to defend the Eastern Kingdoms has caused the phazing in Deadwind Pass to go a bit wonky. As such, many of the pet trainers and battlepets in the area have been spooked and run off into hiding! Not to worry, though; once Legion launches events will be in motion that mean these pets will be availaible again :)<br /><br />If you need anything else, just chuck us another ticket and we'll get right on it. We're here to help!<br /><br />Happy questing, and good luck on the path to Legion!</div><br /><br />EDIT: But it is possible to catch it using a second character, that have not completed the pre legion quest.

There are elite mobs all over the place as well. Easy to kill, but time-consuming, at level 100.<br /><br />You can get through the barrier by dying, ghost-running back, and rezzing on the other side.<br /><br />I found that only two of the shadelings were reachable - all but one were on a raised platform that I could not get to (maybe I missed something?) One of the ones on the platform could be fought by jumping &amp; clicking on it at the right moment.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the two was blue. :)</div>

Decided to leave the toon there and check in later. I check in approx 15 minutes past midnight PST, and they are /everywhere/. I caught one, and had loads of time to hunt for a better quality pet. Sure there is a ledge, but several spawned where you could reach them. Was good.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tashstan</b></h3>I have been checking for this each night and found nothing around 12am server time (Shadowmoon which is CTS). I decided to just hang out for a little longer tonight, and at 2:00am server time, they spawned all over inside the cellars. There was no need to &quot;ghost walk&quot; as has been previously mentioned, and in fact, I never even came across the barrier that had been mentioned. Happy hunting and I hope this can help in current content!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wruen</b></h3>I went ahead and ghost walked through the barrier and parked a toon there at midnight. Waited until 12:20 and nothing. Hopped around on other toons and did some things, checking back at 12:30 and every 15 minutes after. Finally, they spawned at 3:00 AM server time. Seems to be just a random early morning spawn after midnight. Restless is absolutely right.<br /><br />My tip - Don't cross the barrier. Only about 3 spawn back there, and the area outside has more. The only way to cross back over is to die and rez on the other side, but the catch is that the mobs behind the barrier can't be kited so it's hard to make sure you're dying close enough and by the time you're done, who knows if there will be any left. There is a high level quest that seemed to be bringing a lot of traffic, so extra competition can be expected.<br /><br />For those saying that they didn't see a barrier, there are 2 stairwells that lead into the cellars, both have a mage at the top. The western one has the barrier, the eastern one does not. In my experience, there was actually less traffic and more spawns in the eastern one, so I recommend going there. Got both of my breeds - one rare, one uncommon - but I'm not about to sit around and wait again, I'll just use a stone on the other.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Timuri</b></h3>If you are leveling a low level alt while going around playing at being a pokemon master, remember to switch to your main (or at least a high level character) before you consider going into either section of the Master's Cellar for these guys. The stat squish at the end of Legion does mean that I wasn't one-shot despite only being level 56 and the mobs down there being level 110, but it's unlikely that you'll get the attention of only one mob doing that. Above ground you can flee on a mount to get away from the high level demons that aggro you, but down in the cellar a lowbie is very screwed if they don't have good movement booster skills.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ur5layer</b></h3>2/20/2022. 9.1.5. Checked several times at different times of the day. Never found any. Read some comments and waited until midnight pacific time and boom, 8-9 of them spawned. I kill them all hoping to find a rare with no luck and there were 4 more up already as I was walking out. I'm on bloodscalp which is central time zone. Hope this helps. (warmode was off for what its worth)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Catra1385</b></h3>The annoying thing about this pet is they spawn at midnight PST (not realm or local time). They do not spawn with a backup pet, and they are fairly easy to kill. Use some low level pets (I used a level 4 and level 7) to lower the health, then you can capture with your higher pet. I picked up the quests offered outside of the meeting stone (someone had suggested doing this in order to get past the wall of fell fire), but I found a green one right as I entered the Master's Cellar (the one with the female mage at the entrance) and didn't have to go any further down (green is fine with me).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lamecode</b></h3>Appears around 8AM in central europe summer time. Just caught one 8:28 CEST, and it was a last one around so others probably despawned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DarkAingeal</b></h3>I just obtained one of these at 1155am EST. There were several in the area and they all despawned at noon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AnimeJessica</b></h3>Heads up, I did this today, and the Restless Shadelings were there at 11:09am server time. Not sure if they changed spawn times for this pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>trancer</b></h3>I had a bit of a problem figuring out from the comments what everybody meant with green fire and cellar and so on. Here are some details:<br /><br /><ul><li>You'll see the Restless Shade being underground, that is because ... they are. </li><li>The entrance to the cellars (there are two) are at the razed houses in front of Karazhan at /way 48.21, 78.43. </li><li>Both cellars have the restless shadelings in them. You'll find Archmage Alterus is standing in front of one entrance and Archmage Leryda in front of the other entrance.</li></ul><br /><br />They do respawn after a while in case you are farming for a rare. Mine appeared at 2AM server time (midnight PST).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>johsmol</b></h3>Just confirming for EU (TarrenMill). They do spawn at 24:00 server time (CET) (Give or take 30seconds). Waited from 23:50 and they spawn just a bit after midnight</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mathianas</b></h3>Showed up at 3:55 EST (12:55 PST) and they were all gone. Guess I'll try again tomorrow, I'll update this when I get one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>adrenelized</b></h3>In case you're looking for this pet: 1. it only spawns between midnight and 9am (SERVER TIME) 2. It appears in the &quot;master's cellar&quot; in Karazhan near the raid instance. 3. IT&quot;S NOT IN THE RAID INSTANCE. 4. There are 2 entrances and you can't get all the way through as there is an arcane barrier blocking the path. Each entrance has an NPC standing at the top of the stairs (in the destroyed buildings near the raid entrance) and there is an NPC &quot;archmage Aturus&quot; near the one you want (or at least for me). /way #42 47.0 75.6 Archmage Alturus The other mage is archmage Leryda - if you find her - go arcross the path to the other building to find the first NPC mentioned. Happy hunting - the drop rate on the HH breed is all I saw - I picked up an uncommon, common and a poor. I logged in to my gf's toon and got her an uncommon on first pull.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Valivice</b></h3>I have been camping this pet between 12am-9am server time (I am on an OCE server) for a few days. Today I decided to check <b>1am at PST</b> time. The pet was there - it seems the pet spawns <b>based on PST time - not server time</b>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>in2it</b></h3>Restless Shadeling breeds H/H and H/S. You fight them alone, no extra battle pets joins the fight. Their level were for me 17-18. I used two level 16 battle pets and one level 25 as backup.<br /><br />I've been checking for Restless Shadeling for a few days now. I've tried to be online around midnight and around 8-9 in the morning without seeing any, until today. Earlier I have tried with both War Mode on and off. Today when I finally saw them my War Mode was off and the time was 00:50-01:08 CET (Central European Time. I'm in Sweden). <br /><br /><b>Suggestions</b><br />War Mode OFF<br />Restless Shadelings usually spawns between midnight to 9 in the morning (00:00-09:00) server time.<br />Read more here <a href="https://www.wow-petguide.com/Pet/61375/Restless_Shadeling" rel="nofollow">https://www.wow-petguide.com/Pet/61375/Restless_Shadeling</a><br /><br />Go down the stairs to The Master's Cellar next to the Archmages Alturus or Leryda. The east and west Master's Cellar are not connected so you need to walk down both stairs to check the whole area where the Restless Shadelings might spawn. Coordinates can be found below in this post.<br /><br />East side (here I found 4 Restless Shadelings)<br />/way #42 48.6 78.9 Archmage Alturus<br />/way #42 48.7 78.8 Stair down next to Archmage Alturus - East side<br /><br />West side (here I found 10+ Restless Shadelings)<br />/way #42 47.8 78.4 Archmage Leryda<br />/way #42 47.7 78.2 Stair down next to Archmage Leryda - West side<br /><br />Happy hunting!</div>
