No idea whether it's the best or most efficient method, but here is the method that worked for me:\n\n*  As others have noted above, the cheetah cub has a chance to spawn \"with\" an adult cheetah.  So you can increase the number of cub spawns by killing the adults.  [b]However, once you see an adult with a cub, [u]do not kill the adult[\/u]-- battle the cub and move on[\/b] when it's non-rare.  The parent will spawn a new cub within 3-5 min.  If you kill the adult she may be replaced by a non-breeding adult (see below).\n\n*  If I passed by an adult more than once and she still did not have a cub, I killed her.  Usually the adult that spawned to replace her did not have a cub, either, but sometimes I seemed to get lucky and a \"non-breeding\" cheetah would be replaced by a \"breeding\" cheetah.  So if you see a chronically cubless cheetah, can't hurt to cut her down.\n\n*  Breeding cheetahs seemed to most reliably spawn at the following locations:  (1) Tree clusters around grom'gol farm, (2) tree clusters near Kala'ma and (3) tree clusters at the southern edge of The Crossroads.  Caught my rare at the Crossroads location. \n\n*  Not sure if this makes a difference, but for the majority of my search I would just forfeit any cub that turned out to be non-rare.  Eventually I decided to play it supersafe and actually battle every cub, just in case there is some mechanic penalizing forfeits.  After I stopped forfeiting and started battling it was only about 10 min before I caught my rare.  This also could have had something to do with the time of day, though -- I caught my rare pretty late at night.\n\nGood luck to everyone...this was the most difficult pet I've farmed, but well worth it.","date":"2012-11-06T00:00:48-06:00","rating":36,"indent":0,"roles":16384,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"The \"breeding cheetahs\" do indeed re spawn cubs if you don't kill them.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>carela</b></h3>These guys are found cuddling up with &quot;Plainsland Cheetahs&quot;, level 12~ cheetah npcs found underneath trees where there are no lions, all over Northern Barrens. I feel like such a jerk rolling up and fighting the baby cheetahs while they cuddle with their moms.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Beregond</b></h3>The only spawns I could find so far are:<br />- 66.3 , 71.3 outside Ratchet, west ramp, under the first large tree on the right (facing west) of the road<br />- 53.8 , 65.1 on the road from Crossroads to Ratchet, under the first large tree on the right (facing SE) of the road<br /><br />respawn takes up to 5 minutes sometimes</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>There are actually large numbers of spawns of these cubs. They do, however, seem to be on a very long timer, and only spawn in the Northern Barrens. Any tree that has Plainsland Cheetahs under them seem to also be able to spawn Cheetah Cubs. When clicked, these cubs make the same purry growl-roar that the other 'baby big cat' mobs do.<br /><br />Having not yet seen the cubs spawn, there is the possibility that, like the bear cubs, these spawn *with* the cheetahs. So if you can't find cubs, try killing some of the cheetahs and check respawns. Note: as of yet, this is only a guess. I haven't had the chance to test this theory yet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>785264</b></h3>Level: 3<br />Health: 217<br />Power: 31<br />Speed: 47<br />Rarity: Rare</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1037290</b></h3>I found a lvl 3 <u><b>rare</b> <b>cheetah cub</b></u> on the southern edge of Grol'dom Farm, in Northern Barrens. I only had a bunch of lvl 6 pets, so I fought using Mr.Chilly. His spell, Ice Lance (which deals 58 elemental damage at lvl 6), was weak enough to avoid killing the cub. The cubs only spawn under trees, beside a Plainsland Cheetah (lvl 11-12). The NPC map provided was very accurate and helpful, ty wowhead! Alkurian's stats are correct, in that the stats don't vary within quality rates. Take health points for example: 190 hp will always indicate a poor quality cheetah cub, 199 hp = common, 208 hp = uncommon, and 217 hp = rare. The lil guy is puuuurrfect ;) def worth the many hours spent searching!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Invaki</b></h3>I finally found a rare lil cub today, after many many 'unusable' lesser qualities. I'm not sure, but it seems as if rares prefer to spawn in the same places. I don't have adequate proof at this time though.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>11294</b></h3>Being an absolute cheetah lover, the first thing I need to say is that they sound nothing at all like real cheetahs.<br /><br />With that said, these little guys level very quickly in the barrens. Being a beast, they will easily beat any prairie dog you run into in the Northern Barrens. Leveling from 3-5 was very quick.<br /><br />Getting tired of that I moved to the Southern Barrens and all the critters were level 9. Using the old Pokemon trick of having the beast you want to level be first in battle and then switching him out I was able to gain a couple of levels.<br /><br />At level 7 he was then strong enough to fight the level 9 prairie dog's and the (uncapturable) gazelles that often showed up on his own. Using Devour as the finisher is key.<br /><br />Of course I named him Chester Cheetah :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1052845</b></h3>After farming for more than 3 hours, I finally caught my rare a few seconds ago. No idea whether it's the best or most efficient method, but here is the method that worked for me:<br /><br />* As others have noted above, the cheetah cub has a chance to spawn &quot;with&quot; an adult cheetah. So you can increase the number of cub spawns by killing the adults. <b>However, once you see an adult with a cub, <u>do not kill the adult</u>-- battle the cub and move on</b> when it's non-rare. The parent will spawn a new cub within 3-5 min. If you kill the adult she may be replaced by a non-breeding adult (see below).<br /><br />* If I passed by an adult more than once and she still did not have a cub, I killed her. Usually the adult that spawned to replace her did not have a cub, either, but sometimes I seemed to get lucky and a &quot;non-breeding&quot; cheetah would be replaced by a &quot;breeding&quot; cheetah. So if you see a chronically cubless cheetah, can't hurt to cut her down.<br /><br />* Breeding cheetahs seemed to most reliably spawn at the following locations: (1) Tree clusters around grom'gol farm, (2) tree clusters near Kala'ma and (3) tree clusters at the southern edge of The Crossroads. Caught my rare at the Crossroads location. <br /><br />* Not sure if this makes a difference, but for the majority of my search I would just forfeit any cub that turned out to be non-rare. Eventually I decided to play it supersafe and actually battle every cub, just in case there is some mechanic penalizing forfeits. After I stopped forfeiting and started battling it was only about 10 min before I caught my rare. This also could have had something to do with the time of day, though -- I caught my rare pretty late at night.<br /><br />Good luck to everyone...this was the most difficult pet I've farmed, but well worth it.</div>

From my experience, I have seen some spawn just under 3 hrs.. but the average seems to be 6. Don't fret, there are lots of spawn spots that you can see via way points listed on Wowhead and ones below.</li><li>The Cheetah Cubs are around lvl 3, so they will NOT show up as a 2nd or 3rd battle pet so trying to catch a rare is usually more time consuming.</li><li>Word is getting out that these Cheetah Cubs have longer spawn times than normal wild pets, making them more difficult to capture. So try hunting them during non peak hours.</li><li>Killing other Wild Pets or other Cheetah Cubs does not seem to make them spawn faster so I wouldn't waste your time.</li><li>Kill any hostiles near the Cheetah Cubs before initiating a battle (Do NOT use AOEs! It will kill cub) so you do not get interrupted and possibly loose the Cub to other players or due to lack of pet health (just in case pet healing is on CD and you are out of bandages).</li><li>Enter in /reload ui if you are in a battle and the animations freeze. It will unfreeze the animation and let you continue the battle (as long as your last surviving pet didn't die during animation). I have had this happen to me several times when fighting against a Flying pet or a Pet with Charging Abilities.</li><li>Don't be stubborn or use lag as an excuse. Get the Addons I listed below!

Devour is a nice addition, however, and can be helpful if you want to use it to level pets without having to constantly go back to a Stable Master or swap out your pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>KnightGabriel</b></h3>These guys can actually be quite strong because their set of abilities complements their speed. At max level and rare quality they have a whopping 390 speed, while boasting the &quot;pounce&quot; ability(does extra damage if user strikes first), the &quot;screech&quot; ability(reduces enemy speed for 4 rounds) and &quot;prowl&quot;(reduces speed but massive damage boost to next attack). The cheetah cub's speed is so damn high that against some pets they STILL go first when they use prowl. If the pet has a speed higher than 273, then you just need to use screech first which reduces their speed by almost as much as prowl does to you. Then use prowl and watch the carnage ensue. Against critters this combo can do well over 1k damage with a single use of pounce, and unless you're fighting a critter with either really high attack or nothing but damaging abilities it should still be alive for a couple more pounces after.</div>
