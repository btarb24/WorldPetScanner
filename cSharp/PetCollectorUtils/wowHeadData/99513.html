<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>adorina</b></h3>Caught mine in Felsoul Hold at 25,60. Took awhile of killing the Thornclaw pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aalyy</b></h3>Found one at 29, 65 in Felsoul Hold. There was a regular critter spider there so I realm hopped and first realm I joined the critter was spawned as a Vicious Broodling. A rare P/B breed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>Vicious Broodling is a rare spawn of the <a href="/npc=99528/thornclaw-broodling">Thornclaw Broodling</a>. At the moment, all the spawns are of rare quality; whether this was deliberate or not is hard to tell, but you may want to take advantage of that fact while you have the chance just in case!<br /><br />So far, every spawn I have seen is P/B.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>natassja72</b></h3>In the southern part of Felsoul Hold there is a path leading down to bottom level of Felsould Hold and all around the place there are felhunter like mobs and two or three spawn points for Thornclaw Broodlings. <br />Mobs in the upper parts were too strong for me so I only cleared Broodlings there once and went back downstairs and sat there clearing the Broodlings there.<br />After like 20 minutes I had 3 (three) Vicious Broodlings spawned nearly next to each other. All were same breeds. <br />I strongly suggest this spot if you feel running all over the upper level of Felsoul Hold dodging everything is too much for you and you want easier mode. Noone ever goes down there except the quest in the cave so the place is pretty much all yours as opposite to upper level where folks do the World Quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bizarre</b></h3>When you find one, I recommend restarting the battle if the <a href="/npc=99513/vicious-broodling">Vicious Broodling</a> has <a href="/pet-ability=1043/drain-blood">Drain Blood</a>. This will make it very difficult to capture.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>maryalice</b></h3>I caught a rare quality Vicious Broodling at 30.5, 74.3 inside the fel pit, Suramar.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>358591</b></h3>Been hunting this pet for weeks, it's my last one to find and finally I see it. I target it, move in closer and my stupid Bodyguard killed it. SMH</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>KissxMint</b></h3>Got one at 34.23, 83.45 (still rare) after battling with a pet there, a bit later it spawned in place.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>geekygirlish</b></h3>This was the last one I needed for ach. If you don't turn in the quest for &quot;In the Pit&quot; and have a class hall follower with you, you can wander around the hold freely. You can take on most adds even if you are not well geared. Even free a manasaber to add to your armoury. <br /><br />I killed all battle pets around the area, and macro to kill all broodlings. I had three vicious broodlings spawn. They were in the pit, and by the felhunter poop quest.<br /><br />Word of advice, clear all mobs before you start a pet battle. Two were killed by my entourage by accident when I was attacked by mobs. which is why I needed three to spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Livi</b></h3>Found at 28.13 81.58, on the way up from the lower level.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ConjuredBiscuit</b></h3>I found one in felsoul hold at 31.86, 63.54<br /><br />Was going around killing thornclaws to force a spawn but I hadn't got to the area yet and it was there. Might be always there, not sure.<br /><br />This is the circuit I was doing:<br /><br />/way 28.6, 67.5<br />/way 25.5, 61.7<br />/way 28.9, 56.9<br />/way 30.5, 62.6</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>thebl4ckd0g</b></h3>I have been sitting here for over an hour, killing the thornclaws to see if a vicious would spawn, but so far no luck. I've also gone into Felsoul Hold like some have suggested, but have never seen any of the spiders in there at all, so they must be limited to outside.<br /><br />EDIT: finally after 2 full hours, I found one at 28, 64 in the outside area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Speratic</b></h3>I found a rare version and killed it by accident, of course. So I circle around for 10 minutes, can't find another. So I join an Anna Mouz group and circled and found another rare one, and caught it. Just join a group for a world quest and server hop til you find it.</div>
