<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>these move around much faster than their Shimmershell compatriots. As well, they only seem to come in one color: the brown/red phase (rusty; d'uh). When clicked, they make a squeaky sort of squelching sound.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SargonStarblade</b></h3>The spawn rate of these little buggers sucks and unlike other battle pets there are no non-combat mobs that you can kill to try to speed up the spawn rate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>621343</b></h3>Was able to tame a <a href="/npc=61312/strand-crab">Strand Crab</a> as a secondary battler to a Rusty Snail</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>356640</b></h3>Rares:<br /><br />370, 46, 33 (lvl 4)<br />438, 58, 42 (lvl 5)<br /><br />Stats will vary, but should be close. Spawn rate was slow, even though no one else was around. It took about half an hour to get these two rares. Don't forget to check the islands.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>648650</b></h3>It might sound crazy, but I found that killing off all of the rats (i think there are 5 that spawn) in the Horde base in Zorem Strand makes the Rusty Snails spawn. <br /><br />I circled the area for nearly an hour and no Snails spawned. Then, I started to fight the rats in the base, because I was bored. Did another pass along the beach and 4 snails had spawned. After I fought all of the snails, the rats respawned. Wash, rinse, repeat, and I eventually got my rare Rusty Snail.<br /><br />Every time I killed the rats, more Rusty Snails spawned. Not sure if there really is a link between the two Wild Pet types, but it certainly seems like it.<br /><br />Hope this helps.</div>
