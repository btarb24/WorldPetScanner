Though I admit that I don't pvp that much with pets - so I can't comment too much about his usage there (though I'd imagine it's pretty strong).\r\n\r\nWhile H\/H isn't commonly a desirable trait combination, it fits Pinchy very well and he's an amazing tank pet. His [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/pet-ability=273]Wish[\/url] ability scales from his HP, so healing 50% at level 25 means a heal of 943 at max, on a 5 round cooldown - which is amazing. His second tanking ability [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/pet-ability=310]Shell Shield[\/url] means he takes less damage every round - making the big heal even better. \r\nFor attacks, that leaves him with only one button - but he's got two nice options. [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/pet-ability=356]Snap[\/url] is his go-to ability - doing 280 Beast damage at a 100% hit chance. The steady damage output of this ability is the key to his strength in PvE. So long as you're not facing flying creatures, this is a very nice amount of damage to do to enemy pets with 100% hit chance. His other offensive attack is [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/pet-ability=509]Surge[\/url]. Doing slightly less damage (210) per hit, again with 100% hit chance - this nullifies speed by always striking first! This can be an underrated ability, but there are many times you will definitely want the lower damage per hit ability. Anytime you face a pet with a stun, if he hits first in the round - then now you will miss the rest of that turn, then face two more attacks before you get to hit again. With [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/pet-ability=509]Surge[\/url], you've already hit in the first round, miss one round with the stun, then hit first in the 3rd round. Likewise, if you consider an ability like [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/pet-ability=283]Survival[\/url] - when it is used early in a round, that's two rounds the other pet is safe. You always striking first gives the opponent much less options.\r\n\r\nI use his other abilities much less option. [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/pet-ability=511]Renewing Mists[\/url] heals 112\/round to your front pet for 3 rounds, for a total of 336. The benefit of this is you can swap pets, and have this continue to tick. If the whole effect is intended for Pinchy, then his [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/pet-ability=310]Shell Shield[\/url] is just better - blocking 70 per attack for 5 rounds - for a total potential mitigation of 350. This also defends per attack, so takes the full amount off pets with multiple attacks (making him immune to many critter swarm abilities). His final option is [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/pet-ability=513]Whirlpool[\/url], which attacks for 420 and stops the enemy pet from being swapped for 2 rounds. It's a decent ability, just nowhere near as useful as the super healing from [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/pet-ability=273]Wish[\/url]. \r\n\r\nFor levelling other pets, you need a strong carry pet or two (since, essentially, you are going 2 pets v 3). Mr Pinchy excels here. With his steady damage output and extreme durability - there's not much that he can't face easily alone. For me, the best spot for boosting pets is the area just north of the Horde garrison area in Draenor. The two rocky areas left and right of the path leaving the north exit of the Garrison are home to countless level 23-25 Icefang Hatchlings. The companion pets are either flying (unfortunate for Pinchy) and Critter (superb for Pinchy). There is no combination that a tanky level 25 Pinchy cannot handle solo, so start with your levelling pet - get one hit in, and bring in Pinchy to finish the 3 enemy pets. If you're any way serious about pets, you have the added bonus of having the pet trainer in your garrison, so you can pop back for free healing if you ever need it (with good planning with Pinchy, you never will). \r\n\r\nFor some of the master trainer battles, it can be very difficult to do enough damage (with their 50% avoidance) to kill them while surviving. Enter Pinchy again! Start with a Cockroach and call an Apocalypse with first ability. Then bring in Pinchy and just have him tank damage, until the 15 rounds are up. It's not flashy, but it gets the job done!\r\n\r\nFor all this benefit, it doesn't even cover that Pinchy is one of the better looking pets ingame. Back in TBC (where this information is correct - it's different nowadays), you needed flying to get to the pools. Then you needed max fishing (I think 375 at the time) with the best bait (+100) and fishing gear in order to get the the 500 level to avoid the dreaded \"your fish has got away\". You had to worry about the mobs patrolling some of the areas where the pools spawned. These pools where were we got the fish for the best food buff ingame, so the area was generally always busy with other fishermen. On a PvP server, this added more troubles in getting him - since it was worth fighting over these fishing pools! Then, getting the [item=27388] was an extremely low (I think 1%?) drop chance per catch. When you got this item, you had three wishes - with each one giving you only a 20% chance of getting the pet. Oh, and using a wish was on a 2 day cooldown too! Basically, this pet was RARE. When you'd see someone with this pet - you'd know you're looking at a dedicated fisherman! So, given how difficult it was to catch him - I'd like to think that Blizzard did put a bit of extra effort into making his model look as cool as it does!\r\n\r\nAh, what a super pet Pinchy is :)","date":"2018-04-22T06:18:31-05:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":35,"id":2626800,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Aperturebug","body":"When will we get a Magical Crawmom?","date":"2018-10-28T12:58:21-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":36,"id":2879376,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Oceandust","body":"Fishing rank doesn't matter anymore for this after the profession change.

I totally realize that's completely conjecture that this affected anything, but at least make sure you have Find Fish tracking turned on.","date":"2023-01-30T21:08:38-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2023-02-02T19:56:30-06:00",1,"Nahkufu"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":48,"id":5559303,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"mekadyn","body":"It took me 239 casts to get Mr Pinchy.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Catriona</b></h3>I'm not sure exactly what is so amazing about this battle pet.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>671902</b></h3>One of the best pet for battles imho.<br /><br />Very high health pool, wish and shell shield.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ender111</b></h3>This unbalanced pet makes for a very unfun battle. Outlast teams are the worst to go up against. Simplest strategy and the battle take forever.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dervrak</b></h3>If you are not collecting, but just looking for an excellent aquatic battle pet that is almost identical to the Magical Crawdad (aka Mr. Pinchy) but is much, much easier to obtain. Take a look at the Emperor Crab that is a common drop from the shores around the Dread Wastes. It has the exact same move pool as Mr. Pinchy (sans lvl 20 Wish), which allows for the nearly unbeatable shell shield/renewing mist combo. The stats are also similar (Emperor has a little lower speed, little higher attack).<br /><br />Also if you do really want the Magical Crawdad pet, your time might be better spent farming gold, as he typically goes for about 5k-7k on the auction house (at least on my server), because, as others have stated, he can take a long, long time to fish up if you are unlucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Magneith</b></h3>I picked up 2 of these today for 670g each. I thought it was an absolute bargain. Leveled them both to 25 within an hour and a half and they're now on the AH. I really tried to keep them cheap. 3.2k each. If you want one, jump on Saurfang US and pick one up!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1253394</b></h3>This little guy is an absolute beast. I learned that the hard way in the Celestial Tournament.<br /><br />So I'm fighting Dr. Ion Goldbloom. My Emerald Proto-Drake wounded Screamer really badly, leaving only about five hundred of its health left, but Chaos and Trike took it and my Anubisath Idol down with it. The only pets left are my poor little Magical Crawdad, Jacques, and the Aquatic murder-killing Screamer.<br /><br />So I thought, &quot;This is it. I lost the tournament and have to start from the beginning.&quot;<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong. I won thanks to four very simple facts.<br /><br />1) The Magical Crawdad is not to be trifled with. Wish and Renewing Mists amount to a ridiculous level of healing that is difficult or downright impossible to stop in certain circumstances.<br /><br />2) Surge reduces any Pet Master that uses Alpha Strike (Or similar abilities) to curse-spewing babble machines.<br /><br />3) Jacques knew Surge.<br /><br />4) Screamer's main attack was Alpha Strike.<br /><br />In a flashback worthy of Ash Ketchum's weird hat-turning thing that he does when he gets super serious and is about to win a tough battle, all of these things came to me as I remembered how irritating the Golden Civets were whenever I used my Crow to level up my pets in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. So I kept up Renewing Mists and Wish, then spammed Surge until my fingers were numb.<br /><br />Keep this little guy and never let go. The Magical Crawdad is... well, magical.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sleepwalk1949</b></h3>Help. I have been fishing now for around 1,500 successful catches and still don't have Mr Pinchy, let alone a Magical Crawdad. I'm fishing only the schools of fish pinned on the cheat map - 3 in the smallest lake to lots in the largest and have had no luck at all. I'm a zen master with a nice rod and sharpened hooks that up my skill by 100 but nothing helps. The only thing I don't understand is why you refer to them as 'mixed schools'. Swimming around together in a circle as they do, they look pretty uniform to me. Not mixed at all. If I'm doing anything wrong please let me know.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Haulsen</b></h3>His kit works way too well of PvP Pet battles, <br />he can take an entire comp with low burst down alone, just like teroclaw, only he has even less counters than it.<br />Really unfun to play against.<br /><br />if you are having trouble against someone with him on his comp i'd recommend taking a team with double <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=256/call-darkness">Darkness</a>/<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=517/nocturnal-strike">Nocturnal Strike</a>.<br />Pets with &quot;forces highest enemy pet to swap into battle may also work.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=273/wish">Wish</a> per se is a PITA, but combined with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=509/surge">Surge</a>, wich counters most basic fillers from fliers (<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=184/quills">Quills</a>/<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=504/alpha-strike">Alpha Strike</a>) AND <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=310/shell-shield">Shell Shield</a> to top it off, reducing multistrike abilitie's dmg even further, countering ALSO <a href="http://" rel="nofollow">Slicing Wind</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=870/murder">Murder</a>, <a href="http://" rel="nofollow">Falcosaur Swarm</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=581/flock">Flock</a>, etc. Making very few Flying abilities viable to hurt it inside it's hard shell and disabling any chance to apply the Shattered Defenses debuff on him.<br /><br />We see a similar situation against an <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=65203/emperor-crab">Emperor Crab</a>, but it's effective healing depend on it's power, making his health pool bearable to deal with, and if he chooses HH over PP, it's effective heal won't be much of a problem.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>xRodge</b></h3>For me, Magical Crawdad (I'll refer to him as Mr Pinchy) is one of the very best pets ingame. Though I admit that I don't pvp that much with pets - so I can't comment too much about his usage there (though I'd imagine it's pretty strong).<br /><br />While H/H isn't commonly a desirable trait combination, it fits Pinchy very well and he's an amazing tank pet. His <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=273">Wish</a> ability scales from his HP, so healing 50% at level 25 means a heal of 943 at max, on a 5 round cooldown - which is amazing. His second tanking ability <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=310">Shell Shield</a> means he takes less damage every round - making the big heal even better. <br />For attacks, that leaves him with only one button - but he's got two nice options. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=356">Snap</a> is his go-to ability - doing 280 Beast damage at a 100% hit chance. The steady damage output of this ability is the key to his strength in PvE. So long as you're not facing flying creatures, this is a very nice amount of damage to do to enemy pets with 100% hit chance. His other offensive attack is <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=509">Surge</a>. Doing slightly less damage (210) per hit, again with 100% hit chance - this nullifies speed by always striking first! This can be an underrated ability, but there are many times you will definitely want the lower damage per hit ability. Anytime you face a pet with a stun, if he hits first in the round - then now you will miss the rest of that turn, then face two more attacks before you get to hit again. With <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=509">Surge</a>, you've already hit in the first round, miss one round with the stun, then hit first in the 3rd round. Likewise, if you consider an ability like <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=283">Survival</a> - when it is used early in a round, that's two rounds the other pet is safe. You always striking first gives the opponent much less options.<br /><br />I use his other abilities much less option. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=511">Renewing Mists</a> heals 112/round to your front pet for 3 rounds, for a total of 336. The benefit of this is you can swap pets, and have this continue to tick. If the whole effect is intended for Pinchy, then his <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=310">Shell Shield</a> is just better - blocking 70 per attack for 5 rounds - for a total potential mitigation of 350. This also defends per attack, so takes the full amount off pets with multiple attacks (making him immune to many critter swarm abilities). His final option is <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=513">Whirlpool</a>, which attacks for 420 and stops the enemy pet from being swapped for 2 rounds. It's a decent ability, just nowhere near as useful as the super healing from <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=273">Wish</a>. <br /><br />For levelling other pets, you need a strong carry pet or two (since, essentially, you are going 2 pets v 3). Mr Pinchy excels here. With his steady damage output and extreme durability - there's not much that he can't face easily alone. For me, the best spot for boosting pets is the area just north of the Horde garrison area in Draenor. The two rocky areas left and right of the path leaving the north exit of the Garrison are home to countless level 23-25 Icefang Hatchlings. The companion pets are either flying (unfortunate for Pinchy) and Critter (superb for Pinchy). There is no combination that a tanky level 25 Pinchy cannot handle solo, so start with your levelling pet - get one hit in, and bring in Pinchy to finish the 3 enemy pets. If you're any way serious about pets, you have the added bonus of having the pet trainer in your garrison, so you can pop back for free healing if you ever need it (with good planning with Pinchy, you never will). <br /><br />For some of the master trainer battles, it can be very difficult to do enough damage (with their 50% avoidance) to kill them while surviving. Enter Pinchy again! Start with a Cockroach and call an Apocalypse with first ability. Then bring in Pinchy and just have him tank damage, until the 15 rounds are up. It's not flashy, but it gets the job done!<br /><br />For all this benefit, it doesn't even cover that Pinchy is one of the better looking pets ingame. Back in TBC (where this information is correct - it's different nowadays), you needed flying to get to the pools. Then you needed max fishing (I think 375 at the time) with the best bait (+100) and fishing gear in order to get the the 500 level to avoid the dreaded &quot;your fish has got away&quot;. You had to worry about the mobs patrolling some of the areas where the pools spawned. These pools where were we got the fish for the best food buff ingame, so the area was generally always busy with other fishermen. On a PvP server, this added more troubles in getting him - since it was worth fighting over these fishing pools! Then, getting the <a href="/item=27388/mr-pinchy">Mr. Pinchy</a> was an extremely low (I think 1%?) drop chance per catch. When you got this item, you had three wishes - with each one giving you only a 20% chance of getting the pet. Oh, and using a wish was on a 2 day cooldown too! Basically, this pet was RARE. When you'd see someone with this pet - you'd know you're looking at a dedicated fisherman! So, given how difficult it was to catch him - I'd like to think that Blizzard did put a bit of extra effort into making his model look as cool as it does!<br /><br />Ah, what a super pet Pinchy is :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>unit00</b></h3>384 casts and got him today. dropped crawdad on the first wish. i was watching netflix while doing it and it was a lot less painful that way. <br /><br />most of my casts were on my lvl 60 with 100 outland fishing, but i got him on a different lvl 60 with 59 outland fishing (started from 0). probably doesn't matter, but just if you want the info.<br /><br />good luck to you if you're fishing for him!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>NastyPope</b></h3>Don't hate me...<br /><br />Decided to start collecting some of the better/more useful pets. Tracked down a rare Emerald Proto-Whelp and an uncommon Kun-Lai Runt yesterday, and decided that today would be a good day to start working on a Magical Crawdad, so I jumped on my 801 fishing Demon Hunter and headed to Terrokar. 3rd pool, first cast, got Mr. Pinchy, and first use got me my Magical Crawdad. The rest of my life may be crap right now, but that made my freakin' day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dawn22868</b></h3>I went to Skettis to max out my Outland fishing (was at around 50) and got the first <a href="/item=27388/mr-pinchy">Mr. Pinchy</a> after 21 casts which luckily gave me the pet first try.<br />Got another <a href="/item=27388/mr-pinchy">Mr. Pinchy</a> a few minutes after. <br /><br /><a href="https://imgur.com/a/X1ZAGzp" rel="nofollow">https://imgur.com/a/X1ZAGzp</a><br /><br />I q'ed for pvp bet battles along the way to reduce downtime and get some variety while fishing and recommend doing the same.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Blueyan</b></h3>I actively farmed these pets a few years ago after realising that the drop rate seemed much higher than when I had got my first. I suspect it may have been nerfed again as it took me over 500 casts this time to get Mr Pinchy</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nahkufu</b></h3>TL;DR: Fished on an alt with zero Outland Fishing skill, caught it after about 100 catches later. I realize this is conjecture, but I caught it first cast after turning on &quot;find fish&quot; tracking. Got the pet on first wish. Not sure if they buffed droprate or just luck. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bppuKOL.png" rel="nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/bppuKOL.png</a><br /><br />(edit: ok, man, I don't know what's going on but I got a magical crawdad on all three wishes. Not sure if this is broken or what. Prices are definitely lower than they were on the AH.) <br /><br />I figured I'd try to farm this for some gold, I only had the one I got back when BC originally came out and I forgot how I got it and wanted to keep it for nostalgia, so here I am looking at comments for how to get it since I completely forgot. <br /><br />I figured I'd start with an old alt on a low-pop server that previously had maxed fishing but with the profession rework, my &quot;Outland Fishing&quot; was 0. I went fishing anyway to try my luck. I noticed I didn't have the find fish tracking skill, so I set out up the rivers around the Horde and Alliance towns in the zone looking for schools. Eventually I went to Skettis and began seeing the Highland Mixed schools and started fishin. At some point I checked my tracking options again, and I had &quot;find fish&quot; now. I don't know if you now get it from the achievement for fishing from a school or what, I was trying to fish up the old <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=34109/weather-beaten-journal">weather-beaten journal</a> that you used to learn it from... <br /><br />Anyway, my first cast after turning on &quot;find fish&quot; caught Mr Pinchy. I totally realize that's completely conjecture that this affected anything, but at least make sure you have Find Fish tracking turned on.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mekadyn</b></h3>It took me 239 casts to get Mr Pinchy. On the first wish I got the pet! I started at fishing 1 and got maxed at some point during those casts.</div>
