<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kruithne</b></h3>A fair amount of people have reported problems getting this pet. From what I've found (via my own testing and comments from my friends) you need to be dismounted AND in line-of-sight of the candle when cheering at it.<br /><br />The pet spawns in multiple places in Dalaran on a 5-10 minute respawn timer. When targeting it, you may notice the nameplate appears way up in the air, the candle itself is actually down on the ground which is where you need to stand.<br /><br />For the best success, simply stand directly on-top of the candle, dismounted, and /cheer at it three times. The wick of the candle should light up when you start cheering at it, indicating that it's working.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>09mackinnonr</b></h3>its worth noting that multiple people can get it at once from the same location because me and another guy got it at the same time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lordmonkeypants</b></h3>I was just sitting in Dalaran waiting for my timewalking dungeon LFG to pop when I got this. I did nothing to get it. Can I get a confirmation that this appears without having to cheer yourself to obtain it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mzbehavin</b></h3>found at 37/31 in between the tailor and leatherworker hidden behind the fire brazier<br />do /cheer x 3 and the candle sparks up and ends up in your pet inventory.<br />it is a non combat pet<br />best way to find it is to make a macro /neth<br />respawn was about 15/20 minutes next place it respawned was outside the enchanters on the corner at 42/42</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>akenatoth</b></h3>I used a /target macro to find the pet. Targeted it twice without actually seeing it, cheered around 10 times anyway with the only result of making the pet disappear (without getting it).<br /><br />Then my coffee finally started to wake me up and I selected &quot;target&quot; only on the minimap icons, found the pet again, went close to it and cheered 3/4 times and finally got it.<br /><br />I'm not 100% sure but it seems that distance from the pet itself might be a factor in actually getting it after cheering at it.<br /><br />&lt;3 Nethaera</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>416271</b></h3>Just wanted to add, that you'll need to be directly near/under the candle AND dismounted for this to work (at least as of 6/29/2015). <u>The idea; and what finally worked for me, is to be in the little AOE spark that the candle will send out after enough /cheer(s) have been emoted on it.</u> Just think of it as exciting the candle- and wanting to get caught up in its blast! :P<br /><br />If you look at <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/user=Celesti">Celesti</a>'s <a href="http://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/472016.jpg" rel="nofollow">screen shot</a> of the idle pet animation, you'll see in the third pane the small AOE spark that the NPC version will send out once enough /cheer(s) have been emoted, and the very same AOE you'll need to stand in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>crystallyn</b></h3>Agree with a lot of other posters. This thing is very picky in that you have to do it the precise way to get it. I made a /tar netha macro in addition to a /cheer macro as I read you might have to cheer a lot to get it.<br /><br />I tried cheering when I wasn't close enough and that didn't work. Also had issues in finding it as when I put a raid marker on it, the raid marker and name plate was way up high. I went to cheer for it up near the name plate/raid marker and that didn't work either. <br /><br />Not sure if dismounting is important, but others said it might cause issues so I made sure I did that. So when I eventually got it, I found it using the targeting macro and I put a raid marker on it. Since it's kinda buggy, the raid marker was way up high along with the name plate, so I looked down below it, found the candle there. I flew really close to it, dismounted and facing the candle, I spammed the cheer macro. People claimed that they only had to cheer 3 times, but I had to cheer about 15 times before it popped into my pet journal.<br /><br />When you cheer at it, the light from the candle gets brighter and you know you finally got the pet when a little firework animation goes off (as long as you're close enough). <br /><br />The pet itself occasionally does the little firework animation. Unfortunately you can't make the pet do it on command. I tried cheering at the pet and it does nothing :(<br /><br />I ended up finding mine in front of the wine and cheese shop. But I've found it spawned in many other places during my failed attempts. Instead of just camping a spot, I just recommend flying around spamming the /tar macro.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>skyline33</b></h3>Got this thing on my first /cheer<br />Bottom of the stairs leading up to the Flight Path</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rawford</b></h3>I just found one at 62/44 just before you go up the stairs on the way to the flight path, right in between the two stair cases. <br /><br />It took 15 /cheers before i got the pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>javban</b></h3>A friend and I hunted this pet down today. It took a few passes and a few misses but we finally got it. I think there's a few things that can help others, so I'm sharing my experience. When I found it I quickly spotted it, and landed next to it. I accidentally /clucked at it first, since I put the wrong macro on my bar. I quickly typed /cheer and instantly got it after 1 cheer. the other person in my party also got it as they were nearby as well, even though they did not cheer at it. I also did not dismount from my sandstone drake. it quickly disappeared afterwards.<br /><br />So to quickly recap.<br />- I was mounted on my sandstone drake when I got it (not riding someone else)<br />- I cheered once and I instantly got the pet<br />- the other person nearby in my party also received the pet<br />- it disappeared quickly after cheered at<br /><br />Good luck to all you pet hunters out there :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nokomanida</b></h3>Confirmed as of today that if you /cheer it however many times required while in a party, ALL party members can receive it it seems. Only had 2 in the party but im assuming it will work with atleast up to 5 people.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Narinae</b></h3>Track pets does not work on it. I just found it while I had pet tracking on, but it wasn't showing up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>murglesnout</b></h3>Found it twice in a row (within five minutes) right outside the cheese shop in Dalaran, to the right of the entrance right beside the wall. The first time I spotted it I invited a friend to the party, did around 10 /cheers (he did nothing) and he got the pet and I got nothing. Another circuit of Dalaran searching brought me back to the same place a few minutes later finding it in the same spot and being the only one in the party at this point, I did get it the second time and after only three cheers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kjn2day1</b></h3>Found it outside the mining building</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>thesponge</b></h3>I found this just this morning in Dalaran at coords: <b>58.19, 52.05 </b><br />For those of you without coords, to the right of the shop<b> &quot;The Hunter's Reach&quot;</b>, it has a tiny sign on the ground, it is right next to it, between <b>Aerith Primrose's</b> flower stand. <b>I used the emote /cheer three times to obtain it as a battle pet, it automatically added to my journal</b>, however other posts say it may take more /cheer's, I am not sure. It is on the ground, like a teeny weeny candle, at first glance it looks like just decoration. The nameplate for this NPC is 15 ft in the air or so above it, so that's how I noticed it in the first place, a random floating nameplate lol. Good luck to those who are hunting it !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Yalianna</b></h3>Found in Dalaran at coordinates 37.47, 31.19 around 3:57pm CST on Illidan. Cheered at it once, it started to glow, cheered twice and it was a pet in my journal and despawned. Good luck everyone. Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mondoblasto</b></h3>Cheered once and got it. (Under the streetlight by Windle Sparkshine.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LiriellGarrosh</b></h3>I was grouped with a friend and we both got it at the same time. The NPC disappeared after a brief fireworks display.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JusticarCien</b></h3>Got mine today, saw this strange candle hovering under the street light directly outside 'Simply Enchanting' in Dalaran. <br /><br />Can confirm it takes 3x /cheers while not mounted. After the 2nd cheer, the flame of the candle sparks and ignites intensely, the 3rd cheer makes it glow and adds it to your pet journal, where the NPC will despawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>KerynTB</b></h3>If you are locating it by using a targeting macro, be aware that the nameplate is very high up in the air. Cheering up by the nameplate will despawn the candle without giving you the pet!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Oriphine</b></h3>After reading about Nethaera's Light on Facebook (thank you, Life of Warcraft!), I logged to my Horde Mage and teleported to Dalaran. Hit /tar Neth upon landing and got a hit. Walked around the area until I found it, right in the little alcove between the left and right stairs just inside Krasus' Landing. /cheered only twice and I got it. Good luck all!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>IvikN</b></h3>Dangit. For some reason /t didn't work for me.

I cheered only once and got it a few seconds later. I think the reason people are convinced they had to cheer multiple times is because there was no feedback indicating that you cheered correctly, so they instinctively spammed it until something happened.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MatchstickDB</b></h3>Have to be in Dalaran Northrend before Broken Isles, If alliance use the portal in the mage tower to get to it. Respawns every 5-10 minutes and the player must target the candle and type /cheer a randomized number of times between 2 and 15. once the candle is your friend it will give you a screen notification saying it had been added to your pet journal. Found mine in front of the stairs of the Krasus landing sanctuary between the Magical Menagerie and The Hunters Reach buildings. Refer to image above for what the candle looks like, happy hunting!<br />September 16th 2022</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mathianas</b></h3>Found today in Old Dal, first in a tree in the profession area (across from where the Alch shop is in New Dal), and then between the Alliance bank and the fishing fountain about five minutes later. It may not even have been a full five minutes.<br />I was spamming /tar /cheer and while it successfully targetted and /cheered, I wasn't present when the flash went off and didn't get the pet. The second time, I just did /target and when i found it, I landed in front of it and /cheered one time. After a few seconds, there was a burst of sparks and I received my new pet.</div>
