Fortunately, it has both P\/P and S\/S as available breeds!\n\n[b][u]First slot: [petability=1353] vs. [petability=122][\/u][\/b]\nNeedless to say, your pet's speed will determine which of the two is better - with S\/S breeds favoring [b]Arcane Slash[\/b] and anything slower going with [b]Tail Sweep[\/b]. \nNote that, [b]Arcane Slash[\/b] is very effective against [petability=239] pets, but you won't be faster than them, at least at the start of the fight; so you may want to use a different Dragonkin if you want to specifically slay Flyers (such as [npc=68845] or [npc=68850])\n\n[b][u]Second slot: [petability=405] vs. [petability=569][\/u][\/b]\nAs with all stuns, they're much better if your pet goes first; as it'll also interrupt the attack this round - so [b]Crystal Prison[\/b] will be best in the hands of the S\/S whelp. \n[b]Early Advantage[\/b] isn't as straight-forward - It can be quite deadly in the hands of a Power-heavy Whelpling, but due to the way the ability works (calculating the 2nd hit based on enemy health [i]after[\/i] the first hit) it is also easier to use for a speedy Whelpling.\n\n[b][u]Last slot: [petability=170] vs. [petability=589][\/u][\/b]\n[b]Lift-Off[\/b] has two completely different uses, depending on your whelpling's breed. In the hands of a S\/S whelp, it's can be used preemptitively for avoidance; while in the hands of a P\/P one, it's a hard-hitter that will often trigger your [petability=245] passive straight away. More predictable, but also more punishing of swaps (or lack of thereof). For both breeds, and in PvE mostly, it can also be used to delay [petability=245] so that it's available when next pet swaps in; so it has some added strategic value.\nFinally, [b]Arcane Storm[\/b] can be used as an AoE (and, since 6.0, also as a single-target nuke), but is counter-sinergetic with [b]Crystal Prison[\/b]; so it'll be best suited to a P\/P breed.\n\nOverall, the S\/S breed offers the most \"unique\" gameplay; with the P\/P breed being very similar to its corrupted sibling, the [npc=68820], while also having less attack.\n\nEdit: It has been discovered that it also comes on the H\/P and H\/S breeds. As one would expect, those two breeds are terrible for battling (with H\/S being the worst), not fitting any niche at all and making the task of getting the desired breed that much harder.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Regent2203</b></h3>Am I just lucky? Got 2 of them while doing new quests, no farming at all. Like... &lt;100 mobs killed for 2 boxes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Magneith</b></h3>Dang, was this frustrating! I did the quest lines on my main and started to farm, no luck for about an hour. I decided to get my killing machine (arms warrior) and started massacring all manner of Orc, no matter the title or elite status. I was dropping the elites 6 - 10 at a time. For 6 hours, nothing. I ended up with over 500 grey items, the armor &amp; weapon fragments. Logged off in frustration and went to bed.<br /><br />Logged on today and had one 10 min into my session. I would suggest for future farmers of this, if you're not having any luck, don't go for as long as I did. Try the new dungeon or quests on other toons and come back later.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>elfomal</b></h3>Its worth to say that this one is the ultimate pet for killing flying ones =) Alongside with the nexus whelpling.<br /><br />&quot;theory' Drop rate seens to be around 0,1%, i had a total of 918 kills to get my 2 drops, Really not sure about it, only especulation.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Reckish</b></h3>From my testing these seem to have a 1/500 drop chance and drop from any mob in the invasion, so we just need to find the high mob density spot or something that instaspawns. (Instaspawns were nerfed).<br /><br /> There are several good spots available, but the best so far seems to be the Nethergarde Mines (<a href="http://youtu.be/G2u200pgYDI" rel="nofollow">Guide available here</a>). Entrances are located approximately at coordinates (50,10) just west of Nethergarde Keep and north of the baddies. The mines themselves are not good to farm without a dedicated route because enemies have the normal 5 minute respawn timer, but there are a ton of mobs if you do it well. <br /> Hop up the first alcove on the left and follow along the corridor. Ignore any bridges or side passages on the right. Clear out all the groups of 4 and 7 and bunch them together if you can. When you hit the end where there are ghosts, jump down, kill the ghosts, and run towards the minecart track where the 4 <a href="/npc=77721/ironmarch-grenadier">Ironmarch Grenadier</a>Ironmarch Grenadier are. Stay up and on the path to the left. After 3 <a href="/npc=78921/ironmarch-foreman">Ironmarch Foreman</a>Ironmarch Foremen, you should be back where you started, although you can clear out the entrance again if you're a lock or monk and just super quick.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Golgoth</b></h3>The <a href="/npc=7546/bronze-whelpling">Bronze Whelpling</a> sports a skillset that greatly depends on speed (for the better or for the worse). Fortunately, it has both P/P and S/S as available breeds!<br /><br /><b><u>First slot: <a href="/pet-ability=1353/arcane-slash">Arcane Slash</a> vs. <a href="/pet-ability=122/tail-sweep">Tail Sweep</a></u></b><br />Needless to say, your pet's speed will determine which of the two is better - with S/S breeds favoring <b>Arcane Slash</b> and anything slower going with <b>Tail Sweep</b>. <br />Note that, <b>Arcane Slash</b> is very effective against <a href="/pet-ability=239/flying">Flying</a> pets, but you won't be faster than them, at least at the start of the fight; so you may want to use a different Dragonkin if you want to specifically slay Flyers (such as <a href="/npc=68845/nexus-whelpling">Nexus Whelpling</a> or <a href="/npc=68850/emerald-proto-whelp">Emerald Proto-Whelp</a>)<br /><br /><b><u>Second slot: <a href="/pet-ability=405/early-advantage">Early Advantage</a> vs. <a href="/pet-ability=569/crystal-prison">Crystal Prison</a></u></b><br />As with all stuns, they're much better if your pet goes first; as it'll also interrupt the attack this round - so <b>Crystal Prison</b> will be best in the hands of the S/S whelp. <br /><b>Early Advantage</b> isn't as straight-forward - It can be quite deadly in the hands of a Power-heavy Whelpling, but due to the way the ability works (calculating the 2nd hit based on enemy health <i>after</i> the first hit) it is also easier to use for a speedy Whelpling.<br /><br /><b><u>Last slot: <a href="/pet-ability=170/lift-off">Lift-Off</a> vs. <a href="/pet-ability=589/arcane-storm">Arcane Storm</a></u></b><br /><b>Lift-Off</b> has two completely different uses, depending on your whelpling's breed. In the hands of a S/S whelp, it's can be used preemptitively for avoidance; while in the hands of a P/P one, it's a hard-hitter that will often trigger your <a href="/pet-ability=245/dragonkin">Dragonkin</a> passive straight away. More predictable, but also more punishing of swaps (or lack of thereof). For both breeds, and in PvE mostly, it can also be used to delay <a href="/pet-ability=245/dragonkin">Dragonkin</a> so that it's available when next pet swaps in; so it has some added strategic value.<br />Finally, <b>Arcane Storm</b> can be used as an AoE (and, since 6.0, also as a single-target nuke), but is counter-sinergetic with <b>Crystal Prison</b>; so it'll be best suited to a P/P breed.<br /><br />Overall, the S/S breed offers the most &quot;unique&quot; gameplay; with the P/P breed being very similar to its corrupted sibling, the <a href="/npc=68820/infinite-whelpling">Infinite Whelpling</a>, while also having less attack.<br /><br />Edit: It has been discovered that it also comes on the H/P and H/S breeds. As one would expect, those two breeds are terrible for battling (with H/S being the worst), not fitting any niche at all and making the task of getting the desired breed that much harder. At worst, they are still good for collection purposes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>deathhawkk</b></h3>I spent about 45 minutes in the Nethergarde Mines killing NPC's and finally got it to drop. I'll submit a screenshot of the exact location inside the mines of where the mob was that dropped it. The Nethergarde mines are located in the blasted land. Head due North and it will be at the top of the map where the mountains are.. Take the portal which is located next to the mage trainer in the Cleft of Shadows located in Orgrimmar to get to the blasted lands. The NPC's located here are level 90. Just keep trying and you will eventually get a blue item dropped called &quot;Time-locked box&quot;. This is the Bronze whelping, so don't throw it out now realizing what it is. This is the best information I can give based off my experience. Oh and you don't have to have W.o.D. to have them drop. Best of luck, just keep killing the guys located inside of here. (First post sorry if it's the greatest or in the correct format).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dkcampo</b></h3>Dropped for me today from a forager after an 1 hour. As a moonkin lvl 100 you just can pass by with star fall and you only have stop to loot the corpses. I was just killing the mobs that wowhead says can drop the pet.<br /><br />I found the best way to farm this is make a route between okrillon hold and NetherGarde Keep, killing just the outside mobs and ignoring the inner mines and forts. Ill try to clarify the drop table trying to get another pet killing only ogres and ill post my data.<br /><br />Happy hunting :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cjmorrissey</b></h3>Bronze Whelpling is contained in a Time-Locked Box dropped by iron horde forces in Blasted Lands. I got 2 of them in 1/2020 in the cave located at 60, 29 - though others are saying Okril'lon Hold (42, 13) may be a better spot. Regardless, drop rate is very low, less than 1%. The good news is that respawns are very frequent in these areas.<br /><br /><a href="/item=118675/time-locked-box">Time-Locked Box</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sinvanor</b></h3>As others said, Okril'lon Hold is the best place to farm this. Even going inside the strong hold if you just get the two inside and then circle around the stairs, go up the stairs, get all the ones in the loop outside and then the boss upstairs and back down, they will have respawned by the time you've looped.<br /><br />650 kills and nothing. The whole concept of setting any number of kills as a time frame to get it is dubious because your chances don't increase each x amount of tries. it's the same odds for every kill. Meaning a 1%&lt; chance each kill 1%&lt; every time. Theoretically you could get it at any number of kills 1 or 30,000 and your odds are exactly the same. <br /><br />I heard they might be changing this SL, but I'm not sure. Drop chance being stagnant every kill and not increasing with x amount of tries is bad RNG mechanics, unless it's something meant to be super legendary and extra rare, which pets really shouldn't count as.</div>
