So that's 20 rare pets in 35 minutes, not too shabby.\r\n\r\nDont forget to release a Sand Kitten when you hit the 3 pet limit!\r\n\r\nSo yeah, if you know of a Sandstorm going on and need the achievement, head over to tanaris and watch those rares roll in  (Or not, in the case that I am indeed the luckiest person alive and 14 rares in a row was just.. coincidence, in which case you can shout and yell at me for being an idiot )","date":"2013-01-06T05:16:02-06:00","rating":-11,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":7,"id":1803661,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"passionfruit","body":"I found several rare Sand Kittens as secondaries to Silithid Hatchlings during a sandstorm in Gaping Chasm.

There would be around 15-20 Infinite Whelps here (until they stop spawning outside) and when I cleared the whole courtyard, I've seen 4 Sand Kittens as secondaries. None were a rare, but I like the odds here. I'm parking an unused alt to check them all from time to time. The spawn time is not short if you stay only outside, but I find this method preferable to fly over Tanaris over and over again, fighting everything in sight. If you can be bothered, go inside and farm the ones inside as well.\n\nEdit: Some more stats. Did inside the cavern as well as outside this time, just one pass, clearing all pets. Rates seem to be constant both inside the caverns (down) and outside. My overall rate is 14 sand kitten secondaries \/ 58 whelp pet battles. Still no rares, of course. This annoying kitty is one of my last 3 non-rare wild pets over whole Azeroth. I'm looking forward no not flying over Tanaris, ever again.\n\nAgain, to emphasize, I'm guessing this would be more or less the same around the whole region. I'm not saying whelp secondaries have more kitties; I just like to have all my battles around one single spot to avoid flying all over the place.

I found one once every 15 or so minutes. Hope this helps.<br /><br />I came back to Taranis today (one day after my first post). And have found like 5 running around the desert under Gadgetzan.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1045117</b></h3>I also found this as a secondary pet. Spent a long time looking for a primary one, but finally gave that up and engaged everything I found. The sand kitten joined on my tenth fight or so. It was a poor, but I have one now :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Donnicton</b></h3>Sand Kittens can also occasionally appear as an add when initiating combat with one of the other pets in Tanaris, so they are not only specific to their own spawns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>barkles</b></h3>Got as a secondary to a stinkbug</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>xomegax1</b></h3>I received a one as a secondary to a desert spider myself. Like others, it took 10-15 battles to get one and the one I got was of poor quality. Ah well, I'll upgrade it later when given the chance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Prismical</b></h3>You will need some patience for that one. It took me some 37 fights to get a common version as a second to a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=61440">Stripe-Tailed Scorpid</a>. All fights were close to Gadgetzan.<br /><br />Of course if you already got your rare <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62317">minfernal</a> you know what patience is about ...<br /><br />Edit: found other Sand Kitten as secondary to <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62258">Silithid Hatchling</a> while farming for a rare during a Sand Storm in The Gasping Chasm. In terms of stats I had 7 Sand Kittens as second to Silithids in 56 fights; which is a mere 12,5% turn up rate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>981726</b></h3>The achievement in question is &quot;Quality &amp; Quantity&quot; - Collect 50 rare quality battle pets.<br /><br />Now, in Tanaris, there is a Sandstorm weather effect which comes occasionally and lasts for between ~40 minutes to ~2 hours.<br /><br />You can only get the Silithid Hatchling during this weather effect - They're level 13-14 pets, as are all the secondary pets that join.<br /><br />The pet itself isnt too strong, but it's quite a rare pet due to the weather requirement. (A *bit* less rare now as Blizz buffed the spawn times during the sandstorm so they keep spawning for the entire duration).<br /><br />Here's the interesting part :<br /><br />When you battle the Silithid Hatchling, you often get a Sand Kitten come as a secondary pet - but for some reason, during the Sandstorm, ALL Sand Kittens that come as secondary pets are RARE when you have the Silithid Hatchling as the 1st pet (Doesnt matter what quality the Silithid Hatchling is).<br /><br />I got 14 Sand Kittens as secondary pets, every single one was rare! :O<br /><br />You can battle normal Sand Kittens around Tanaris during the sandstorm, but they dont seem to have the same ratio of rares - this only occurs when you battle the Silithid Hatchlings and the Sand Kitten is a secondary pet it seems.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is intended, a bug or I'm the luckiest person alive to get 14 rares in a row, but I went from 30 rare pets captured to 50 in about ~35 minutes. (14 sand kittens, 3 silithid hatchlings, 1 beetle, 1 scorpion, 1 spider). So that's 20 rare pets in 35 minutes, not too shabby.<br /><br />Dont forget to release a Sand Kitten when you hit the 3 pet limit!<br /><br />So yeah, if you know of a Sandstorm going on and need the achievement, head over to tanaris and watch those rares roll in (Or not, in the case that I am indeed the luckiest person alive and 14 rares in a row was just.. coincidence, in which case you can shout and yell at me for being an idiot )</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>passionfruit</b></h3>I found several rare Sand Kittens as secondaries to Silithid Hatchlings during a sandstorm in Gaping Chasm. I was pretty surprised considering I had spent hours everywhere else in Tanaris trying to find one better than uncommon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Djehuty</b></h3>If you look long enough, you'll eventually find a rare <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62257">Sand Kitten</a>. I just engaged all battle pets i met. As other people write, I also found mine near <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/faction=369">Gadgetzan</a>. Guess they're crazy about that place...<br /><br />Happy hunting :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1062573</b></h3>This is an extremely rare primary spawn, but it's a pretty common secondary spawn. When hunting this pet, either for first kills or rares, I highly suggest pulling every pet you find in the zone, including Sea Gulls. You'd be lucky if you find more than 2 spawns of this pet at ANY time throughout the zone (of course, it is random), so you'll probably need to rely on the getting this through a secondary pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Stryker666</b></h3>Be careful with what abilities you use.<br /><br />Found my first ever Sand Kitten and it was Rare.<br />When to press Switch Pet to get out my Terrible Turnip and hit a multi round attack on my Arcane Eye.<br /><br />Smushed Kitty =(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rhonnieceian</b></h3>Found him by Gadgetzan, battled a sea gull, and there he was :))</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>aspasito</b></h3>Another good farming spot is just outside the Caverns of Time entrance. There would be around 15-20 Infinite Whelps here (until they stop spawning outside) and when I cleared the whole courtyard, I've seen 4 Sand Kittens as secondaries. None were a rare, but I like the odds here. I'm parking an unused alt to check them all from time to time. The spawn time is not short if you stay only outside, but I find this method preferable to fly over Tanaris over and over again, fighting everything in sight. If you can be bothered, go inside and farm the ones inside as well.<br /><br />Edit: Some more stats. Did inside the cavern as well as outside this time, just one pass, clearing all pets. Rates seem to be constant both inside the caverns (down) and outside. My overall rate is 14 sand kitten secondaries / 58 whelp pet battles. Still no rares, of course. This annoying kitty is one of my last 3 non-rare wild pets over whole Azeroth. I'm looking forward no not flying over Tanaris, ever again.<br /><br />Again, to emphasize, I'm guessing this would be more or less the same around the whole region. I'm not saying whelp secondaries have more kitties; I just like to have all my battles around one single spot to avoid flying all over the place. And while Silithid Hatchlings probably have the same secondaries, one is not so lucky to find a sandstorm everytime..<br /><br />One last edit: Got my rare kitten, after 400+ battles with infinite whelps. Hope you will be luckier than I was!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1244383</b></h3>I spent about 2 hours around Gagetzan before finally finding one as a secondary. I had much more luck over at the Caverns of Time fighting Infinite Whelplings. Of the 8 battle I did, 5 of them had a sand kitten as a secondary, and the final battle was a rare. Hope this helps :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kittycatcharm</b></h3>Got mine just south of Gadgetzan. It was the 2nd for a yellow snake thing (wasn't paying attention, since I wanted the cat). First thing I fought in Tanaris when I went to get my kitten :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>carneval</b></h3>Getting a rare Sand Kitten is kinda challenging as this battle pet does not have a proper spawn point and relying on secondary spawn can take quite long. <br /><br />There is a mention of Caverns of Time where is large population of Infinite Whelps that spawn Sand Kitten as secondary pet (approx every 4th whelp) - this might be a way in obtaining one just as circling around Tanaris hoping to get one.<br /><br />I got mine the other way, direct spawn in Tanaris. Despite the map saying the best chance is around Gadzetan, I never got any out there - and that includes secondary spawns as well. In my experience best way to get them is near CoT entrance, middle of the Desert (incl. Dunemaul Compound) and the most spawns I got were at southern part of the desert - between ruins and around giant fossils with Rocs (where I also got my rare Kitten after approx. 6-8hrs).<br /><br />Getting any is easy, getting a rare is a challenge - best of luck hunters.<br /><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/GuXaU_d6YKM" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/GuXaU_d6YKM</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Birkelirk</b></h3>Found as secondary pet in 3. try outside Gadgetzan</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jkpman</b></h3>I'm not the most patient guy which is a bad thing for an achievement hunter/pet farmer, I didn't get anything after around an hour of farming the infinite whelps outside the caverns of time. So I few back to Gadgetzan figuring I'd log out for a bit and try again later, throwing the dice one more time I fought a sea gul, and luckily the sand kitten was a 2nd pet.<br /><br />I suppose the moral of the story is keep trying and eventually you'll be a crazy cat man/lady like me :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xyzetta</b></h3>Got mine as a spawn between Gadgetzan and Caverns of Time.<br />I first had a couple of tries at other pets to see if it would spawn as a second pet. But no luck.<br />So I was very surprised and happy when I found it wandering around on its own. And it was the last I needed for the &quot;Crazy Cat Lady/Man&quot; achievement!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>logiboy123</b></h3>Got one today @ 36, 76 in Tanaris. It was the secondary pet with a Stinkbug.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DeusExMchna</b></h3>I got mine today near Gadgetzan! I got incredibly lucky and got it on my 8th try,just one more cat and I have the title!</div>
