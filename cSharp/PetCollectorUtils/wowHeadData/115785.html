<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>OCDCatLady</b></h3>I did this quest on my main. The matriarch spawned slowly and killing her completed the quest.<br /><br />I went to where the little thing was supposed to be. It wasn't there.<br /><br />I waited. And I waited. And I waited some more.<br /><br />Then I said unkind things about the hatchling's parentage and went back to Dalaran.<br /><br />I came back later on an alt.<br /><br />This time, I killed the matriarch early and immediately ran to where the little thing was supposed to be. It wasn't there.<br /><br />Then I took a few steps to the side to look somewhere else, and that put me back into the &quot;zone&quot; for the as-yet-uncompleted world quest.<br /><br />The hatchling immediately appeared. I was easily able to jump down to it...only to realize I had all the food on my main and not on my alt. Go me. Thank you random player who gave me some.<br /><br />So...yeah. If you aren't seeing it, try looking before you finish the quest and make sure you are in the range of the WQ.</div>

I am hoping to clarify somethings just in case other people were confused/concerned. <br /><br />My second kill of the Matriarch (hatchling did not spawn after first kill) completed the world quest. The hatching still appeared for me and I was able to get it even after completing the world quest. So &quot;active&quot; just means live in the world, not active as in uncompleted on your map/log. <br /><br />After catching the hatchling, I headed back to where the matriarch spawns to see if she would come back. She did reappear about 10 or so minutes after I killed her. So, once again, it would seem &quot;active&quot; just means that it's live in the world and other people can do it, not that it has to be up on your map/uncompleted.<br /><br />So, it would appear that my running around avoiding to kill mobs and kiting like a mad woman to keep from finishing the quest was unwarranted. <br /><br />I guess it's possible that killing the matriarch after completing the quest might keep the hatchling from spawning but I'm not going to test it. At least not right now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Spencicle</b></h3>There are four things I did which caused this hatchling and the others to spawn. I killed the Matriarchs multiple times and the hatchlings did not spawn until I did these four things:<br /><br />1) Complete the World Quest<br />2) Kill the Matriarch's Nest<br />3) Be the first to tag the Matriarch<br />4) Kill the Matriarch</div>

Had Pangemt Vrykul Gamalost in my bag<br />3. Climbed up the hill and double jumped down to meet the Direbeak Hatchling.<br /> He was there.<br />4. Clicked on him, got into conversation, which stated for me to feed him<br />5. Clicked on this request and Direbeak Hatchling disappeared...<br /> Not in my bags and not in my Pets Collection.<br />Did I do something wrong or is it a bug ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JusticarCien</b></h3>For any of you who were good with alts in Warlords of Draenor, yet neglected your pet battling! I have exciting news for you!<br />Level 3 Garrisons will allow you to pick up <a href="/item=122457/ultimate-battle-training-stone">Ultimate Battle-Training Stone</a> from <a href="/npc=85418/lio-the-lioness">Lio the Lioness</a>, the quest you need to do is <a href="/quest=38241/unearthed-magic">Unearthed Magic</a>/<a href="/quest=38242/unearthed-magic">Unearthed Magic</a> and only involves you running to the entrance of your Garrison mine. Easy.<br /><br />Just make sure you start the quest for each hatchling on a level 110 character (I say this because my sneaky level 25 stone abuse alts were only 100), and log over to your alt, summon your desired hatchling, and right-click the stone directly on to the summoned baby raptor. Voila. You can complete the quest on the alt if you so desire for some XP.<br /><br />Edit: It may also be worth noting that you can bank your <a href="/item=122457/ultimate-battle-training-stone">Ultimate Battle-Training Stone</a> from <a href="/quest=39042/the-very-best">The Very Best</a> during the Pet Battle Week Holiday if you haven't caught all four hatchlings yet, and if you haven't got stones left from your Garrisons.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Weasei</b></h3>As of Patch 7.1 there are 4 new Falcosaur pets. Each of the pets is associated with a different world quest around the Broken Isles. These pets all provide a quest chain to obtain a different mount. These quest chains require a couple of weeks to complete as each subsequent quest becomes available from your summoned pet after the daily reset after completing the previous quest.<br /><br />To get each pet, you must first kill the Matriarch in the world quest area, which will cause the NPC version of the pet to spawn. The next step is to go to the NPC and interact with it and feed it its favourite food. If you don't have the food, you won't obtain the pet. There are vendors selling the required foods at the closest flightpaths to each world quest for most of these so just remember to pick some up on your way there!<br /><br />Important note on orphans: I've encountered issues with the orphans not spawning after killing the matriarch. This isn't affected by the matriarch's nest but it does seem to be affected by getting the last hit on the matriarch. If you can't see the orphan after killing the matriarch then you may need to wait for the respawn. To check if you have completed the requirements to see the orphan run the scripts below.<br /><br /><b><a href="/npc=115784/snowfeather-hatchling">Snowfeather Hatchling</a></b> - <a href="/quest=44892/snowfeather-swarm">Snowfeather Swarm!</a><br />This pet can be picked up from <a href="/npc=115737/orphaned-snowfeather">Orphaned Snowfeather</a> in Highmountain (/way Highmountain 32.5, 28.2) after killing the <a href="/npc=115673/snowfeather-matriarch">Snowfeather Matriarch</a> (/way Highmountain 35.1, 21.9).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>elrenno</b></h3>The last set of daily quests for each hatchling are especially tough. They require you to use your pet plus two of a specific type of pet (i.e. the snowfeather hatchling and two undead battlepets). I found the easiest world quests to finish were the ones in Dalaran and the felspider one in Aszuna. <br /><br />For best results, use the pet training stones you get from the dungeon/raid quests to level up some pets in each type with different abilities than what you already have so you have some variety. You will need it with the world quests.<br /><br />Note: Blizz has hotfixed the ability to do the same pet battle on multiple toons for multiple credit. But, as far as I can tell, you can still do multiple daily quests if you have more than one toon at 110.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Khilante</b></h3>Unfortunately as of today, 18 July 2017, you can no longer swap toons to get the mount faster.<br /><br />Was able to swap toons yesterday, but unable to do it after the update today.<br /><br />Edit: *cough* Was able to do it again today (19 July)... this is so odd...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Fetkosh</b></h3>Rule #1: Don't forgett to pull your hatchling out.<br />Rule #2: Don't forgett to pull your hatchling out!<br />Rule #3: Don't forgett to pull that stupid hatchling out!<br /><br />Awww... it despawned again! Lets see, where's another world quest...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vruko</b></h3>Just an FYI, Having the same color pet and mount out spawns a &quot;Heart&quot; emote between them....awwww</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jannerette</b></h3>I got my first orphaned Falcosaur yesterday. After completing the WQ I hung around until the the orphan spawned. The Matriarch was killed 4 times but it was not until her NEST spawned and was destroyed that the orphan spawned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bansy</b></h3>If you're doing this like me and doing 1 quest every day for your hatchlings, i'm about to make your life alot easyer!<br /><br />You can do them all in 1 day if you summon them on different characters after every quest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aedna</b></h3>If these pets won't give you their quests once you've acquired them, you probably haven't learned pet battling. This can be learned from the pet battle trainer in Stormwind or Orgrimmar. I didn't get the quest for weeks, opened a ticket and this is what a gamemaster told me to do. Upon learning pet battling, I had to relog, and once I logged in they offered me the quest!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Anieu</b></h3>While it's a bit of a pain to get, every pet battler should have one of these. The versatility of this bird simply cannot be overstated. Everyone should have, or work on getting a Direbeak.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>koscik</b></h3>It appears that currently you have to invoke the script like this:<br /><br />/script print(C_QuestLog.IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(44880))</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1455595</b></h3>The direhatch is a falcosaur in old thinking the dinosaur</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>greencatspryte</b></h3>Worth looking for the hatchling before running around killing the matriarch, I've found 2 hatchlings now without having to fight - someone had probably got the matriarch before - otherwise great directions on foods needed and locations from other contributors, thanks all</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ye7i</b></h3>I have been able to complete multiple dailies for each hatchling during the same day by using alt characters. At first, I thought this method required an alt from another faction, but it doesn't seem to matter as I did more testing.<br /><br />Important Note: Accept and complete the dailies on one character first, then move to an alt and summon the hatchlings again to get the next set of dailies during the same day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gardenbearz</b></h3>It would be a good idea to make a macro to target the orphaned direbeak as it can spawn quite a ways away from the matriarch and it is super tiny.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>favebook</b></h3>If you are using <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=122457/ultimate-battle-training-stone">Ultimate Battle-Training Stone</a> on your pets while the quest is active, it may not auto-complete. Relogging/reloading, dismissing the pet or changing to an alt may not auto-complete either. Resolution is to abandon the quest and take it again - it will auto-complete instantly.</div>
