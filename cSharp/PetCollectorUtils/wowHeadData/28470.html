One of its many variable stat types (\"Natures\" to coin a phrase) is a heavy Power build: 149\/14\/10 at level 1. That stat build's low Speed is offset by the Flying Passive (increases Speed by 50% while it remains above 50% HP). Also, since the pet is only 40g (assuming you have Exalted), you can just buy several of them until you get the stat setup that you like and cage and sell the rest.\n\nAdditionally, the Nether Ray Fry's moveset is pretty amazing. It has excellent 'type coverage'. All six of its abilities are what I'd call \"basic attacks\" (they have no real secondary effects and no cooldowns), but they are ALL different types: one Magic, one Beast, one Elemental, one Undead, one Flying, and one Dragonkin. This makes it extremely valuable when facing many different Pet Tamers, since you know their lineup in advance (or at least you do if you look it up or try to fight them and forfeit\/fail) and can swap in the moves for the Nether Ray Fry that you need.\n\nThe only real issue with the Nether Ray Fry is that he isn't a team player. His moves have little or no synergy with the rest of the team, so you may not want him a pure level 25 \"optimal\" setup. However, I still think the Nether Ray Fry is awesome for leveling and defeating pre-Pandaria pet tamers.\n\nPowerful, Versatile, and most importantly, Cute.\n\nP.S.

Mine is Breed #4 (pure attack) and I wouldn't have it any other way, given that its flying type means it will start the battle with an artificially boosted speed.\r\n\r\nThat out of the way, what do you think of when I say â€œStarmieâ€?  â€œWTFâ€ and â€œA Pokemon!â€ are probably pretty common answers, but those of us blessed and cursed to know Pokemon shudder in fear.\r\n\r\nStarmie is a very strong, competitive Pokemon not because it has a devastating trick, but because itâ€™s all-around good with one extra factor adding in: You never really know what moves a Starmie is going to have.  It learns water and psychic moves, for the most part, and can take some dangerous TMs and HMs, but any particular Starmie might also have normal attacks, or even a thunder and\/or rock move, coming completely out of the blue to surprise you with type matching.\r\n\r\nNether Ray Fry (And itâ€™s captured mirror, the Fledgling Nether Ray) look to me to be the Starmie of Pet Battles due to their very eclectic move set.\r\n\r\nFor leveling, they start out with the godsend that is Bite, dealing better damage to the critters you run into every two steps.  Immediatley thereafter they get a Dragonkin attack, followed by Undead.  Their second layer of moves give them Magic, Flying, and Elemental.  All of these moves are pure damage-dealers, but some are a little more clever, leading towards varied setups, or being able to build FTW with intelligence\r\n\r\nBite and Arcane Blast are â€œSpamâ€ moves â€“ arcane blast wants to be spammed, while Bite is simple, reliable Beast damage.  For leveling, I like to keep Bite, but for PvP Pet Battles, Arcane Blast helps it cut through the hit points of other flyers, the only things liable to be faster than it.\r\n\r\nThe third tier of moves (Shadow Shock\/Lash.  Iâ€™m doing this out of order for a reason) present different options.  Overall, I prefer Lash, as when the Fry goes first, itâ€™s very deadly.  Shadow Shock might have a place though, if you can accurately predict youâ€™ll be facing the troublesome humanoid species (very rare in the wild)\r\n\r\nThe second tier of moves, Tail Sweep and Slicing Wind, are both recovery, presenting a high damage option when youâ€™ve dropped below 50% and are now going second, keeping the Fry from being dead in the water with half its health left.  Of these, Tail Sweep is more reliable damage, while Slicing Wind has a higher potential.  Neither is weak on a common type, but Slicing Wind is strong against Aquatic, while Tail Sweep afflicts the much less common magicals.  Still, in PvP where youâ€™re liable to see a lot of Dragonkin and not as many aquatics (compared to PvE at least), consider Tail Sweep.\r\n\r\nIn addition to not being able to predict a Fryâ€™s build going in, your opponent may also have a hard time predicting your move from round to round, as none of the fryâ€™s abilities have cooldowns.  This isn't quite so important, since none of the fry's moves do anything other than damage, but I still thought it worth noting.","date":"2013-04-25T16:44:58-05:00","rating":29,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":5,"id":1872140,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Whiterock","body":"Firefly, Wasp and Nether Ray family:[pre][small]Firefly Group1 abilities:                                  Firefly Group2 abilities:\n[petability=119]        [petability=632]  [petability=706]            [del][petability=119][\/del]        [petability=270]    [petability=632]\n[petability=420]   [petability=506]    [petability=270]    [del][petability=420][\/del]   [petability=359]            [petability=366]\n\n[npc=97511] and [npc=88355] abilities:                 [npc=88359] abilities:\n[petability=1369] [petability=922]   [petability=170]         [del][petability=1369][\/del] [petability=170]         [petability=515]\n[petability=504]   [petability=1050]   [petability=312]            [del][petability=504][\/del]   [del][petability=1050][\/del]   [petability=1040]\n\n[npc=51632] abilities:\n[petability=113]           [petability=178]         [petability=706]\n[petability=504]   [petability=155]             [petability=162][hr]\n\nWasp abilities:                                            [npc=85014] abilities:\n[petability=1369] [petability=426]            [petability=1050]   [del][petability=1369][\/del] [del][petability=426][\/del]            [del][petability=1050][\/del]\n[petability=110]           [petability=518] [petability=802]           [petability=429]           [del][petability=518][\/del] [del][petability=802][\/del][hr]\n\nNether Ray abilities:                                      [npc=88452] abilities:\n[petability=110]           [petability=122]       [petability=422]     [del][petability=110][\/del]           [petability=1223]    [petability=122]\n[petability=421]   [petability=420]     [petability=394]             [del][petability=421][\/del]   [petability=504]     [petability=422][\/small][\/pre][pre]                                Base stats at rare 25 level: 1400 260 260\nName\\Breed:          H\/H P\/P S\/S H\/P P\/S H\/S H\/B P\/B S\/B B\/B HiPo PWR SPD\n[npc=21076]                       [ins]@[\/ins]           [del]+[\/del]   [del]+[\/del]           [del]+[\/del]   -81     +16\n[npc=63850]                      +   +   +       +   -81 +16\n[npc=65185]                           +   +   +       +   -81 +16\n[npc=65216]                    [Ins]+[\/ins]   +   [Ins]+[\/ins]   +   +       [del]*[\/del]   +\n\n[npc=67329]                          +   +   +       +       -16 +16\n[npc=88356]                          +   +   +       +       -16 +16\n[npc=88357]                            +   +   +       +       -16 +16\n\n[npc=97511]                    [Ins]+[\/ins]   +   +   +   [Ins]+[\/ins]   +       -16 +16\n[npc=88355]                                  +   +   +       +       -16 +16\n[npc=88359]                      +   +   +       +       -16 +16\n[npc=51632]                                             [ins]@[\/ins]       -16 +16[hr]\n[npc=85257]                                +   +   +   +\n[npc=85255]                               +   +   +   +\n[npc=85253]                                 +   +   +   +\n[npc=85254]                                     +   +   +   +\n[npc=85014]                                     +   +   +   +[hr]\n\n[npc=62627]                              [ins]@[\/ins]          -162 +33\n[npc=28470]            [Ins]+[\/ins]   [Ins]+[\/ins]       [Ins]+[\/ins]                   +   -81 +16\n[npc=88452]                                           [ins]@[\/ins]          -162 +33\n\n[small][ins]@[\/ins] - mandatory, [Ins]+[\/ins] - recommended, [del]+[\/del] - removed.

One of its many variable stat types (&quot;Natures&quot; to coin a phrase) is a heavy Power build: 149/14/10 at level 1. That stat build's low Speed is offset by the Flying Passive (increases Speed by 50% while it remains above 50% HP). Also, since the pet is only 40g (assuming you have Exalted), you can just buy several of them until you get the stat setup that you like and cage and sell the rest.<br /><br />Additionally, the Nether Ray Fry's moveset is pretty amazing. It has excellent 'type coverage'. All six of its abilities are what I'd call &quot;basic attacks&quot; (they have no real secondary effects and no cooldowns), but they are ALL different types: one Magic, one Beast, one Elemental, one Undead, one Flying, and one Dragonkin. This makes it extremely valuable when facing many different Pet Tamers, since you know their lineup in advance (or at least you do if you look it up or try to fight them and forfeit/fail) and can swap in the moves for the Nether Ray Fry that you need.<br /><br />The only real issue with the Nether Ray Fry is that he isn't a team player. His moves have little or no synergy with the rest of the team, so you may not want him a pure level 25 &quot;optimal&quot; setup. However, I still think the Nether Ray Fry is awesome for leveling and defeating pre-Pandaria pet tamers.<br /><br />Powerful, Versatile, and most importantly, Cute.<br /><br />P.S. Look into the <a href="/npc=62627/fledgling-nether-ray">Fledgling Nether Ray</a> for an alternative color scheme (red instead of blue)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1015467</b></h3>Indeed a very strong, versatile pet. Goes great in my team, glad to have the little guy</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TevishSzat</b></h3>It's just a little bit cruel that these guys have multiple breeds: most pets that come from items do not. Mine is Breed #4 (pure attack) and I wouldn't have it any other way, given that its flying type means it will start the battle with an artificially boosted speed.<br /><br />That out of the way, what do you think of when I say â€œStarmieâ€? â€œWTFâ€ and â€œA Pokemon!â€ are probably pretty common answers, but those of us blessed and cursed to know Pokemon shudder in fear.<br /><br />Starmie is a very strong, competitive Pokemon not because it has a devastating trick, but because itâ€™s all-around good with one extra factor adding in: You never really know what moves a Starmie is going to have. It learns water and psychic moves, for the most part, and can take some dangerous TMs and HMs, but any particular Starmie might also have normal attacks, or even a thunder and/or rock move, coming completely out of the blue to surprise you with type matching.<br /><br />Nether Ray Fry (And itâ€™s captured mirror, the Fledgling Nether Ray) look to me to be the Starmie of Pet Battles due to their very eclectic move set.<br /><br />For leveling, they start out with the godsend that is Bite, dealing better damage to the critters you run into every two steps. Immediatley thereafter they get a Dragonkin attack, followed by Undead. Their second layer of moves give them Magic, Flying, and Elemental. All of these moves are pure damage-dealers, but some are a little more clever, leading towards varied setups, or being able to build FTW with intelligence<br /><br />Bite and Arcane Blast are â€œSpamâ€ moves â€“ arcane blast wants to be spammed, while Bite is simple, reliable Beast damage. For leveling, I like to keep Bite, but for PvP Pet Battles, Arcane Blast helps it cut through the hit points of other flyers, the only things liable to be faster than it.<br /><br />The third tier of moves (Shadow Shock/Lash. Iâ€™m doing this out of order for a reason) present different options. Overall, I prefer Lash, as when the Fry goes first, itâ€™s very deadly. Shadow Shock might have a place though, if you can accurately predict youâ€™ll be facing the troublesome humanoid species (very rare in the wild)<br /><br />The second tier of moves, Tail Sweep and Slicing Wind, are both recovery, presenting a high damage option when youâ€™ve dropped below 50% and are now going second, keeping the Fry from being dead in the water with half its health left. Of these, Tail Sweep is more reliable damage, while Slicing Wind has a higher potential. Neither is weak on a common type, but Slicing Wind is strong against Aquatic, while Tail Sweep afflicts the much less common magicals. Still, in PvP where youâ€™re liable to see a lot of Dragonkin and not as many aquatics (compared to PvE at least), consider Tail Sweep.<br /><br />In addition to not being able to predict a Fryâ€™s build going in, your opponent may also have a hard time predicting your move from round to round, as none of the fryâ€™s abilities have cooldowns. This isn't quite so important, since none of the fry's moves do anything other than damage, but I still thought it worth noting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dlbert2000</b></h3>Went with P/P, dont regret it.<br />He has moves from 6 different pet types (all 6 are different)<br />Hes a flyer so +50% speed so he gets the first hit (unless VS another flyer)<br />When he gets below 50% and becomes slower than the enemy, Tail sweep hits like a truck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ZsadistNazjatar</b></h3>If you buy it, it has immediatly rare quality.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>327600</b></h3>You CAN keep buying these to get the breed that you want. The price is 28g with the guild lvl24 bonus Bartering.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Yechnagoth</b></h3>You should be able to get those as caged pets without needing the rep, like Tiny sporebat and Tiny goldfish.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aliandrin</b></h3>I like the 12/12 power/speed breed. It still grows up to have a good attack (309 is no 341 but still), and 289 speed is nothing to sneeze at. This one can keep using Lash until its very last breath. I'm going to raise one each of the power, speed/power, and speed breeds.<br /><br />You can only have three in your pokedex, and it's got four breeds, but that's fine, since the #3 balance breed really isn't worth investing in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xexji</b></h3>Even the B/B breed (with 1400 health) is still really really good. Pick this guy up (preferably with a better breed than mine, since I leveled him before I cared about breeds) and use him. Incredibly useful and versatile.</div>
