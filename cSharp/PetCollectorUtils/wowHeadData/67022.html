I arrived a few minutes to 9pm server time only to find no Festival. I checked back every hour, and the Festival started at midnight. A few things (and other comments on this page have definitely helped):\r\n\r\n1. As Luxbot mentioned, the Festival is affected by the 5.1 time changes. All activities, including this one, are based on PST, so that means the Festival starts at 9pm PST and ends at 12am PST on all servers (save Oceanic).\r\n2. SylviaDragon's steps were -incredibly- helpful. Make a targetting macro. As a note, I used \/tar Wanderer's Festival Hatch. I originally was simply using \/tar Wanderer, but the lanterns that spawn in the water are named Wanderer's Festival Lantern, so they were picked up by the macro. Binding a key to interact with target (through the actual menu, not through a macro) is what enabled me to get into battle with a hatchling before I closed the full distance.\r\n3. The hatchling I fought was 25 (though others mention they are 23), so come prepared with enough high level pets. They are aquatic, so they're weak against flying pets. Only 3 spawned at the start, right after the fireworks.\r\n\r\nI won't be up to see if anymore spawn at the closing ceremony and fireworks though. =( Best of luck to everyone!

I had forgotten that I had logged out in the wrong place from a previous rare spawn spot (waves fist at Jaguero Island and lack of rain) and I had my main team in place.  When I got to the festival it had already started and there were already tamers out there at spawn spots, so I'd missed the initial spawns.  Or so I thought.  I found a Wanderer north of the statue that had been missed.\r\n\r\nI made the mistake of using my Qiraji Guardling's (Rare level 25) opening move of Sandstorm (strong attack against the Wanderer) against the poor quality spawn and 1 shot it when it crit.  Needless to say I was rather unhappy about that.  I wasn't sure if they would respawn during the ceremony.

The other tamers had left, presumably thinking that was it for another week, while I stayed and prayed, and *pop* another turned up.  \r\n\r\nThis one was common quality and had higher health, which was lucky since the Qiraji's Sandstorm crit again leaving 100 health left.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Feliciamarie</b></h3><u>Alright, just for some extra clarification about this pet that I couldn't find here.</u><br /><br />The turtle spawns at 9:00pm PST time <b>AND</b> 11:00pm<b> PST</b> time.<br /><br />If you don't manage to nab one of the few that spawn at 9:00pm,<b> wait around or come back at 11:00pm and another set spawn.</b><br /><br />No more respawn in between. If you manage to find one between 9:00pm-11:00pm, then no one tried battling them and you got lucky.<br /><br />Once you hear the fireworks go off, look around, they should spawn within 10-15 seconds.<br /><br />When I went, three turtles spawned the first time around. I didn't manage to get one. However, I stuck around and at 11:00pm four more spawned and were taken VERY quickly but I waited away from the center and managed to get one off to the side.<br /><br /><i>PST- 9PM / 11PM<br />MST - 10PM / 12AM<br />CST - 11PM / 1AM<br />EST - 12AM / 2AM</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ashendise</b></h3>These spawn during the Wanderer's Festival on Turtle Beach just East of the Incursion around 71, 33 (not where the marker is on the map above). You will see many candles appear in the water and wandering celebrants stroll up the beach. Chen Stormstout brings his keg and Lorewalker Cho sings his ceremonial song. Event occurs between at 9 pm and 11 pm server time and grants Wanderers, Dreamers, and You. (10 pts).<br /><br />After the fireworks go off, three spawn right on the same beach. They're level 24, same as the other fight-able critters around the area. <br /><br />The festival lasts about 23 minutes before closing, so don't come here between 9:24pm and 10:59pm expecting a pet battle right away.<br /><br />Note: When in battle you are NOT phased to everyone else in the area. Getting hit by the opposing faction does interrupt the battle, thus losing your chance. (Bring friends!)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ElliotHunts</b></h3>I was quite amazed at how quickly all the green paws were snapped up. <br /><br />I managed to snag one by spamming my /tar Wanderer's Festival Hatchling macro and spamming my ''interact with target'' button which I've bound to middle mouse button.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>10172</b></h3>He is level 23.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SylviaDragon</b></h3>I was the first one to snag one this Sunday. It was my first time camping it and I caught one automatically as soon as they came up. The event is bugged due to daylight savings time so it started at 10pm instead of 9. So if nothing happens at 9 this may be why. Here are some tips for catching one on a crowed server.<br /><br />Step one: Make a /tar Wanderer's Festival Hatchling macro and put it on a hotkey.<br />Step two: put your interact with target command on a hot key<br />Step three: stand at about 71, 33 as was previously posted.<br />Now spam your two hotkeys =)<br />step four: profit?<br /><br />Only one spawned at these coordinates and the other two spawned nearby. Possibly just out of range of the macro. I recommend staying mounted so you can get to them faster incase they spawn out of range. (possibly use a big mount like a proto drake so its wings can shield the pet against your competitors? ) just try not to fly around since you need to be grounded to start the fight and if you fumble you can miss him.) they spawned about 3-5 minutes after the top of the hour, just seconds after the fireworks went off. <br /><br />IMPORTANT:<br />The location on the map is WRONG as of 11/4/12! They spawn farther down the map. You will know you are in the right place because there is a big dragon turtle statue there. <br />The one I got was of a poor quality. They are not guaranteed to be rare and you probably canâ€™t cherry pick them. By the time you finish you first battle the others will most likely be gone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Konstapeln</b></h3>I must be one very lucky companion hunter. I found and caught one of these on a Tuesday evening. Sure, he/she is of common quality but considering that I found him at all such a long time after the festival it's quality doesn't bother me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Donnicton</b></h3>On my server, there was no less than five of these turtles that spawned when the event started at 9 PM this previous Sunday. Fortunately, my server doesn't appear to really care about pet battles, so any Pandaria spawns are pretty much free run thanks to no CRZ(hooray!). I'd say in a little less than a dozen people waiting on the achievement, only one other person battled the turtles there.<br /><br />Thanks to this I was able to capture three different turtles as an experiment, and I can confirm that the turtles in any given set <b>all have the same stats</b>.<br /><br />More specifically, every set of turtles will always have the same stat distribution, and same team quality as every other turtle that spawns at that specific time. I.e. if one is a green quality turtle(health-weighted) with a common moth and a poor quality seagull, all of the other spawns for that time are going to be green quality turtles(health-weighted), with a common moth and a poor quality seagull.<br /><br />So you don't need to worry about feeling like you missed out if other people grabbed other turtles and you only got one of questionable quality - everyone else got the same turtle you did. If you want to try for a better quality turtle, your best(only) bet is to just come back at a later date/time and grab one from another set.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wulfrick</b></h3>Confirmed Nov 18, 2012:<br />Turtles appeared at 9:00pm server, I showed up at 9:04pm and they were already gone (probably 10 people there). Came back a little before 11:00pm and 5 more appeared fairly spread out around the beach (like the &quot;5&quot; side of a die - one near each corner and one near the center) following the fireworks of a second opening ceremony. Got lucky and snagged one this time (now the Qiraji Guardling is the only capturable pet I don't have! \o/).<br /><br />Note: Most of the time clicking on a wild pet while mounted will dismount me and enter the pet battle, but once in a great while I'll get a &quot; Must be standing...&quot; error because I'm mounted. I'm not sure if it's the particular terrain or pet or what, but if anyone else has experienced this error as well, please note that I got it on this pet as well, dangerously delaying snagging the hatchling, so be warned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>701896</b></h3>As of 5.1 patch it looks like they have changed spawn times. It used to be 9pm and 11pm EST... now it looks like they have altered it to coincide with pacific time. Thus they weren't there this Sunday when I went at 11pm, but were there instead at midnight. Assuming the logic is that they altered it for pacific time, I assume they would've been there again at 2am for the close. Hopefully someone else can confirm this as I was unable to stay up that late. <br /><br />Hope this info about the change in spawn times helps</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nolapete</b></h3>Confirmed that the new time is based on PST instead of server time. This is a horrible inconvenience for those not in PST.<br /><br />Last night I was able to upgrade my hatchling to uncommon with one shot at capturing 11 CST. I had previously only captured a poor. Best advice is to have a macro to target and set focus on wanderer's festival hatchling and have the interact with target hot keyed. Spam your macro and hit your hotkey.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>luxbot</b></h3>As of Patch 5.1, Blizzard has moved all activities <u>from server time to Pacific time</u>. So dailies reset at 6am Eastern instead of 3am Eastern, and this event occurs at 12am midnight between Sunday and Monday morning. So get there before 11:59pm Sunday night.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Starchy</b></h3>With no raid scheduled for tonight (first Sunday in awhile!), I idled in pet battles until it was time for the Festival on my server. I arrived a few minutes to 9pm server time only to find no Festival. I checked back every hour, and the Festival started at midnight. A few things (and other comments on this page have definitely helped):<br /><br />1. As Luxbot mentioned, the Festival is affected by the 5.1 time changes. All activities, including this one, are based on PST, so that means the Festival starts at 9pm PST and ends at 12am PST on all servers (save Oceanic).<br />2. SylviaDragon's steps were -incredibly- helpful. Make a targetting macro. As a note, I used /tar Wanderer's Festival Hatch. I originally was simply using /tar Wanderer, but the lanterns that spawn in the water are named Wanderer's Festival Lantern, so they were picked up by the macro. Binding a key to interact with target (through the actual menu, not through a macro) is what enabled me to get into battle with a hatchling before I closed the full distance.<br />3. The hatchling I fought was 25 (though others mention they are 23), so come prepared with enough high level pets. They are aquatic, so they're weak against flying pets. Only 3 spawned at the start, right after the fireworks.<br /><br />I won't be up to see if anymore spawn at the closing ceremony and fireworks though. =( Best of luck to everyone! Also, the Festival itself is pretty awesome. I love the lore, the music, the setting, the npcs, the whole setup!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PocketFox</b></h3>I cannot express how useful -- almost necessary -- it is to have a /target macro and have an interact-with-target hotkey bound. Sit on a known spawn point and start spamming those; I was in battle with mine before it had even rendered on my screen. There was someone next to me also camping the hatchlings, and he told me he never even saw a paw on his minimap, so I'd managed to tag before anybody (even me) knew it was there.<br /><br />Seriously, set up a very simple &quot;/tar Wanderer's Festival Hatchling&quot; macro, set it to a hotkey, and bind Interact with Target to another key, and just spam.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>555424</b></h3>Just thought i would mention this, If you bind the taget macro to say... your Up scroll wheel<br />and the interact macro to the Down scroll wheel you will beat anyone in the area with these two macros bound to 2 different keyboard keys</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PoelleDC</b></h3>Does anybody know the new times for this pet?<br />A gamemaster said to me: With patch 5.1 the spawntime was changed, but i have to find out the new time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1069318</b></h3>I am on a medium population server and there were about 30 people there at midnight. Of the 3 spawns I saw I had 0 chance of getting to one because the beach was so packed. I'd probably have better luck at 3am but as Sunday is a work night doing so is impracticable. Looks like I have a slim chance of getting this pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>blkdeath75</b></h3>I don't see much for CST so:<br /><br />Central Standard Time POST 5.1 patch is 11 pm Sunday evening through 2 am Monday morning<br /><br />This was on US-Malfurion and was my server and local time.<br /><br />I was there for the opening and stood off to the side <br /><br />1.Make a macro-- /tar Wanderer's Festival Hatchling<br /><br />2.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Eillesthis</b></h3>To be perfectly clear...<br /><br />This little guy only spawns during the opening and closing ceremonies of the Wanderer's Festival, and on North American servers those ceremonies begin at <b>9PM and 11PM PST</b> (Pacific Standard Time, GMT-8). Figure out when that is where you live.<br /><br />The time on your server no longer matters, thanks to: <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7200062357#1" rel="nofollow"> Patch 5.1: Realm Event Time Changes</a>. The time where you live never mattered. That last comment you read - the time where the person who posted that lives really never mattered. That person telling us the event &quot;started at midnight&quot; doesn't help us because we don't know if he means game or real time, and we don't know what server he's on or where he lives. Perhaps some people aren't aware that different servers are in different time zones, so they think everyone's game clock is on EST.<br /><br />We shall see in March if Blizzard changes it with Daylight Saving Time, or if it stays the same for the computers and thus is an hour later for most of us people (I see you, Arizona and Hawaii).<br /><br />As for the location, for those of you who are more visual, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/maps?data=6134:721316">see this map</a>.<br /><br />EDIT: Daylight Saving Time is finally here, and the real time of the event has not changed, but for most of us the time on our clocks has. The ceremonies begin at <b>10PM and 12AM <u>PDT</u></b> (Pacific Daylight Time, GMT-7). This equates to 11PM and 1AM MDT, 12AM and 2AM CDT, 1AM and 3AM EDT.<br /><br />EDIT: Per <a href="/object=223184/wanderers-festival-announcement">Wanderer's Festival Announcement</a>, talk to <a href="/npc=73594/wandering-herald">Wandering Herald</a> Sunday evening and he will tell you how long you have until it starts.</div>

It is based off of PST (5.1 event changes).<br /><br /><ul><li>Eastern - Midnight and 2 am</li><li>Central - 11 pm and 1 am </li><li>Mountain - 10 pm and Midnight</li><li>Pacific - 9 pm and 11 pm</li></ul><br /><br />Update: Daylight savings does not seem to effect these times.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>hootstwo</b></h3>Just to reiterate what everyone else here has already said, the macros are an absolute necessity. I was spamming my macro the whole time (along with my interact with target key), but watching the minimap simultaneously. At no point in time did a single green paw show on the map. I got a turtle, so did a guildmate and I have no idea how many others may have been captured (there were about 20 people all vying for the pet), but not ONE was displayed on the minimap (or the actual screen other than my own).<br /><br />Just to be perfectly clear, if you're hoping to just get &quot;lucky&quot; and get this pet without a macro, you'll either be waiting a long time, or you'll want to be on a totally dead server and trying at the closing of the ceremony.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>m4zurka</b></h3>At exactly midnight Sunday night (Monday morning) realm time on the Shattered Hand server (9:00pm PST), a bunch of lanterns appeared in the water off Turtle Beach. Within a minute or so, friendly NPCs started spawning all over the beach (Wandering Pilgrims, Wandering Celebrants, etc). At about 12:02 the fireworks went off, followed shortly by maybe 1/2 a dozen hatchlings spawning on the beach. There were a few other people waiting for the spawn, but I was able to capture an uncommon and enter into a second battle with another uncommon. This seems to support the theory that the turtles spawning together all have the same stats, I guess making me kind of a jerk for trying for more than one :\. By 12:30 the NPCs and lanterns disappeared, and I had not seen any more spawn than the initial few. I decided to be content with my uncommon for now and not stick around for the anticipated 2:00am spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zysis</b></h3>A little 'trick' for you pet battlers out there... If you happen to find a blue pet and accidentally kill it, you CAN queue for a battleground or dungeon while in the pet battle, then leave immediately and will find the pet still there and still having the blue in the team! I've had quite a few incidents where I've accidentally killed the blue and found this to be a great solution for not losing that one rare tame.<br /><br /> You can also use this same method to reserve a pet for a friend, by entering battle and doing nothing, waiting for the friend to get there, then queue a battleground and voila, they can proceed to tame that pet you saved for them!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Daherado</b></h3>So many posts here on how to get the pet but nothing on how the pet is in battles.<br />This turtle comes in 3 breeds, they are a Balance (B/B) Double health (H/H) and health/speed (H/S), this is what the stats look like at lvl 25;<br /><br />B/B 1644 HP 260 Pwr 260 Spd<br />H/H 1888 HP 244 Pwr 244 Spd<br />H/S 1709 HP 244 Pwr 273 Spd<br /><br />The balance one is average, have a slightly below average power and speed but slightly higher health, the health one compensates slightly on power and speed with a huge 1888 health and the H/S being a bit faster than the other 2 but with still a decent amount of health.<br /><br />When using his Perk up ability, the H/H one climbs to a massive 2013 health, and increasing your other pets health too, a valuable ability when coming up against a hard hitting tamer.<br />Pump and grasp are handy for those elemantal Spirit tamers too.<br /><br />Overall a pretty good pet, and the huge health pool + Bite makes it easy to level when battling multiple critters, being able to solo a whole trio of them =D</div>

The Wanderer's Festival takes place in *Turtle Cove* itself, at coordinates 72, 32. The current pin at 78, 28 is actually *Krasarang Cove* -- a contested area of Horde vs. Alliance.<br /><br />Just look for a large statue on the beach depicting a pandaren on the back of a turtle and you're in the right place. It will even have a readable scroll at the base you can click on for an achievement.<br /><br />The festival typically occurs at 9pm *Pacific Time*. But there are issues with Daylight Savings time so depending on the season, it may be an hour late.<br /><br />Note: On Sunday at 11pm, confirmed spawn on the Moon Guard Server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Teevo</b></h3>Got mine this past Sunday night. These spawn at 9pm PACIFIC time, not server time.. as I went there at 9pm Eastern, 10pm Eastern, and 11pm Eastern with nothing happening. At midnight Eastern time the festival began and the hatchlings spawned after the fireworks.<br /><br />First round @ 9pm pst 7 hatchlings spawned. I tried two of them, both were white (common). Second round @ 11pm pst 5 hatchlings spawned. Myself and the two other people both got rares. I have read that each round of hatchlings will all be the same... aka if 8 spawn and one is rare, they will all be rare. From my one night of experience, this could very well be true.. but I wont put it in stone unless I did more research, heh.<br /><br />Nevertheless, extremely excited to have this awesome pet in rare quality. The festival was very cool too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LSavage</b></h3>As others have already observed, this pet spawns as a set of 3-5, twice a week, just after 21:00 and 23:00 on Sundays.<br /><br />This means that only 6-10 players a week can get this per realm, making it a highly contested prize.<br /><br />I have a theory, however, that it is possible to get more to spawn by always leaving one of them up (assuming one could get actually get sufficient co-operation on your server to co-ordinate this).<br /><br />I say this because it is a well observed fact that when some of the pets in a pack are removed, as long as at least one remains, the pack refills fairly quickly - around 5-7 minutes. (For example this is confirmed to happen in the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63838#comments">Gilded Moths discussion</a>).<br /><br />The difficulty in testing this theory is that, because this little guy is <b>so</b> rare, there won't ever be any left after the event. Once the last one is picked off the pack is gone until the next event.<br /><br />That being said, I have a possible idea to test this theory, and possibly set up a farming opportunity for a group of people all wanting this pet:<br /><br /><ul><li>Get a group of you who all want the pet.</li><li>One of you tag the pet, but don't engage it.</li><li>Wait until the crowd of people clamouring to try and capture the pets has dispersed</li><li>The person who tagged the pet queues for a random scenario, and enters it as soon as it pops up (as of 5.2 you will be able to just leave the pet battle)</li><li>This should then allow the pet to respawn</li><li>Hopefully this critter will now be able to stay alive long enough to see if it respawns its buddies to fill the set again</li></ul><br /><br />If this works, your group could then take turns &quot;farming&quot; the respawns, as long as you make sure to keep one alive.<br /><br />Alternatively, since respawns of this nature no longer have their stats tied to that of the original pack, you could conceivably farm for a rare (although I would personally recommend just using a battle stone to get your rare).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Uttermadnez</b></h3>As of 5.2, confirming that each of the Wanderer's Festival Hatchlings that spawn has it's own potential to be a rare with its own set of secondary battle companions.<br /><br />I captured a rare after peeking into the third spawn I came across in the set appearing around 10:02 pm PST.<br /><br />NOTE: With the March 2013 daylight savings change, the festival is now one hour later.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>direpath</b></h3>Pardon some repetition of information, I would like to add some more information as to what you will see as the festival starts. Just a note to those waiting around for the festival to start. Last night I was on the beach as the clock ticked over to 9:00pm PST. Here is what you will see:<br /><br /><ul><li>Within a minute, you will see floating lanterns start to appear in the water.</li><li>Next, Pandarens will start to appear/approach from random directions carrying supplies, some may have an umbrella and start dancing.</li><li>The supply-carrying ones will setup bonfires</li><li>This will happen over a few minutes. Once the fireworks go off, the hatchlings will spawn.</li></ul><br /><br />I received <a href="/achievement=7518/wanderers-dreamers-and-you">Wanderers, Dreamers, and You</a> prior to the hatchlings spawning by no more than a minute. If you do not have the achievement, this should be a good indicator to be ready to jump the spawn.<br /><br />Cho, Chen, and Li Li also appear, but I was not clear whether or not they appeared before or after the fireworks as I was chasing down a hatchling.<br /><br />To echo other comments, I recommend having a target macro, with a nearby key bound to &quot;Interact with Target&quot;. I also turned on Target on my mini-map. Hang out closer to the water or otherwise away from the statue. Everyone else on my server was all crowded by the statue.<br /><br />I was easily able to snag a hatchling within seconds of it appearing by spamming the target macro and interact with target keybind. I was mounted in case I needed to move away from the crowd as it shifted.<br /><br />I captured my pet on Doomhammer (US). There was less than a dozen characters at the festival when they spawned. I mention this as we are a low-medium pop server and this may be a good location to capture yours.<br /><br />Good pet hunting and may all your wild pets be rares!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Azuraa</b></h3>I recommend, if possible, to have an alt from the opposing faction ready and waiting at the beach in case you run into problems with ganking.<br />I was logged onto my Alliance main waiting for the 11pm spawn, when a Horde guild of about 10 showed up and started ganking me and the other Alliance member there. I logged onto my Horde alt (who was sitting in Org), and flew all the way there. But by the time I had arrived they had killed all the Wanderer's Festival Hatchlings ... yes KILLED them. /Sigh ... really frustrating.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>20486</b></h3>From my experience last Sunday (5/12/13), the times to get the achievement are spot on: <br /><br />Sunday, server time:<br /><br />9pm - opening<br />9:23 - closing<br /><br />11pm - opening<br />11:23 closing<br /><br />My advice is once you hit the cheevo, turn around and grab one of the three turtles making their way to the water. If you stand in the middle of the statue, and in the middle between the statue and the ocean, you should be able to get the achievement and whirl around and grab the pet...<br /><br />I settled with a poor quality one, mainly to be friendly to other tamers... they <u>DO NOT</u> respawn at the closing of the festival, so don't waste your time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>widderwise</b></h3>I play on the EU server (Turalyon) and found that the ceremony started at 9 *PM* server time, not AM as was stated earlier.<br /><br />Be prepared beforehand by having the correct pets set. I had forgotten that I had logged out in the wrong place from a previous rare spawn spot (waves fist at Jaguero Island and lack of rain) and I had my main team in place. When I got to the festival it had already started and there were already tamers out there at spawn spots, so I'd missed the initial spawns. Or so I thought. I found a Wanderer north of the statue that had been missed.<br /><br />I made the mistake of using my Qiraji Guardling's (Rare level 25) opening move of Sandstorm (strong attack against the Wanderer) against the poor quality spawn and 1 shot it when it crit. Needless to say I was rather unhappy about that. I wasn't sure if they would respawn during the ceremony. In my haste and panic between switching to desktop and back again (hoping not to miss an opportunity - maybe they spawned fast, I didn't know) to find out I didn't see any comments to that effect. <br /><br />I can confirm that the Hatchlings *will* respawn whilst the ceremony runs if you don't get one from the start of the event. The respawn time is, however, the same as normal pet respawns of around 20 minutes. The other tamers had left, presumably thinking that was it for another week, while I stayed and prayed, and *pop* another turned up. <br /><br />This one was common quality and had higher health, which was lucky since the Qiraji's Sandstorm crit again leaving 100 health left. Thankfully it leaves no dots behind, I've lost so many rares in my haste to bring the health of a rare down for taming only to lose it due to many missed traps and a dot finishing it off.<br /><br />After all this time these guys are still sought after, so as people have said before: Don't try farming for a rare quality; take any you can get and use a battlestone to upgrade it.</div>

If anyone else already has one, consider going and recording the spawn coords. I'll do the same.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>48932</b></h3>Update on the event as of patch 6.1<br /><br />US-MoonGuard Server, 09 MAR 2015<br /><br />Event started at midnight Pacific DAYLIGHT time (3 a.m. Eastern DAYLIGHT time)<br /><br />At 3:03 a.m. server, five Wanderer's Festival Hatchlings spawned. This corresponded to the first large wave of fireworks going off. Most of the spawns were concentrated around 73,32 map coords (west end of the beach, NOT right at the statue).<br /><br />I then hung around until 3:30 a.m. server; there were no respawns at the end of the event.<br /><br />Between this and other 6.x notes, it looks like the 9 and 11 p.m. PST times (and the 10 p.m. and midnight PDT times) are still in effect. As noted, PDT started on Sunday, March 8th, so plan accordingly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Eaglecreek49</b></h3>Went without researching how difficult it is to get one of these. Over 50 players trying to grab the 3 I saw spawn made this a disappointing hunt.Add in a few hours of bad rng while fishing for Lunkers and you start to wonder if maybe its even worth it these days.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TimeTrap</b></h3><a href="/item=86586/panflute-of-pandaria">Panflute of Pandaria</a> will effectively steal the 6 spawn point critters. If you keep applying it, you can make it so no other <a href="/npc=67022/wanderers-festival-hatchling">Wanderer's Festival Hatchling</a>s spawn. <br /><br />I found this out by accident, rather than malice. After I caught my first hatching(it was uncommon) I wanted to catch another, hopfully of better quality. I don't like squishing critters, so I used my flute to gather them all while I waited for respawn, I ended up with 6 in total, and there are 6 spawn points for the <a href="/npc=67022/wanderers-festival-hatchling">Wanderer's Festival Hatchling</a>, which incedenlty never respawned. <br />A real shame too, because I was the only one around at the time so there was no competition.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Silvansaria</b></h3>I was able to grab the first spawn of these little guys BUT - in the mix there was a rare spider so I killed the turtle, killed the otter that was with them, and caught the spider and then waited for more to spawn but they never did...<br /><br />Now I know why after reading all these comments and feel stupid :( It was a white turtle but I can easily turn it into a rare with the bought stone from the pet dailies. So either I wait for the 11pm spawn and see if I can snag it or wait until next Sunday with my new found knowledge...<br /><br />...oh well :/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kavkim</b></h3>I missed the 9:00 - 11:00 server time Sunday night ( 7-9 my time ), so I watched a movie. After the movie I decided go to Turtle Beach just to see. I was hovering when I looked down and saw all these lanterns appear in the water. I went down to investigate and there where people all over he beach. Then it popped up that I got my Wanderers, Dreamers and You achievement. I got 5 Hatchlings since no other players where around, Yay. Server time was 12:50 when it started and it was over at 1:20 ( 10:50 - 11:20 my time ). I don't know why time was different or why it only lasted 30 minutes but I'm happy.</div>

I had warned people on lfg chat about it, and some said that 21:00 (server time), some got them too, so I presume I was on the 2 event.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>607674</b></h3>For anyone hunting this pet still, I <i>highly</i> suggest downloading the Cross Realm Assist add-on. I went tonight for the second time (first time I didn't realize there was a pet to be had here). My realm was swarmed with people and the handful of pets were snatched up quickly. I used the add-on to join 2 random groups and the 2nd one I joined, there was nobody on the beach and I was able to snag it right away (a rare at that!).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tonydizzle</b></h3>There is a lot of talk about these spawning or not respawning throughout the event, but one thing I didn't find mentioned is that they definitely do not respawn if you forfeit the battle. I managed to snag one and tried to forfeit to give it to my wife, and it never respawned after forfeiting the battle. Unfortunate that Blizz has made it impossible to be nice with this pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SoulsaltsMJK</b></h3>TONIGHT: I was just about to start the Molten Core and my alarm I have set for this festival went off(set for 10:58p).. I quickly teleported to the Shrine of Two Moons(Horde Mage) and flew down to the festival area... That took me in total about two minutes. It was 11:00p by the time I looked back at the clock. There were 6 of these pets up when I made it, and as soon as I landed on the ground, EVERY SINGLE ONE was taken into battle. The fact that they took away CRZ is beyond me, <u>ONLY</u> for the fact that there are realms FILLED with players and others that are almost dead. It'd be wonderful if there were maybe more spawns, OR if Blizzard would make this a longer event with re-spawning battle pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kewlzilbot</b></h3>So, I can't help you with great &quot;event start time debate&quot; because my server is a PST server (so it works exactly as stated for me at 9pm/11pm PST), BUT I wanted to share some other interesting tidbits.<br /><br />I went to the shore about 35 min before the 2nd (11pm PST) ceremony was supposed to start, and the Wandering Herald was NOT there. I kept looking for him for a half hour, and he never spawned. I started to worry I had the time wrong, but decided I'd stay anyway, because I'd already been there a half an hour. Low and behold! The event did indeed start at 11pm server/PST right on time. <br /><br />It seems the festival waits for no herald...<br /><br />I mention this because I saw a few people come to the beach, wander around, check out by the statue, didn't see the Herald and left. The pets spawned right after opening ceremony (takes about 3 min as previously stated by others), so it seems those poor fellows missed out. <br /><br />Additionally, I saw an older post that said if you forfeit the battle the pet de-spawns. <u>This is not correct</u>. It so happens there were quite a few extra pets on the beach for me after I caught mine, and the one I caught was poor, so I started another battle, found another poor and forfeit. The pet re-spawned without issue so others could catch it if they would like. <br /><br /><b>Morals of the story:</b><br />1. Stick it out, even if you don't see the herald.<br />2. Feel free to start &amp; forfeit to your desire if you're looking for a particular breed (or checking for rares).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Celea</b></h3>This event starts around 12:01am EST on a Monday morning, as the NPCs wander onto the beach and set up their bonfires, the achievement rings in at 12:02am EST. 5 Wanderer's Festival Hatchlings spawn in a small area on the beach, but CRZ limits ~10 players before you're phased out somewhere else.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jkizis</b></h3>Confused. If EST is 12am and 2am, is it sunday morning or monday morning?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Crucru74</b></h3>There hasn't been a post in a while so I thought I would verify what I've seen. I went to the spot on the map in Pandara marked on map, but as many posting state, its to the west on the beach, at the turtle statue. At midnight, EST, lanterns filled the water and Pandaran started coming to the statue. This continued for about 15-20 mins when there were fireworks. The Announcer stated Thank you for attending. I got the achievement at this time but I didn't see any pets.<br /><br />I stayed at that spot until 2 am EST when the same event repeated but with more fireworks and that is when the pet spawned for me. I saw at least 5 people getting pets. Mine was a green quality and I didn't see any more to tame after that. I stayed another 15-20 mins and again, the Announcer said, Thank you for coming. <br /><br />Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>keshka4life1</b></h3>With an add-on I have I noticed when I went into krasarang Wilds that I didn't have this pet when I arrived everything was up and a bunch of people were waiting so I started checking back around every hour usually five to 10 minutes before the hour, around 1 a.m. my time fireworks went off and everything started to disappear no pet, reading through comments on here it seemed like pets would spawn at opening ceremony and closing ceremony but nothing spawned at closing ceremony for me just a heads up for anybody trying to get this pet in BFA</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>keshka4life1</b></h3>Ok I want to add this to this topic because I cannot find any mention of what happened to this event, at some point blizzard decided to change the wanderers festival from every Sunday to every December 7th every year I'm not sure why but that is what happened for some reason I cant find this topic online really so here it is.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nordrassil1</b></h3>An update for late 2020:<br /><br />Yes, it happens every Sunday. Have War Mode off. I think there were maybe 8 or so people at my festival and plenty of time to grab one of these pets. As I'm typing this there are still at least 2 or 3 available with no competition. I got 2 actually - one green quality and one grey. They spawned in a number of places at the east and west directions, but not on the extreme far ends like another comment suggested. The achievement popped right after the fireworks ended at the beginning of the festival, and the turtles spawn right after that. Before this, you'll see Pandaren slowly gather at the beach and lamps in the water. Whole festival lasted maybe 20-25 minnies.<br /><br />TURN ADDONS OFF. My game crashed x2 and I only have 2 addons lol.<br /><br />Really cute little festival; highly recommend attending it once.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SuperQue</b></h3>Confirmed this does still happen every Sunday. The <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=73594/wandering-herald">Wandering Herald</a> npc was standing next to the turtle statue and when spoken to said the festival would begin soon and to check &quot;at the top of the hour&quot; which would be at 23:00 server time (EU server). I got nervous since nothing happened for a couple minutes, but at 23:02 he started walking to the left, other npcs arrived and the festival started. After the initial round of fireworks, I got the achievement. The festival ended at 23:26.<br /><br />5 hatchlings spawned - 1 rare, 1 uncommon, 1 common and 2 poor. No-one else was around so I battled them all - no respawns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cupkin</b></h3>Just waited for the event to start and missed out on the pets on my hunter, so I swapped to a different toon with WM on and ended up with ZERO competition for them - got a lil rare boy! 2am server time, 3am local (AST).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tsaavik</b></h3>Just a 9.1 update. I did this last night. Started a minute or two after 9:00pm PDT. (11PM server time on Greymane).<br />Lanterns appeared in the water first, then a bunch of Pandarians showed up. Finally the pets spawned. There were 4-5 groups of 3 of various species and rarities.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maxmass</b></h3>I came here to check the event time and I saw it as Sunday 9-11 pm PST time (which is GMT -8) and I brought my character to there just now (Sunday 21:15 EU server time ) as I was going to sleep and wanted to logout in there to prepare for the event, when I reached there I saw the pet (Wanderer's Festival Hatchling) up and I did take it while wondering how, at 9:23:45 pm exactly I got the achievement as the event finished. <br /><br />So here I'm telling you times seems has changed and as I read here that the event last 2 hours then it means it started around 07:23 pm server time (Winter Time). <br />I hope this info helps...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Inkjoy7</b></h3>This is on my calendar as happening on a Wednesday (tomorrow), so I'm puzzled since it should be on a Sunday...Don't know if this is a change with the Dragon Isles expansion or ?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>walkndreamer</b></h3>2/26/2023<br />Festival spawns on Sundays 9pm <s>and 11pm</s> PST. convert your time to PST and go off of that, it will take a few minutes for the Hatchlings to spawn, I began seeing them about 5 minutes after Festival started, I also initiated a random nearby sea dragon pet battle while I waited and when I got don't there were hatchlings. Good luck, have fun and enjoy the fireworks!<br /><br /><b>Correction, event might only be 30 minutes!</b> I went down at 9pm PST according to my RL time, I'm on CST so that was 11pm. I got there right after 9pm PST/11PM CST because I was flying but it was like a minute or two after and fireworks were going off. I believed this to be the start of Festival as I was there and 8pmGMT/10pmCST and nothing was happening, popped on wowhead saw the GMT post further up and decided to wait, left the area about 8:15pm PST/10:15pmCST to do other things for 45 min. Was able to do 2 pet battles and they stopped spawning 9:23pm PST/11:23pm CST was annoyed there was a spawn timer...or so I assumed! Then I got the achievement for seeing the festival end like 5min later...so not sure going to check it out next Sunday if I'm not working and see what's up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>YodasEvilTwin</b></h3>Coordinates to the exact spot on Turtle Beach, Krasarang Wilds where I battled one of these guys:<br />/way #418 72.25, 31.72<br /><br />Two spawned at that point (and several elsewhere on the beach, 8-10 total) at 9:03pm PST, and one at 11:03pm PST -- right after the initial fireworks finish and the achievement goes out for anyone new. No extra pets spawned after those at the start, so there's no advantage to sticking around until the event ends (20 minutes later).<br /><br />I used a macro to help:<br /><br />/tar Wanderer's Festival Hatchling<br />/script SetRaidTarget(&quot;target&quot;, 6)<br /></div>
