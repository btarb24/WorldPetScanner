I found several up at a time. Seems like they are always Uncommon quality.<br /><br />Due to their ease to obtain, they are a great alternative to the <a href="/npc=127857/twilight-clutch-sister">Twilight Clutch-Sister</a>, sharing the <a href="/pet-ability=1890/twilight-fire">Twilight Fire</a> and <a href="/pet-ability=1960/twilight-meteorite">Twilight Meteorite</a> abilities, which are very overpowered, especially in the new 8.2 Legendary pet battles. <br /><br /><div class="quote-box">/way Twilight Highlands 19.69. 55.11</div><br /><br />As it is wild, you cannot cage it and therefore cannot sell it on the Auction House.(##RESPBREAK##)268##DELIM##Buuloki##DELIM##</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jtrezzo</b></h3>All of the ones I saw were uncommon.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gbh102</b></h3>Few words to add from me:<br />- this pet is absolutely adorable looking ;)))<br />- battlewise (in both, PVE &amp; PVP), it's a DEMON (even after 9.0.1 prepatch nerfs), also has three WORTHY breeds ;)))<br />- since Dragonkin family is actually most beloved by me, yet another instance of its kind is ALWAYS welcome !<br />- and finally, cherry on the cake :)... it's hassle free and farmless to get :)))<br />And it's really really good BATTLE pet ! <br />Love it !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wowdm6</b></h3>Looks like there might be some phasing going on here, so if you can't see any i suggest taking a character that has done most of the quests, not sure which ones though.<br />Sent a level 82 that had not done cata quests and could not see any, sent my main lvl120 and could see three pets up, relogged back to lvl82 and nothing, so either a different realm phase or some quest phasing going on. Both characters on same realm.<br />I could see critters but no battle pets.<br />Hope that helps if you can't see any.<br />On my main caught 3 within a few minutes.
