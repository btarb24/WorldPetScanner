<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Arianwen</b></h3>There has to be a part missing in the stages so far discovered for Jenafur, especially for someone just to randomly head to Karazhan and discover a few clues . What exactly lead that person to Karazhan in the first place? All we have so far is the NPC mentioning that she hopes her cat is alright.<br /><br />As someone else discovered a clawed food bowl in Elwyn in the crazy cat ladies ( vendor) house and un-moveable kibble, it got me to remembering that there is also a crazy cat lady in Boralus town, with a house full of clickable cats that you can stroke. Nothing yet to be found in the house... or is there? I happened to spot one kitty staring into a fishtank .. i clicked on the fishtank and got a Pepe buff with him wearing a deepsea diving helmut ... who knows what else is there? Maybe nothing.</div>

It does matter where you place the food. <br />-	If you accidentally place the wrong food down, you can go back to get the food and place it down in the correct spot.<br />-	Food on the floor will despawn after some time. Itâ€™s okay. Once you place a food down in the correct spot, you get credit for it.<br />-	Once you have placed all the food in their correct spots, Jenafur will spawn. <br />-	Turn your music volume up while youâ€™re doing this puzzle.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Danaan</b></h3>If you want to get her quickly, do the prerequisits (talk to Amara, click the Dish) and look for a group in the LFG tool.<br />Once someone has solved the puzzle, the same instance can be shared among players.<br /><br />The only think you need are the prereqs in order to interact with Jenafur.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SerroDan</b></h3><a href="/npc=159783/jenafur">Jenafur</a>'s secret is quite possibly the hardest one Blizzard has set out, taking the secret finding community almost a year to solve the last step!<br />For a quick video guide <a href="https://youtu.be/CgUsuOp-L2k" rel="nofollow">click here.</a><br /><br /><b>Step one</b> will take you to <a href="/npc=159799/amara-lunastar">Amara Lunastar</a> in Ashenvale:<br /><div class="quote-box">/way 17, 49</div><br />Talk to her and reassure her that you will look out for her cat.<br /><br /><b>Step Two</b> takes you to the Crazy Cat Lady, <a href="/npc=6367/donni-anthania">Donni Anthania</a>, in Elywnn Forest:<br /><div class="quote-box">/way 44,53</div><br />Inside there will be a bowl which you can interact with, and clicking on it you will discover some strange marks on the rim.<br />Following on from here, the kibble laid out on the floor points over to <a href="/zone=8443/return-to-karazhan">Return to Karazhan</a> if they were traced out onto the map.<br /><br /><b>Step Three</b> is the aforementioned hardest step. But to execute is pretty simple. When you're inside, clear right up to the first boss and you'll soon find yourself staring down the Opera Hall and this is going to be your main stage for the finale. In here you will be placing down 8 foods within the tiles on the floor, and the 8 foods can be found within the Guest Chambers and the Banquet Hall. These foods are:<br /><ul><li><a href="/npc=160372/slathered-rib">Slathered Rib</a> x1</li><li><a href="/npc=160373/meaty-morsel">Meaty Morsel</a> x1</li><li><a href="/npc=160370/marbled-steak">Marbled Steak</a> x2</li><li><a href="/npc=160371/juicy-drumstick">Juicy Drumstick</a> x2</li><li><a href="/npc=160374/fishy-bits">Fishy Bits</a> x2</li></ul><br /><br />With these foods you will need to place them in a specific Pattern within the Opera Hall. This is very easily displayed in guides and or the linked video but for the purpose of me starting something here I'll try to represent the food combinations below:<br /><br />______________EXIT____________<br />_____________________<br />____________<br />______<br /><br /> KEY:<br /> 1 = Juicy Drumstick<br /> 2 = Marbled Steak<br /> 3 = Fishy Bits<br /> 4 = Meaty Morsel<br /> 5 = Slathered Rib<br /><br />==============================<br /> ---------STAGE--------<br /><br /><i>Please refer to guides rather than the above text, it is clearer to see the pattern that way.</i><br /><br />Once all the foods are place correctly you will head some unique in game music so make sure your volume is up. You will then see <a href="/npc=159783/jenafur">Jenafur</a> wandering about in the Opera Hall, Click on her to get your Battle Pet!<br /><br />Full credit to this secret goes to The secret Finding Community and for PaulyTark who pieced the last piece of this puzzle!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>spacemanspiff777</b></h3>Curiously, <a href="/npc=159783/jenafur">Jenafur</a> will remain summoned while a player character is on a flying mount! Not sure if this is a bug, or if any other non-flying companion pets exhibit the same behavior (typically, land-bound companion pets despawn when a player character mounts up and takes flight). If you target <a href="/npc=159783/jenafur">Jenafur</a> while flying, you can see her racing along the ground to keep up with you! Vertical range does not seem to be an issue either: I flew my character to the flight &quot;ceiling&quot; and <a href="/npc=159783/jenafur">Jenafur</a> remained targeted the entire time. Also tested this with my Druid and works identically.<br /><br />Could make for some fun shenanigans: Group up with some friends, all with <a href="/npc=159783/jenafur">Jenafur</a> summoned, fly around a Capital city (or any other popular player hangout, like Goldshire Inn) and create a crazy cat invasion! I can just imagine all the players on the ground wondering where in the world all these cats came from.<br /><br /><i>For clarification, the above is accurate as of this posting: September 14, 2020 10:30pm EDT. Expect changes.</i><br /><br /><i>Edit: Apparently mountains are no obstacle for <a href="/npc=159783/jenafur">Jenafur</a>. Just flew from the Valley of the Four Winds into the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, and she scaled that mountain range like a champ!</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Freesya</b></h3>Jenafur has some really disturbing whispers:<br /><br />- Only blood will quench my thirst.<br />- Feed me souls.<br />- Your eyes look tasty.<br />- Your flesh smells delicious.<br /><br />Apart from <br />- purring<br />- loud meowing<br />- staring at something intently.<br /><br />Gives me the hibbie jibbies and makes me wonder, if her appearance isn't only a step for something that will conclude in Shadowlands.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rubinova</b></h3>Since people started to make groups for obtaining her - don't bother if You haven't done bowl clicking and You can't see foods once entering instance. I had loads of people joining me who couldn't see gear icon on her once she spawned. They could target her and see her but not obtain. Solution to that was just re-do steps until entering Kara. They could go into instance and click previously spawned cat to obtain the pet.<br /><br />Inviting new people to instance with already done secret ended up in re-doing it. New peeps couldn't see the spawned cat nor party leader.<br />Once You obtain Jena, You wonâ€™t see foods anymore but You can still see the cat when spawned.</div>

It was very cool to hear that !<br />A feature i woulda never noticed if i had only summoned her the one time so figured id let u guys know :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Fuzzywuzher</b></h3>Got her today.

Don't be like me. <br /><br />Try 3 was a success, and after a small photoshoot with my new best friend, I hearthed back to Boralus.<br /><br />I sat down by the fire to log out, and <a href="https://imgur.com/a/H8B1rnA" rel="nofollow">Jenafur hopped up onto my lap for some pets</a>.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Silvansaria</b></h3>Vulpera BM Hunter<br /><br />It took me a couple (a few) tries to get this all straight. I either forgot one of the food parts or put one of the food parts on the wrong square or ran out of time...<br />So my best advice is use a speed buff, take a deep breath, and focus on what you're doing. I also had the video instructions running on the other monitor as I did it which helped. But for a BM Hunter - I had the talent: TRAILBLAZER activated, in addition to using my Aspect of the Cheetah and the Soulshape Night Fae Covenant ability.<br /><br />When I got to the Opera Hall - I had 4 minutes left on all the food, took my time, followed the steps of the video, and easily completed the little food floor puzzle and got the pet.<br />Also - remember when the food is placed you have an additional 5 minutes so if you're starting to run out of time on the food - PLACE IT!<br /><br />You should be fine :)<br />Good luck and future gratz!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dawnrider</b></h3><div class="quote-box">This cat is known for her lies, ignore her sweet meows.</div><br /><br />So, my ex girlfriend and I started playing WoW in TBC. She made a hunter, who I named Jenafur. She ended up cheating on me a lot, and lying to me and we broke up before MOP. Then this cat gets released. Many times she has contacted me through the years acting like she misses me and regrets us breaking up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lizzurd</b></h3>As of May 19th, she appears to be back to her old self with the correct fur pattern/eye colors :)<br /><br /><a href="https://imgur.com/a/VKNrpdu" rel="nofollow">https://imgur.com/a/VKNrpdu</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AuthorBaby</b></h3>Maybe I am just in the minority here but I kinda liked Jenafur's new look more as the gray/yellow eyes (tho her having purple eyes would be cool)? Stripe look is fine and all, but she looked more unique than all the other cats in game I dunno. Kinda sad about it tbh :(</div>
