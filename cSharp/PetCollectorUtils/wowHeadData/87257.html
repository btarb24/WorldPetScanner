<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DaddysKitty</b></h3><b>Attention Horde Hunters!</b><br /><br />We can do this without help from special items or having a friend slow-fall us! <br /><br />Simply climb the hill behind your barn, the one covered in gobby workers. Face away from the barn, and disengage onto the roof. If you land on the lower section, that's okay. Walk to the end of the roof that is closest to the platform. Stand on the tip of the spike on the corner of the roof. Face away from the balcony and angle your back toward the corner of the balcony ledge. Disengage, and if angled properly, you should land on it. Voila!</div>

A bit easier than all the (creative) methods of getting it from the loft...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>multiversekyle</b></h3>Obviously, the strategy depends somewhat on where you have our barn placed but once you get on the top it's the same. My barn is in the closest spot to my Great Hall, just to the right and a little down if you are looking at your garrison map. As a hunter I was able to get up on the overhang next to my barn by going up the cliff behind my barn on the right. From there I used Disengage from the very edge of the overhang to the closest corner of the barn and get on top of the barn. From there I got out onto the big horn on the front of the barn and from there I was able to basically just drop down onto the ledge. Not too difficult once you get on top of the barn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>newvenari</b></h3>Having only 2 barns myself, I thought if i joined a friend's group to enter his garrison, i could loot his glass of warm milk.<br /><br />I was unable to. I guess I need to build a third barn after all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rades</b></h3>Easy to get for Horde players, solo, without any tricky jumps, movement abilities like Disengage, or goblin gliders. <br /><br />Place the level 3 barn at the large plot closest to your town hall. Mount up, leave your garrison out the west gate, turn left and climb up the mountain, go all the way up until you're above the barn. LEAP and land on the roof, then carefully walk/jump off the edge to land on the second-floor balcony.<br /><br />Video demonstrating this method (as well as the faster, but more difficult, side jump method): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxtCtBpA6Aw" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxtCtBpA6Aw</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cowbello</b></h3>Easiest way to loot the glass of warm milk: at the garrison Architect Table, swap the Barn's position with that of any other medium building and search the ground floor. There is no resource cost to do this. Repeat until the milk spawns on the ground floor.
