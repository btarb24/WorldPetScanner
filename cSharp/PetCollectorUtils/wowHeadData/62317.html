I DO NOT suggest sitting and camping for this. You might get slightly lucky and only have to wait a couple of hours, but on my first attempt, I had to wait for over 13 hours and then didn't even end up getting the single one that spawned. ( I have observed that only one will spawn when the timer is up. )\n\nPeople say more than one will spawn after a restart. This may be true, but I don't suggest waiting for a restart to nab one. Due to invasive CRZ, unless your specific realm is the first to come back up in your CRZ group, you won't get one. In the few short minutes it takes for your realm to come up, the others have already been up and filled with people doing exactly what you are trying to do.\n\nMy suggestion is to take this camp very lightly. Check every now and then, don't sit there and waste time waiting on one. It will save you a lot of sanity.\n\nAnd finally, if you happen to see more than one up... Take your pick and PLEASE catch only one. In 5.1, it appears there will be a way to upgrade pets to the highest battle grade, so catching more than one is only ruining someone else's chance of getting this pet.\n\nFor the actual pet itself, it is slightly taller than a gnome. So it really stands out. When clicked, it makes a low growling\/rumbling noise.. A noise you might expect to come from an infernal. However, if clicked repeatedly, it will make the chirping noise that most squirrel pets make. Very strange!\n\nEDIT: 5.1 is here and the battle stones did make it in. While they are rare, they will upgrade your pets to rare quality and increase their stats to match their new found blueness.

New spawns only occur once old ones have begun to be cleared out.  Waiting hours and hours is the result of no one clearing the other pets in the zone, which means until someone does that, you simply will not have a chance of a new spawn occurring.\n\nThis applies to Minfernals, Scorplings, Molten Hatchlings, Giraffe Calfs, and a number of others.  It does not apply to weather-dependent pets, and a handful of other rares, like the Flayer Younglings.\n\nI applied what I had observed to Minfernal hunting; no spawns were there when I visited.  I went on a battle pet killing spree (simply killing them, not battle pet fighting), and within 30 minutes I had two minfernals spawn (that I know of), one of which I captured.  Note that the battle pets do not necessarily need to be in the vicinity of the minfernal spawn area, simply in the zone itself.\n\nI am guessing that when the zone needs to spawn a new battle pet after the defeat \/ death of an existing one, a RNG determines where and what pet will spawn.  So you might get 95% common pets spawning (rats, bats, whatever), with a small chance of the rare pet you are after.  This is similar to the methodology used for fishing pools, where new pools only appear once old ones are fished out, and the type and location of the pools is random throughout the zone in question.  \n\nPlease note that any use of the term 'rare' and 'common' in this post refers only to their frequency of appearance in the game world, not their quality as a battle pet.","date":"2012-10-16T12:18:56-05:00","rating":148,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Teamed up with someone on another realm (same CRZ).

Just that I am looking at another person in the zone of the same faction, but different server.  So \/who only looks at who else in in the zone from your server, not from other servers in the cross realm.  So while Blizz says you are the only person, there can be a dozzen others from other servers, and unless you see them direct, you wont know how many are also trying for the minfernal.\r\n\r\n3. I (Medivh server) literally watched an opposing faction (Malfurion server), fly to the ground, stop moving for a minute and then see his new pet minfernal as he put it into one of the 3 battle slots.  I didn't see the minfernal at all before he went down, either on the minimap or on the ground and I was just hovering there looking.  Conclusion, I did not see it because I was not on the Malfurion server, or so it seems.  I logged onto Malfurion, made a horde toon and had a chat with the person, so I know he had only just caught it.\r\n\r\nNot only is this a fairly rare spawn, there are multiple servers all in the same area, and only some of those servers can see the spawns at any given time, or so it seems.  I have seen that there uis at least 4 servers per Xrealm, if this is true then the Minfernal population is effectively 25% of normal, add on that some cant see a given spawned minfernal, and that adds up to significant frustrations.  Then there are the players that will effectively kill all non-rare because it is not what they are wanting.\r\n\r\n*sigh*","date":"2012-11-02T01:51:53-05:00","rating":35,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"It would explain why NPCScan triggers so often for the pet, but I am never able to target it.

It was a very quiet night, even for the population our realm shares with CRZ.

I recall moments when I would see two to three consecutive rats spawn in the area. This trend continued as large quantities of battle pets (aprox 20+) were killed in the zone. After 70 mins of testing, and around 27 Minfernal-area spawned rats, we found [b]zero[\/b] Minfernal spawns itself.\n\n[b]Conclusions:[\/b] I do think the spawn rate of Shatter Scar Vale (and perhaps other area spawns alike) battle pets is correlated to the overall refreshing of the zone population. While rats and the minfernal seem to share similar spawns, it would be [i][u]PLAUSIBLE[\/u] [\/i] if not [i][u]COINCIDENTAL[\/u][\/i] that this method produces faster Minfernal spawns. Even though I did not record time stamps of when rats spawned in the area vs the amount of pets killed in the zone, I still think an hour of pet killing is sufficient evidence that RNG plays a [b]major[\/b] role in dictating the pet that spawns in the SSV. \n\nIf I ever care to, I may do a recorded test with spawn timestamps and pet kill counts, but for now I will just put up with my common quality Minfernal. \n\n\nHope this provides some insight to the matter.","date":"2012-11-12T04:29:32-06:00","rating":29,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Your test shows that non-rare pets are handled somewhat like non-rare mobs, where more killing speeds up respawns.

I logged out there without thinking much about my location and now when I logged in I saw one of them and grabbed it instantly.

But since most campers focus on the \"main area\" where the black circles on the minimap are closer together they couldn't see the one in the corner. So don't waste your time camping, staring at the screen for hours. Instead log in every now and then because at some point you are guaranteed to find one if you're patient.

I choose low population pvp servers hoping that this would give me a better edge.  An hour later I log into the Brazilian server to start my rounds of the area. It was 4 server time and Immolatus spawned. I killed him. I ran around some more and killed two more Fernals. Ten mins after I killed the rare spawn a minfernal showed of poor quality. Tamed it!

Found another minfernal spawn of low quality. Left it. Switched over to Brazilian and found another minfernal of low quality in the same area as the Oceanic one. I left that one for the other toon who was running around to grab. \n\nBottom line try after the Immolatus spawn. \n\nAlso, for those who are flying over and get CRZ minfernals showing up, you might try making the target minfernal macro and binding your interact with target key.

Many thanks to all for the appreciative comments.  Best of luck to all still searching for this pet.[\/b]\n\n***\n\nHere's how to make CRZ work for you!  \n\nYou [b]can[\/b] capture this pet while on the flight path, you just have to take the right path!\n\nAs several comments have noted, you can often see plenty of Minfernals, Scourged Whelplings, Robo-Cubs, etc. while you're on the flight path\/gryphon from one zone to the other.  However, upon landing, you will no longer be able to see these spawns, since when you land in Felwood (in this case), you enter the zone on your actual realm, so those spawns you saw as you flew over were CRZ spawns that phased out upon landing.\n\nSo the trick is to enter combat with them while on the flight path. This [i]is[\/i] currently possible for pet battles -- simply bind a key to \"Interact with Target\" and spam that key when you're in range of the spawn you want to battle.  \n\nI know a few others have tried this, unsuccessfully, on the Minfernal and had been unable to get close enough to the pet.  However, [b]I can confirm that it does work, even for Minfernals, you simply have to take the correct flight path.[\/b]  You need a flight that will fly you directly over Shatter Scar Vale and that will take you low enough\/close enough to interact with the Minfernals.\n\n[ol]\n[li]Start in [b]Mt. Hyjal at the Nordrassil flight path.[\/b]  Hyjal is generally on a different CRZ than Felwood, so once you are in Hyjal you will enter a different zone. This part is important, otherwise you're just flying from path to path within your own realm.  This flight path will work for Horde or Alliance characters.  (However, if you find after a few attempts that this particular path doesn't work, another option for Horde characters is to fly from [b]Orgrimmar to Whisperwind.[\/b]) [\/li]\n\n[li]Make a targetting macro of your choice.  The most basic requirement is:\n\n[code]\/tar Minfernal[\/code]\n\nbut if you like to add in fancy things like sounds, screenshots, and the like, feel free.  \n\n[i](However, do note that if you use a whisper mod such as WIM, you may not want to include macro code that will whisper you upon finding the spawn, as I found that these mods can steal focus in your window, such that spamming your \"Interact with Target\" key ends up typing in the chat box instead.[\/i])  [\/li]\n\n[li]Bind this macro to a key.  I like 4.  [\/li]\n\n\n[li]Under Esc > Key Bindings > Targeting Functions, bind a separate key to \"Interact With Target.\"  I chose the period key so that I could hit one button with my left hand and the other button with my right hand.[\/li]\n[li]Now, from Hyjal, [b]take the flight path down to Wildheart Point[\/b].  When you choose the taxi path at the flight master, you will notice that this flight path includes a directly vertical line from Whisperwind Grove to Wildheart Point.  This path is going to fly you right over Shatter Scar Vale but, what's more, the gryphon WILL take you low enough to interact with Minfernal spawns![\/li]\n[li]While on the gryphon, wait until you pass through Irontree Woods, then start pressing your targeting macro.  As you pass through Shatter Scar Vale if there are other Minfernals up in the CRZs you're flying through, you'll be able to target one.  [\/li]\n[li]Once you have a target acquired, spam the heck out of your \"Interact with Target\" button. It will require a little bit of luck and may require a few tries, but there are Minfernals walking around that you will be low enough to interact with.  [\/li]\n[li]If you don't get the pet, once you land at Wildheart Point just fly back to Hyjal and try again.  Bonus:  If you don't already have your Nordrassil Wisp from Hyjal, you can use the same tactic to capture that pet on your return flight.[\/li]\n[\/ol]\n\nI was able to acquire mine using this method at [b]41.06, 42.36[\/b].  Once I had the target, I just spammed the \"Interact with Target\" button until I came within range, then I was successfully pulled into the pet battle.  \n\nThen just complete the pet battle, capture the Minfernal, and once you leave the fight your gryphon ride will continue.  You will probably disconnect upon landing at the gryphon, but you've already captured the Minfernal, which you will still own upon login.  \n\nIt took me four flights total back and forth from Hyjal to Wildheart Point to enter into the battle and to get the timing right, but I'm now the proud owner of a poor quality Minfernal (and a Flawless Magic Battle Stone).  \n\nBest of luck, and happy hunting!\nMyx","date":"2013-01-17T16:46:14-06:00","rating":210,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":1,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Just to let people know.

Sometimes it's just a critter, sometimes it's a catchable battle rat.  Well, I kept killing that rat because I had nothing else to do.  When it would respawn, it would always respawn as a rat.  \n\nExcept for the last time.  It spawned right in front of me as a Minfernal... I couldn't believe my eyes.

This morning I saw at least five or six Minfernals, and it looked like two were close enough to the flightpath to be grabbed. Moreover, I can confirm that pet battles can still be initiated from flight paths (I tried with Tainted Rats).

The first night, I hadn't decided to keep track, but I killed around 40-50 based on my recollection of the vendor trash I accumulated.  Nothing spawned, so I tried again the next night, killing ~120 infernal sentries over the course of about 40 minutes (though I'm sure it would have gone faster if I had been more concentrated).  Again, after showing up 23.5 hours after I started and staying about 1.5 hours, nothing spawned.  I again killed just over 100 sentries last night in another attempt to cause minfernals to spawn for tonight.  I got lucky enough to grab a common minfernal during the day and upgrade it with a battle stone.  I checked in tonight to see if anything spawned anyway to fulfill my curiosity about this method, and again, nothing was spawned.  There are a number of contradictory anecdotes, but based on my experience, either I had very bad luck with RNG, a much larger number of infernal sentries need to be killed to have a good chance with minfernal spawns, or the people who have had success with this method have simply gotten lucky with timing.

Like most battle pets, it has the potential to be useful, but if tiers form Iâ€™d be mighty surprised to see it in the upper half.  Its first move, Crush or Immolate, is a choice between (Humanoid) damage now or (Elemental) damage over time while its second move is a choice between a long duration but small DoT and a defensive ability that you canâ€™t maintain like Shell Shield and its ilk.  The third move is no choice at all: Meteor Strike is a 2-turn move like Burrow or Lift-Off where the target is immune between beginning to execute.  Explode, on the other hand, is blatantly suicidal: though admittedly it is for very heavy damage, itâ€™s at best used for pure spite.  Iâ€™d say the best move-set is either of the first abilities, Immolation, and Meteor Strike.

It was the second one I've seen in three months, the first was just a week ago, but I was so excited that time I lost it to another player. This time he popped up right in front of me as soon as I entered the game. I'll pass along some of what I've learned that I hope will be of use to you. \n\nI succeeded using some of the tips others have posted, namely the \/tar macro and having a flying alt live there and check in with it several times a day. I found that a mining alt made this a little less tedious plus made some gold selling the Mithril on the AH.  \n\nUsing several of the flight paths posted here does indeed let you see Minfernals on other realms, but I found it impossible to get close enough to interact with them even though targeting them was easy. In addition, when I tried this on my own mount, using another combat pet, to get an idea of how close you have to be to interact with one; I found that you CANNOT interact with a pet while flying! You get a message that says \"you must be standing to interact with that pet\". (As in other cases, Bliz just means not in the air - mounted on the ground is ok). Perhaps this is a new change, but to me it makes the whole cross realm flying thing useless.\n\nThe CRZ (cross realm zones) do make this much more difficult. I don't know the exact number, but I've seen players from about fifteen realms all competing with each other for the Minfernal, \n\nI used a lvl 17 Flayer Youngling to battle Minfernal, this worked fine, but if I had it to do over a lvl16 pet would be safer (you don't want to accidentally kill him). You can always switch to a higher lvl during capture if necessary.\n\nThe suggestion to use NPCSCAN is flat out wrong, because Minfernal is automatically added to your creature cache (along with surprise, surprise, Giraffe Calf & Qiraji Guardling) and cannot be detected by NPCSCAN.\n\nGave in to my curiosity and created a DK on a low pop server; this is what I learned:\n\nThe only true low pop servers are the RPPVP ones. Tried several others including ones marked for new players and non-US servers. Ebon Hold was crowded on these & I received continuous guild invites. On the RPPVP server I was alone most of the time.\n\nI decided to send a little extra effort to get the XP & gold for flying in Kalimdor. Glad I did, not only was the searching easier, but there were enough high lvl enemy players around to ensure that I would have spent a lot of time dead.\n\nResults: Two minfernals day one, one on day two & one a week later; a definite improvement, but no panacea! You still have to deal with the erratic spawn time of  the minfernal and the occasional competing player from your own realm. NOTE: I said \"occasional competing player\", not the swarm hovering from a dozen different realms that you encounter in a CRZ.  \n\nIf I think of anything else that might be helpful, I'll edit this post.

Log in to farm at a time where most people are asleep.\r\nI have read so many strategies about farming, and the argument I seem to hear often is that this pet (despite what it's cute little icon describes) does NOT spawn when you kill their taller brethren (the Infernal Sentries). So your best bet to make sure one way or another: Kill everything. I killed Entropic Horrors, Infernal Sentries, Tainted Rats, and anything else that got in my way. \r\n\r\nI logged in at 4:33am. I captured my Minfernal at 4:59am. I killed everything, and was making complete circles around all 5 craters. I was edging around the northern-most crater when I noticed the green paw after killing an Entropic Horror. \r\nI believe that the text refers to the fact that when the Minfernal spawns, it does so in the ruins of it's larger counterpart...

Was a poor quality, H\/H. Ironically, I first heard about him today. My realm (Tol Barad) is listed as Medium pop but it's because it just does have many characters created on it, not actual player traffic. With less people to farm it, you're obviously at higher chances - so if you REALLY want this one, go and create a DK on a really, really low player traffic server. Many people go to low-pop servers to farm pets and other stuff, but you're aiming at a low traffic server. Ask your guildies, check the forums, everything counts. Once you find that realm where you're at Orgrimmar or SW in the middle of the day and it looks like it's far past midnight, then you're at the right place. \r\n\r\nHead to Felwood, go around killing (with character abilities, not battling) either battle pet rats or random non-battle (yellow name) critters around the place, don't know if really does help but everything counts if there's a chance to make Minfernal spawn. I spent literally 10min doing it, don't know if I made him spawn or he was just there, but he was there. Looks like he doesn't come as a secondary pet, you'll see him right away. Keep an eye on your minimap, it helps alot and that's how I found him (I was walking and facing the other way). If you go around flying you'll probably miss some creatures on your minimap because they take like 2-3 seconds to show there, and one of them could be Minfernal.

Recently killed critter in Shattered Scar Vale (empty critter spot)\n2. Recently killed Infernal Sentry, close to this empty critter spot.\n3. Respawn timer for Minferal off cooldown. (Others observations have caused them to doubt a respawn timer, but still might be one...?)\n4. Battle-Pet somewhere in Felwood (full zone) killed, triggering a respawn of battle pet.\n5. Very slim random chance that the spawning pet will be a Minferal.\n\nin other words...\n\nThe mechanics [i]I believe[\/i] is that each time a pet is going to be respawned in Felwood (yes, full zone), there is a slim chance of it being a Minferal. BUT, to actually spawn a Minferal, there need to be an empty critter-spot in Shattered Scar Vale, a recently killed Infernal Sentry close by AND the respawn timer for the Minferal needs to be off cooldown. I can not prove this in any way, but it would be a reasonable explanation for this pet to be almost mythologically rare... or why not say Legendary Rare.\n\n[b]About rolling restarts: Minferal will not spawn directly after a rolling restart - Blizzard has \"bugfixed\" this...[\/b]\n\nAnyone with a suggestion how to prove this, apart from getting a full raid group killing ALL in Shattered Scar Vale while another full raid group kills off all battle-pets and critters in the rest of Felwood for the duration of the respawn timer cooldown?\n\nOf course, such a proof will only work if repeated and statistically significant... but it will at the same time be able to prove if there is a cooldown timer at all...

If some yahoo was just out killing pets and then happened upon a minfernal I might agree, however, this isn't quite the case. \r\n\r\nWe know that the mechanics for node spawning, mob spawning, and yes, battle pet spawning is designed to work this way. Certain number of slots = killing to free up space for more possible spawns. This doesn't mean you can \"force\" it to spawn - just that, provided the required spawn timer has already passed and they are available in the pool of spawnable battle pets - you can greatly improve the chance for one to spawn if all of the BP slots are not full. Since this area is low level range - it makes sense that most of the battle pets are not shuffled often by being engaged. This is also why they tend to spawn upon server reset, when the slots are ALL available and they are in the pool of spawnable pets. \r\n\r\nIf using this method has NOT produced the results you were hoping for within an hour or so - my conclusion would be the spawn timer is not up and they are not in the available pool of battle pets to spawn - I would wait a few hours and try again later.\r\n\r\nAlthough I always appreciate an attempt at satire - it doesn't work well when you are attacking something that is based on sound logic, an understanding of how the game is designed to function, and the very real ability to manipulate those mechanics in your favor.","date":"2014-06-21T15:45:30-05:00","rating":-1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":342,"id":1976891,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"moippltjes","body":"wow... guess i'm pretty lucky... i was just questing when i found him... i tought he looked rather interesting so i cought him and now it turns out he's incredibly rare and hunted...","date":"2014-07-01T15:52:16-05:00","rating":-5,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":343,"id":1977656,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"76663","body":"I play on Kargath and have a character camped in Felwood in the area where the Minfernal spawns.

After the umpteenth time heading over to Felwood and seeing all the people waiting for Minfernals to spawn I figured 'Why Not?'.\r\n\r\nIn the end - I have saved myself HOURS, probably DAYS of farming thanks to my Death Knight.\r\n\r\nTook me 3-4 hours to run my Death Knight through all the quests and you must do all the quests - I tried just running out of the area and there is a giant force field blocking you (btw first death knight - never had any interest in building one and still don't).\r\n\r\nTook me about 10 minutes to get to Felwood.  There was a portal that I could take to Orgimar.  I had to finish a quest (else no one would speak to me).  It dawned on me I couldn't fly (only level 58), but no biggie - even though you haven't found all the flight masters they are already available to you.\r\n\r\nTook me about 10 minutes to scoop up 3 Minfernals just waiting around looking for adoptions.  They weren't of good quality but each had their own breed (I have plenty of charms and upgraded the P\/P one to rare).\r\n\r\nI figured while I was here I'd head over to Winterspring and nab a few Snowy Owls (Winter just started and everyone was out gathering Owls) and a Scorpling over at Blasted Lands.  And when the only Wharf Rat on my main server was in a bad location I couldn't reach - I switched over and got that too (Along with EK Safari).\r\n\r\nOh and with the money I made from selling some of the crafting material and a few green armor pieces I found I picked up some nice pets I found cheap at their AH too.","date":"2014-12-23T08:27:32-06:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":380,"id":2078403,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"DrJ105","body":"Finally got a Minfernal via the low-pop Oceanic realm method.

I followed this advice, in the morning, and found 4 in a span of 20 minutes.\n\n[quote]The future is cross-realm hopping and it works, it's fun and it's so easy to do.\n\nStep #1 - fly to the site of Minfernals or other hard to get wild pets (we also had luck doing this with scorplings, jade oozlings and wharf rats)\nStep #2 - Use that 'Looking for Group' tool and go to the custom group\nStep #3 - look for any group built for things like Kura\/Eris pet tamer, Harrison Jones, Mats Trader, Enchanter Hut or just my Garrison is open and I have Auto-Accept is open.\nStep #4 - Sign up for that group.\n\nEasy Peasy - these groups are all auto-accept so you will join immediately and cross over into their realm - monsters will suddenly shift or disappear with new ones appearing. Fly around a few minutes to see if any are there. If not just leave the group and look for the next one - 'rinse and repeat'.[\/quote]\n\nTo add to what they suggested, when joining a group this way it will show you the name and realm of the person that started the group in the group finder dialog.  It's just a matter of making a mental note of \"did I try this realm yet\" when selecting.  \n\nBe warned, if you are from a PvE realm and go this route it sometimes brings you to PvP servers, you will be flagged for PvP when you cross over.  Good thing is, when you leave the party and return to your realm the PvP flag will automatically be removed.\n\nenjoy!","date":"2015-03-29T07:11:52-05:00","rating":24,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"After hours, days, months of trying to find this guy on a popular server, I found one after 10 minutes and 5 server hops.

I parked three alts from three different servers in the area and took turns camping, trying every tactic I had read about: cross-realm hopping, constantly killing infernals, etc. After spending all day and half the night keeping constant vigil and not seeing a single one, I was ready to come here and declare that, in MY opinion, these \"Minfernals\" had obviously been discontinued and were no longer available.\n\nBut after sleeping in until well after noon today, I decided to give it one more try and logged onto my alt on Argent Dawn server. No sooner had I logged in than, lo and behold, there was a Minfernal! It was of poor quality, but I didn't care; I just wanted it. After the capture, I decided to make the rounds of the area, just for the heck of it. Within 10 seconds, I found another one! This one was also poor quality but again, I didn't care; now I'd have two of them!\nI quickly captured it and started to fly away when suddenly, there was a THIRD Minfernal! I'm thinking, \"WTF? They're suddenly everywhere!\". This third one was, again, of poor quality but I captured it anyway.\n\nUPDATE: In the past couple of days, I've been able to replace my poor quality Minfernals with uncommon ones. The best tip I can give anyone looking for these little guys is to get on Argent Dawn server. They seem to always be there when I log in to check the area out. Yesterday, there were six at one time!  I checked just now and there were two.

I tried forcing spawns by killing hundreds of the rats that spawn across the zone to free up spawns, no joy out of about 10-15 hours trying on and off; killing or battling hundreds of rats.

I would hazard a guess that they are purely a timed spawn, and can't be forced, possibly spawning 2 or 3 when they finally do.

That got patched a long time ago and it now says you cant start a pet battle while traveling.\r\n\r\n[b]Things that MIGHT help[\/b]\r\nDownload Cross Realm Assist addon and see if you can instance yourself into other realms. The catch here is that since legion is out now it will only instance you into another felwood if like somebody in that group is already in felwood. So 90% of the groups wont instance you into a new instance, but if you want its worth a try.\r\n\r\n[b]What worked for ME[\/b]\r\nMy realm is pretty busy so I followed the advice on here and made a death knight on Aman'Thul -- a low pop oceanic server. Originally I [i]really [\/i]didn't want to do that I thought it would be a waste of time, but it only takes 1 hour if you are quick. Around night time (USA time) there were very few people in the zone so less cahnce of somebody killing you\/stealing your minfernal. The downside is that you will be restricted to a ground mount, but if all your main chars are on a very busy server I would still recommend rolling an oceanic dk.\r\n\r\nI tried the strategy of slaughtering Infernal Sentrys for a combined total of maybe 4-5 hours across 3 days and got nothing. I came back on here and read a comment about killing the critters\/other battle pets and decided to try that. I had done it in the past for a few hours and not seen anything but I figured it was worth a try again. It took about 20 min of killing all the rats and moths and stuff around the pools (along with some Infernal Sentrys as well) and then a minfernal appeared on the west of the westernmost middle pool. It could have been chance, but I had been afking most of the day and running around every hour or so and seen nothing. I believe that killing critters opened up the spawn for minfernals. So if I were you I would try that.\r\n\r\n[b]The Spawn[\/b]\r\nSome notes, it was about 1:45PM on Amun'Thul, (11:45pm Eastern Time) and it was raining in the zone.... although I really don't think that matters.

When I was farming Obsidian Warbeads for hours in the same cave (just NE of Halaa), there were two mining nodes that would spawn in the cave as quickly as I could clear it.  I cleared them each time I went through and about 10% of the time at least one would be khorium instead of adamantite.  I realized itâ€™s the same with the battle pets â€“ Minfernals canâ€™t spawn if you donâ€™t clear the tainted rats.

There was always one for me to try to tame so I'd say they are very common spawn. Be warned though, they hit pretty hard and you'll have to skim some HP off of them to have a good chance of catching one. They're a magic pet so bring some dragon based pets for damaging them or critters to stop their damage.<br /><br />Edit: Well as of this build I've gotten 12+ Minfernals down under 70 HP including three at 1-3 HP and haven't been able to tame one. Not sure if they're just bugged right now or what the deal is.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Seberus</b></h3>I found several spawns, a few in the northern region, and several in the middle.<br />Unfortanetly, as of now, they are bugged. If you battle with a Minfernal, the Exp he gains at the end of the combat does not add up, but replace itself.<br />If you fight, and gain 160XP on the first combat, and 80XP on the second combat, you will have 80XP instead of 240XP.<br />Pity, since it is at the moment one of the few wild pets with attacks implemented.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Karthios</b></h3>Tried to find one for almost an hour tonight and no luck. If they are still in the current build then I just have bad luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zeterai</b></h3>Flew through to Whisperwind Grove from Orgrimmar and spotted quite a few of them on the ground around the Vale. All of them disappeared when I got back though, with nobody else in the area to have caught or killed them, leading me to assume that phasing is screwing up spotting them.<br /><br /><s>Hm. Further information leads me to think killing the infernals will force the minfernals to spawn if you do it long enough. I'll have to test it shortly.</s><br /><br />I've cut through twenty respawns of the area's Infernals or more, and still no mini ones spawning. Think that idea's proven wrong.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1013197</b></h3>the tooltip from pet journal states for the Minfernal the following: &quot;This ill-tempered constructs of flame and rage sometimes rise from the remains of larger infernals who fall in battle.&quot; - this leads me to think that there's a possibility that they have a chance to spawn when we kill an infernal from Shatter Scar Vale. Can anyone confirm this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>733071</b></h3>I spent far too much time post-Pandaria trying to locate one of these little guys, and was able to find scant information on the web about their spawning habits. I hope this post will help out anyone else in the same situation as me.<br /><br /><b>Minfernals appear to be on a rare spawn timer, spawning either singly or as a group. This timer is unconnected to the spawn timer of other Infernal rares, and it is not affected by killing/farming regular Infernal Sentries or other mobs.</b><br /><br />I have observed this spawning cycle twice now in the Shattered Scar Vale. I found posts by several beta testers claiming that Minfernals appeared in the Irontree Woods as well, but I have never seen one there, and they have NOT spawned there concurrent with the Shattered Scar spawns. <br /><br />I believe the reason it's so hard to find one is because after they spawn, just one or two pet collectors can easily burn through all the little guys trying to find a Rare for their collection. If you're not there soon after they spawn, they're going to get farmed off before you show up.<br /><br />Keep in mind that I believe this information to be accurate (as of live play 5.0.5), but my observation time has been limited and I may be off with my conclusions. As with everything else on wowhead, look at the aggregate of information before acting. I'm not claiming to be an authority, I'm just trying to help out other players scratching their heads like I was. Cross-realm nonsense may also be playing havoc with your realm's spawning/farming cycle (or mine).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1038473</b></h3>Ok so after several hours of sitting around at the camp in felwood I decided to try something different. I started to kill everything that moved in the camp, after about a hour, to my surprise a Minfernal spawned at one of the entropic horror spawn points, and started walking the same path that the horror did. <br />Currently I am working on testing the theory that they are on the same spawn cycle as the mobs in the area, and would like some help. If you kill every mob in the area, and get a Minfernal to pop instead of one of the trash mobs, post it. I think this may be the way to get them to spawn outside of a server reset.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1037343</b></h3>Finally got one of these a moment ago. Roughly 8:40 pm server time. <br /><br />Spent 45 minutes running around killing everything in the Shatter Scar Vale along with another person who appeared to be looking for the same thing. No spawns. The other guy gave up after about 15 minutes, and I finally gave up about 45 minutes later and left myself flying in the center of the Vale while I did dishes. Came back about 45 minutes later and a single Minfernal had spawned. Definitely no one else out here killing things at the time, so I do not believe that has any effect on the spawn rate. Weird that it appeared when it did too. Definitely wasn't there at 8:30.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kalnazzar</b></h3>Just spotted one of these little guys.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ScumHellfire</b></h3>A tip for people trying to get this, use your Real ID buddies to check different realms. Ask them for an invite (you must be lower or equal level to them) and check if there's any Minfernal's if not, move on to the next realm.<br /><br />Ended up finding a realm with 12 (!) spawns in it. Battled 7 until I got a rare, left the rest behind for other people.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mirai</b></h3>I found about 15 roaming around after server maintenance.<br /><br />4 of them were rare, so I was maybe just lucky or they are commonly of higher quality.<br /><br />Best farm after server restart.<br /><br /><b>Minfernal is a <u>lvl 14</u> Wild Battle Pet</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>190096</b></h3>I have managed to collect several minfernals. I quickly dispose of the poor and common variety. I have to suggest that the easiest most simple way to obtain a minfernal is to log in right after servers restart. They have always been present for me. If like me you are still pursuing a rare minfernal you can quickly flee battles that you know are poor or uncommon. <br /><br />Poor- 550hp +/- 10<br />Common - 600hp +/- 25<br />Uncommon- 650hp +/- 25<br />Rare- will update when i see one<br /><br />I have noticed that the northernmost tree (which appear as stained blotches on your minimap) in the vale contains a little minfernal inside everytime. Simply /target minfernal when you are near and run around the tree spamming your 'Interact with Target' keybind.<br /><br />Removed(##RESPBREAK##)8##DELIM##Sas148##DELIM##While I understand your frustration regarding downvotes... making comments such as these are not appropriate.

Right before I was going to bed this guy spawned!<br />I was so happy and engaged battle with him.. I used a Emerald Whelpling in the battle.<br />First hit I did about 30% damage, he made a hit on me, I needed to hit him once more to get hes health low enough to throw the trap. Then my stupid whelpling landed a critical hit and the minfernal died :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>eDGe87</b></h3>Maybe a certain amount of Infernal Sentrys has to be killed in order for them to spawn?<br /><br />If you check it in the pet journal there's sort of a tooltip saying:<br /><br />&quot;These ill-tempered constructs of flame and rage sometimes rise from the remains of larger infernals who fall in battle.&quot;<br /><br />I have been killing Infernal Sentrys in the zone for about 10 minutes, and they just keep respawning. As soon as I kill one, another one respawns, so maybe that strengthens this theory? I had no idea myself, because I'm lacking knowledge of blizzards intended spawn mechanics, but I've never seen a camp of mobs not being able to run out before.<br /><br />I will update if something positive happens.<br /><br />Edit: giving up. killed well over 300, but no pets spawned. Add a reply here if you are trying this and they do spawn. In that case, I will go back and try again myself.<br /><br />Edit: Went back, and to my surprise there was ONE minfernal there. To my further surprise i managed to capture a rare version on the first and single try, lucky me :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>106802</b></h3>Got one rare these days, after fighting 4 of them.<br /><br />There is a very easy way to find it: Just wait for realm restarts, or even maintenance tuesdays. Then you gotta log back, and you'll find plenty around in Shatter Scar Vale. Just do it ASAP, as soon as the realm is back online, or someone else will do it before you.<br /><br />BTW his respawn timers are crazy, after 7 hours searching around I couldn't find one, so I don't recommend wasting time on it.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hashupa</b></h3>After finally getting one for myself, I thought I'd share a few things I observed while camping for this thing.<br /><br />First off, it took me well over two weeks to get this thing. I DO NOT suggest sitting and camping for this. You might get slightly lucky and only have to wait a couple of hours, but on my first attempt, I had to wait for over 13 hours and then didn't even end up getting the single one that spawned. ( I have observed that only one will spawn when the timer is up. )<br /><br />People say more than one will spawn after a restart. This may be true, but I don't suggest waiting for a restart to nab one. Due to invasive CRZ, unless your specific realm is the first to come back up in your CRZ group, you won't get one. In the few short minutes it takes for your realm to come up, the others have already been up and filled with people doing exactly what you are trying to do.<br /><br />My suggestion is to take this camp very lightly. Check every now and then, don't sit there and waste time waiting on one. It will save you a lot of sanity.<br /><br />And finally, if you happen to see more than one up... Take your pick and PLEASE catch only one. In 5.1, it appears there will be a way to upgrade pets to the highest battle grade, so catching more than one is only ruining someone else's chance of getting this pet.<br /><br />For the actual pet itself, it is slightly taller than a gnome. So it really stands out. When clicked, it makes a low growling/rumbling noise.. A noise you might expect to come from an infernal. However, if clicked repeatedly, it will make the chirping noise that most squirrel pets make. Very strange!<br /><br />EDIT: 5.1 is here and the battle stones did make it in. While they are rare, they will upgrade your pets to rare quality and increase their stats to match their new found blueness. All the more reason to find it in your heart to catch one and be done!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1046597</b></h3>My experience in hunting many rarely spawning pets is that, like fishing nodes, a zone will only have so many battle pets spawned at a time. New spawns only occur once old ones have begun to be cleared out. Waiting hours and hours is the result of no one clearing the other pets in the zone, which means until someone does that, you simply will not have a chance of a new spawn occurring.<br /><br />This applies to Minfernals, Scorplings, Molten Hatchlings, Giraffe Calfs, and a number of others. It does not apply to weather-dependent pets, and a handful of other rares, like the Flayer Younglings.<br /><br />I applied what I had observed to Minfernal hunting; no spawns were there when I visited. I went on a battle pet killing spree (simply killing them, not battle pet fighting), and within 30 minutes I had two minfernals spawn (that I know of), one of which I captured. Note that the battle pets do not necessarily need to be in the vicinity of the minfernal spawn area, simply in the zone itself.<br /><br />I am guessing that when the zone needs to spawn a new battle pet after the defeat / death of an existing one, a RNG determines where and what pet will spawn. So you might get 95% common pets spawning (rats, bats, whatever), with a small chance of the rare pet you are after. This is similar to the methodology used for fishing pools, where new pools only appear once old ones are fished out, and the type and location of the pools is random throughout the zone in question. <br /><br />Please note that any use of the term 'rare' and 'common' in this post refers only to their frequency of appearance in the game world, not their quality as a battle pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>130234</b></h3>Something to keep in mind for those still hunting for a rare. If you engage in pet battle with a wild pet and find through an addon or stats that the Minfernal isn't a rare do not concede the fight, conceding will cause the pet to despawn. Instead what you can do to leave the pet intact for others to fight is to logout mid-fight, logging out causes the pet to still be there for others!</div>

There was no one there (Ravenholdt) but when I logged onto Ysera there was a dozen people. Like one guy said, if you have toons on different servers, try the lower pop server cuz chances are the CRZ for that one is better since they group them up by type.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>regards</b></h3>This pet is impossible to farm on a PVP server. Don't even try if there are any of the opposite faction in the area. Regardless of their level or how long you have been there, they can (and likely will) take you out of your pet battle, and you will lose your pet. Just roll a death knight on a PVE server and take them straight to Felwood once you finish the starter quests.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>solieus</b></h3>If rare battle pets seem like the thing of dreams, like for me, try this:<br /><br />1) Wait for a realm maintenance. Rolling restarts work too, and are easier to use since they're quicker.<br />2) Have 2-3 chars on different realms camping some spawn spots. Having them on low-pop realms helps a lot.<br />3) Wait for realms to start going down or up, then pick a character in a realm that is online. You will know you're good when you get a yellow error message in your chat log saying that your cross-realm zone is offline (sorry, don't have exact quote)<br />4) Huzzah! You are now in your *own* realm's zone without any pesky neighbouring realms to bug you! Go get those rares!<br /><br />Your window of opportunity is usually 3-5 minutes or so, but I managed to catch the Minfernal and Flayer Youngling in the same restart session. If you can get online at the right time, this method is foolproof as long as the realm you're using is not too busy on its own.<br /><br />You can even &quot;scout ahead&quot; by using flight points in the zone, since flight points don't count as cross-realm until you land.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zivy</b></h3>From my *OWN* personal experience: November 1, 2012, 12:27 pm realm time Suramar. No Minfernals to be seen.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1Palv</b></h3>I had my husband fly around Felwood and kill pets while I searched the Shatter Scar Vale for the Minfernal. While flying around, I saw the rare spawn infernal, Immolatus. I killed and looted it, and before the loot window even closed, a Minfernal spawned in the corpse. Unfortunately, it was only uncommon.<br /><br />So, it seems that a combination of killing off pets in the zone and killing infernals can get one to spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Knightyme</b></h3>My observations:<br /><br />1: If you taxi in from *outside* the zone and fly over you will often see 2,3 even 4 minfernals. Upon landing though you will be 'synced' to the cross realm zone, and all those minfernals you just saw will no linger be available.<br /><br />2: I have done a /who and found I am the only person in the zone. Just that I am looking at another person in the zone of the same faction, but different server. So /who only looks at who else in in the zone from your server, not from other servers in the cross realm. So while Blizz says you are the only person, there can be a dozzen others from other servers, and unless you see them direct, you wont know how many are also trying for the minfernal.<br /><br />3. I (Medivh server) literally watched an opposing faction (Malfurion server), fly to the ground, stop moving for a minute and then see his new pet minfernal as he put it into one of the 3 battle slots. I didn't see the minfernal at all before he went down, either on the minimap or on the ground and I was just hovering there looking. Conclusion, I did not see it because I was not on the Malfurion server, or so it seems. I logged onto Malfurion, made a horde toon and had a chat with the person, so I know he had only just caught it.<br /><br />Not only is this a fairly rare spawn, there are multiple servers all in the same area, and only some of those servers can see the spawns at any given time, or so it seems. I have seen that there uis at least 4 servers per Xrealm, if this is true then the Minfernal population is effectively 25% of normal, add on that some cant see a given spawned minfernal, and that adds up to significant frustrations. Then there are the players that will effectively kill all non-rare because it is not what they are wanting.<br /><br />*sigh*</div>

It was a very quiet night, even for the population our realm shares with CRZ. With the exception of a leveling character, we were alone.<br /><br /><b>Method: </b>I patrolled the general Shatter Scar Vale, killing any battle pet in the proximal area while my grouped partner patrolled the Felwood zone, eliminating any eligible battle pets he found.<br /><ul><li>Note - battle pets were killed by user, <b><u>not</u></b> from engaging in a pet battle.</li><li>Kills not counted.</li></ul><br /><br /><b>Results:</b> As my partner and I killed battle pets in the zone, I observed that it <b>hastened</b> the spawn of <a href="/npc=62316/tainted-rat">Tainted Rat</a> in the Shatter Scar Vale. I recall moments when I would see two to three consecutive rats spawn in the area. This trend continued as large quantities of battle pets (aprox 20+) were killed in the zone. After 70 mins of testing, and around 27 Minfernal-area spawned rats, we found <b>zero</b> Minfernal spawns itself.<br /><br /><b>Conclusions:</b> I do think the spawn rate of Shatter Scar Vale (and perhaps other area spawns alike) battle pets is correlated to the overall refreshing of the zone population. While rats and the minfernal seem to share similar spawns, it would be <i><u>PLAUSIBLE</u> </i> if not <i><u>COINCIDENTAL</u></i> that this method produces faster Minfernal spawns. Even though I did not record time stamps of when rats spawned in the area vs the amount of pets killed in the zone, I still think an hour of pet killing is sufficient evidence that RNG plays a <b>major</b> role in dictating the pet that spawns in the SSV. <br /><br />If I ever care to, I may do a recorded test with spawn timestamps and pet kill counts, but for now I will just put up with my common quality Minfernal. <br /><br />Hope this provides some insight to the matter.</div>

I got bored so I started running around and killing everything in sight, critters included. Did this for about 15 minutes and low and behold, I look at my minimap and the little guy spawned right near me (didn't look at coords, but he was northwest, near the road). Poor quality, but one step closer to the achievement :)<br /><br />Makes me think that killing either the sentries and whatnot or critters forces him to spawn? Or maybe I just got lucky...

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>khblock</b></h3>As an avid pet collector and a hunter, I am no stranger to farming for rare pets. However, this CRZ business really concerns me. After farming a few hours; I began recording the different realms represented -- count before I got a poor quality one, 28. Yep, you read correctly, 28 realms in less than one day! I realize, this is not the forum to rant on the short sightedness of developers, but I do feel it necessary to let fellow pet collectors understand what they are up against.<br /><br />Additionally, this is a quest area for lower levels. Be considerate to those leveling and do not kill everything in sight in an attempt to make minfernal pets spawn. Quest items re-spawn quickly; these pets do not. Logic dictates -- killing everything will not make them spawn faster. Also, some have reported the minfernal as a 2nd battle pet; although I've not witnessed this personally, it bothers me when people kill battle pets without attempting to discover if there is a minfernal companion. If you feel the burning need to kill something; the level 1 Tainted Rats make great target practice :P<br /><br />Have fun and good luck fellow battle pet hunters -- you're going to need it.<br /><br />Just for kicks, list of realms sighted below:<br />Grizzly Hills<br />Ysera<br />Turalyon<br />Azurmyst<br />Area 52<br />Norgannon<br />Dalaran<br />Doomhammer<br />Ghostlands<br />Khadgar<br />Thrall<br />Tanaris<br />Velen<br />Terokkar<br />Dawnbringer<br />Dentarg<br />undermine<br />Anvalmar<br />Uldaman<br />Icecrowne<br />Aerie Peak<br />Arygos<br />Duskwood<br />Gnomeregan<br />Zangermarsh<br />Blades Edge<br />Exodar<br />Galakrond</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Miatog</b></h3>Reading what the journal says about these guys I tried running around and killing Infernal Sentry and I very quickly noticed something. They seems to have a high chance to instantly respawn. By instantly respawn, I mean there's a new one standing on top of the one I just killed when the death animation STARTS. I can't help but wonder, given that with 50 kills and 45 of them had this instant respawn effect, if they pet is suposed to spawn from a kill, but they put the wrong mob in there.<br /><br />I know that this respawning wasn't due to a high population either, it was 1AM PST, /who showed nobody, I asked general if anyone was around just in case of CRZ stuff. I got no response. Now this isn't proof I was alone, but it does show that there was very few people around in the entire zone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>920932</b></h3>I just managed to get my Minfernal and for those still looking to get theirs I suggest that you keep one of your characters that you don't use for anything else and log in every now and then to see if they have spawned. Also I suggest that you log out over the fifth black circle on the minimap, the one that is by itself a bit to the right. I logged out there without thinking much about my location and now when I logged in I saw one of them and grabbed it instantly. It was of poor quality but that really doesn't matter since it will count towards the achievement anyway, but because of pure curiosity to see if there was any other ones up I flew around a little just to see 3-4 people hovering over the area camping for the pet.<br /><br />Now here's my point; I had just logged in so that Minfernal I got had probably been up for a short period of time before I got it (could be seconds but could also be minutes), not far away from the people camping it. But since most campers focus on the &quot;main area&quot; where the black circles on the minimap are closer together they couldn't see the one in the corner. So don't waste your time camping, staring at the screen for hours. Instead log in every now and then because at some point you are guaranteed to find one if you're patient. And if you really want to camp it, make sure to fly around and check the entire area regularly because you never know where it will spawn.<br /><br />Good luck hunting it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>964687</b></h3>Just caught one about 10 minutes ago. I reading various comments saying that if you kill other battle pets in the zone then it could cause a respawn of a Minfernal. I tried this for about half an hour to an hour and kept causing tainted rats (damn you for giving me heart attacks) to spawn in shatter scar vale, which lead me to believe that it could work. Anyway, i went to grab a drink, came back and saw a minfernal skipping across the dirt, battled and caught him ofc, common quality. There wasn't many people around and only one spawned at the time. So you could always try what i did and see if it works for you, just stick it out, you could be there for a while.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1049255</b></h3>I have had an alt parked in Felwood to check/camp this when I have had time. Today I finally found one, I could feel the excitement and I threw the cat away from my lap to fast mount up fly there as fast as I could.<br /><br />As I landed and was about to click the Minfernal a big Infernal aggro'd me which put me in combat. I did not notice that I was in combat before my staff was already halfway through the swing, as I was screaming &quot;Nooooo&quot; I could see the numbers 1239 pop up on my screen...<br /><br />So much time and I finally had my chance to get this pet but all the joy went away in less than a second, now I'm sitting here trying to think if I could have done something different. If I ever see a Minfernal again I will make sure to clear the area first so this wont happen to me again.<br /><br />Now I wish that I had never logged on my Mage today, I should have just stayed on my main and done dailies instead..<br /><br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/812/minfernalqq.jpg/" rel="nofollow">http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/812/minfernalqq.jpg/</a></div>

Decided to open a ticket and see if there was possibly a bug based on the pet description. The GM advised that &quot;developers are aware of a problem and working to fix it as soon as possible.&quot; Not sure if he was giving me the run around but at least it provides some hope for those who don't have time to camp this all day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hammus</b></h3>Hey guys :) I just started collecting pets yesterday, so I'm happy to say I'm apart of the pet collector's club now! I saw this little guy on my mod and thought, &quot;Hey, why not, he sounds like it would be pretty cool&quot;. So I get into the area and immediately see one in the little crater. I click on him to start the battle, but unfortunately he's only uncommon :( so I just forfeited the battle and started looking for another one. Lo and behold there's another one two craters over, and it's rare, yay! (I'm kinda glad I got it right away, I didn't want to spend a long time looking for a rare). Anywho, I logged on wowhead to post how easy it was to find these things...but it turns out some people are having a hard time with it, I had no idea. So now I'll just say: Don't give up guys, your turn is right around the corner! <br /><br />P.S. I heard someone talking in general that killing the large infernals makes the pets spawn faster.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>954889</b></h3>I was camping this pet for 2 days, and not even a sighting, so today I decided to try, and see if killing the infernals would speed things up.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>stickshift</b></h3>Even with the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=92741#see-also">Flawless Battle Stone</a> people will (and do) still camp for the rare drop...it happens. At this point, most avid collectors are where I am; I need this pet and the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62526#.">Qiraji Guardling</a> (which won't spawn until this summer) for the ultimate collector title <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/title=310">&quot;Zookeeper&quot;</a>. All other achievements can be acquired w/o this pet.<br /><br />If Blizzard is going by the same seasonal change as it does for <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=13756#comments">Raw Summer Bass</a> spawning, summer is March 20th to September 23rd. <br /><br />So, unless you're stretching it for the achievement, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=7501/thats-a-lot-of-pet-food">That's a Lot of Pet Food</a>, late February may be the least crowded time to camp. <br /><br />Edit: This is just my opinion, but I think many collectors are resigning themselves to waiting until they get the Guardling, then there will be another glut of campers in Felwood.<br /><br />EDIT 2: It seems they aren't following the seasonal aspect as I imagined. June 21st is the annual start of the Guardling.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>catadon22</b></h3>easily one of the (if not THE) most OP battle pets there is. 1st, their magical passive, which states that a single attack can't take more then 40% of their health away is HUGE. 2nd, the extra plating ability is also a huge advantage. 3rd, the damage over time effect from the immolate ability is awesome! and last, after being an un-stoppable tank and damage dealer, if that isn't awesome enough for you, the meteor strike ability (provided it doesn't miss or is dodged) will completely devastate the enemy. and, the pet is also HUGE!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1059984</b></h3>Yes sitting around and waiting for 3+ hours will work, but as stated before killing the critters in the area does help.<br />/tar Tainted Rat<br />/cast instantdeath<br /><br />I &quot;believe&quot; the reason why people have been complaining about the long spawn time, is because like many other rarer pets, these pets share spawns with other critters/battlepets in the zone, however no one really had a lightbulb moment about this fact because the minfernals still spawn randomly and at very long spawn times.<br />If you note the other beasts in the zone, you will see the wolves/bears attack critters randomly, this happens enough, a minfernal eventually spawns.<br />Nothing says you can't help it along :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bewsh</b></h3>If you're having a hard time finding this pet you can most likely thank, or blame, CRZ.<br /><br />I just took a flight path from Org to the Whispering Grove and there were 6-12 Minifernals up as I flew over the Shattered Scare Vale. As soon as I landed I'm guessing I phased/CRZ'd. I mounted up and headed over and they were gone.<br /><br />I hearthed back to Org, and did the same thing, with the same result. So, they are most certainly spawning. You're just being taken to a realm with none or phased somehow.<br /><br />I also know for a fact they weren't tamed because there are only few people afk on their mounts and the only other person actively searching can't see them either (from a different server for what it's worth).<br /><br />This is on US-Kil'Jaeden, so pretty irritating to be getting screwed by CRZ when my home server is high pop.<br /><br />Edit: Tested the same thing from Hyjal and had the same result. Then I jumped off the mountains from Hyjal into felwood and used my goblin $%^&amp;*! to fly over the vale - no minfernals. I'm guessing they're in surplus on my home realm and as soon as I set foot into Felwood and whatever server I am being phased to they're non-existent because there are 15-20 people there waiting to get lucky and compete for a single spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>angra007</b></h3>OK, everyone here is clueless... so i am going to explain the trick to get this very fast...<br /><br />follow these on the order:<br /><br /><b>1) </b>Kill all rats on the Shatter Scar Vale (this will open spawn slots)<br /><b>2) </b>Get out of the Shatter Scar Vale and player kill the Battle Pets around (toads, roaches, moths, whatever...anything u can battle, just kill it) (this will do battle pet spawn roll)<br /><br />3) Go back to Shatter Scar Vale and wait for pet spawns.... rats will have now a chance to be switched by a battle pet of the area (Minfernal)<br /><br /><b>IF U ONLY KILL RATS U WILL ONLY FORCE THE SERVER TO PET ROLL AND NOT TO BATTLE PET ROLL</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jeolene</b></h3>I'm not sure if it's just me or maybe I got the &quot;special&quot; one, I upgraded this to a rare thinking &quot;if it's this rare to find, it must be good&quot;. I'm not sure if I'd use it for anything, the attacks seem weak compared to other pets and it misses... a lot. The standard 'crush' attack always seems to do about 50 less damage than what it says at lvl25. The 'extra plating' just doesn't seem to feel like it's keeping damage down like my turtle shields.<br /><br />The meteor ability sometimes doesn't even do anything. I cast it, it goes up, comes down, sometimes it hits, most time it misses, a lot of times I don't get anything, it just crashes and that is the end of it, like I didn't even use it. Maybe there's a special niche critter it's good for, but I'd honestly stick with the usual pets over this one and I've yet to try out some of the other abilities, but I can't say as I'm impressed.<br /><br />Not really ranting, just some things I've noticed, maybe just bugs that need to be fixed, who knows</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>blkdeath75</b></h3>EASILY the most camped battle pet in the game. I have seen 10-12 players at a time from 3-4 different realms at 7am! I thought most of you chugged red bull and ate hot pockets till 3-4 in the morning, This means when I wake up at 6am for work like a normal person I find the stuff you burn out trying to find throughout the night.<br /><br />Stop staying awake all night so I can get my Minfernal!<br /><br />2 weeks and counting<br /><br />Edit: Got it Christmas morning while all the chuggers were busy looking for their Greatfather Winter Loot. No server restarts or anything, just leetsauce lookin for more free epics under the tree. Thanks downvoters!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hohen666</b></h3>I have found many of them. They are fairly easy to spawn if you are on a low pop server. I you aren't, just make a DK alt on it, once you get flying mount (only to minimize travel times) just go on a rampage on the critters occupying the <a href="/npc=62317/minfernal">Minfernal</a> and then kill any other critters you encounter. You will make space for the <a href="/npc=62317/minfernal">Minfernal</a> to spawn while actually letting it time to do so. When you've killed about 20 critters you should be fine. Just aim back to the area of spawn and kill whatever isn't a <a href="/npc=62317/minfernal">Minfernal</a>. If nothing has popped in 15-20 mins go back the slaughter. <br />Good hunt!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PoshKenneth</b></h3>I had read a comment on another website that someone had spoken to a GM who encouraged them saying that the more Infernals you kill the more likely it is for a Minfernal to spawn.<br /><br />So I killed Infernals for a few hours and lo and behold, a Minfernal spawned.<br /><br />Just as I clicked it someone else had beat me to it.<br /><br />I wouldn't be so bitter if I didn't feel like killing those Infernals sped up the spawn time and that all the time I spent doing that helped some other guy get a Minfernal.<br /><br />But being as insane as I am I'll keep trying, I just have this crappy feeling that someone else will steal it when it does spawn again...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>154479</b></h3>Got mine, after I started killing the infernal mobs in the area. Maybe it's just coincendence but it gives you something to de while you wait for a spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>896743</b></h3>Minfernals and all other battle pets despawn /die if you attack a person who is capturing it.<br />If you see an opposing faction capturing it let them have it or you are going to waste their time and yours making it so there is an extra person farming the pet, and they will probably repay for for killing their pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1069095</b></h3>If you kill off one of these just because of quality, you are ignorant to the fact of how easy it is to obtain a stone. Stop this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Missdirect</b></h3>I initially found one my first day of looking, it was a rare. I'd recently switched some pets around in my team for the sake of leveling and in my haste to click on him before anyone else I forgot this. Moral of the story, you probably need at least two decent 15's to take on his team, just in case. (I had also forgotten to heal them so that was a factor.) Make sure your team can take him and his two adds. He hits pretty hard. Seeing my last pet die, with his last add around 10% was excruciating.<br /><br />I mourned a couple of days and then went on the hunt for heal. Moving every toon on every server I had that was 45+ to felwood. I would then go down the list checking multiple servers. Making a dk and parking it in felwood on a low population server finally got me my minfernal! And luck beyond luck, when I clicked on him, he was another rare!<br /><br />The best advice I can give someone looking for this pet is to look late at night, on a low population server (I found mine on a role playing server at about 1 o'clock). There was only one other 90 druid looking at the time, he was from a different server.<br /><br />Good luck and happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Entilzha2161</b></h3>Managed to snag one of these without too much direct camping by leaving 2 toons camped there on 2 different Battlegroups, one spawned on an 80DK haven't played in years on Shu'halo (the toon was actually naked as all its heirloom gear was faction transferred), but keeping a toon camped at that spawn point in as many of the CRZ grouping as possible will greatly enhance your chances of finding one in less time, now onto that Scourged Whelpling.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>979234</b></h3>Not sure why I can't reply above post (<b>and the post should get negative votes now and get closed</b>). But logging out also makes the pet disapear now. Not sure what happends if you alt+F4, but guessing the same thing.<br />But joining a battleground (or raid/scenario/dungeon) and leaving it asap still seems to be working.<br /><br />NOTE: Don't go afk for more than 5 minutes. The fight will then finish on it self.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>758107</b></h3>If you are from a high populated server such as me, my best advise (if u have a 50-55lvl toon) is to realm jump. <br /><br />My boyfriend helped me by creating a DK on every low pop realm starting from the top working our way down. I think you need to be same or lower lvl than the one who invts you, and ofc a DK is only lvl55 from start. <br /><br />I solved this by traveling to felwood with my lvl54 monk, the mobs are a bit lower than you, so you can run the circle looking for this guy after each inv without pulling everything around you - your friend needs to stay online till you are done looking, otherwise you will be thrown back to your own realm.<br /><br />I found 2 of these guys within the first 18 realms, took about 10-15min to go through them.

I did this on two different servers although there were others I would pop up on without killing rats. <br /><br />I killed battle pet tainted rats, toads, anything that was in the vicinity of the Minfernals. I also killed the non-combative pets. The first time it helped to spawn a Minfernal within 20 minutes by just sticking to the Scar area. Someone else got that one so I decided to try a different server (not low pop just fewer there at the time) and within another 20 minutes another minfernal popped using the same strategy.<br /><br />I did not kill the larger Infernals. Just the surrounding critters. I also used a macro for quicker killing. Good luck all.</div>

Luckily, as I died I saw where the minfernal had been added to my collection and the one I battled was still there for someone else to get. It was a poor quality but who cares, I got my minfernal and used 1k JP to upgrade it to uncommon. The pali that killed me went to get the minfernal that was still there so I killed it as he landed on it. ^&amp;*!@#bag of me, yes, made me feel better, oh hell yes.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Elethea1</b></h3>So after reading all these comments, and endless killing of fernals, one pops up after I move away from a kill and a person right behind me picked it up before I could turn around and get it. To make matters worse, they followed me around for about 15 mins with the minfernal out just to taunt me. After swearing that I would quit this game for the umpteenth time in seven years, I decided to make toons on other servers. One DK for Brazilian, one for Oceanic, Latin, ect. I choose low population pvp servers hoping that this would give me a better edge. An hour later I log into the Brazilian server to start my rounds of the area. It was 4 server time and Immolatus spawned. I killed him. I ran around some more and killed two more Fernals. Ten mins after I killed the rare spawn a minfernal showed of poor quality. Tamed it! Yeeesssssss!<br />I went to bed and just a few mins ago, just to test the Immolatus theroy I logged into Oceanic and Immolatus just happen to spawn. I killed him. Ran around. Found another minfernal spawn of low quality. Left it. Switched over to Brazilian and found another minfernal of low quality in the same area as the Oceanic one. I left that one for the other toon who was running around to grab. <br /><br />Bottom line try after the Immolatus spawn. <br /><br />Also, for those who are flying over and get CRZ minfernals showing up, you might try making the target minfernal macro and binding your interact with target key. Also make sure you have inflight dismout enabled. I used this when they had zoning issued for the land fall patch in pandaria and I could not get to pets I needed there because I was zoned out from them. They have since fixed the issue, but it did not stop me from getting certian pets when running the line between zones.<br /><br />Edit: Had a person from warcraftpets.com confirm that they got one for themselves and one for their daughter 10 to 15 mins after killing Immolatus. <br /><br />Hope this helps in the search for the elusive minfernal.</div>

No waiting either, as I tend to make it a habit to just go up to Felwood once a day for a minute or so. It was wandering around with a full sized Infernal a fair ways from the craters. I nearly killed it when I started the fight with level 20 pets equipped. Remember to have level 15-17 pets equipped with heading into Felwood. It was only poor quality, but I'll upgrade with my next stone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>268147</b></h3><b>Note: Sadly, this has been patched as of 5.3. Many thanks to all for the appreciative comments. Best of luck to all still searching for this pet.</b><br /><br />***<br /><br />Here's how to make CRZ work for you! <br /><br />You <b>can</b> capture this pet while on the flight path, you just have to take the right path!<br /><br />As several comments have noted, you can often see plenty of Minfernals, Scourged Whelplings, Robo-Cubs, etc. while you're on the flight path/gryphon from one zone to the other. However, upon landing, you will no longer be able to see these spawns, since when you land in Felwood (in this case), you enter the zone on your actual realm, so those spawns you saw as you flew over were CRZ spawns that phased out upon landing.<br /><br />So the trick is to enter combat with them while on the flight path. This <i>is</i> currently possible for pet battles -- simply bind a key to &quot;Interact with Target&quot; and spam that key when you're in range of the spawn you want to battle. <br /><br />I know a few others have tried this, unsuccessfully, on the Minfernal and had been unable to get close enough to the pet. However, <b>I can confirm that it does work, even for Minfernals, you simply have to take the correct flight path.</b> You need a flight that will fly you directly over Shatter Scar Vale and that will take you low enough/close enough to interact with the Minfernals.<br /><br /><ol><li>Start in <b>Mt. Hyjal at the Nordrassil flight path.</b> Hyjal is generally on a different CRZ than Felwood, so once you are in Hyjal you will enter a different zone. This part is important, otherwise you're just flying from path to path within your own realm. This flight path will work for Horde or Alliance characters. (However, if you find after a few attempts that this particular path doesn't work, another option for Horde characters is to fly from <b>Orgrimmar to Whisperwind.</b>) </li><li>Make a targetting macro of your choice. The most basic requirement is:<br /><br />/tar Minfernal<br /><br />but if you like to add in fancy things like sounds, screenshots, and the like, feel free. <br /><br /><i>(However, do note that if you use a whisper mod such as WIM, you may not want to include macro code that will whisper you upon finding the spawn, as I found that these mods can steal focus in your window, such that spamming your &quot;Interact with Target&quot; key ends up typing in the chat box instead.</i>) </li><li>Bind this macro to a key. I like 4. </li><li>Under Esc &gt; Key Bindings &gt; Targeting Functions, bind a separate key to &quot;Interact With Target.&quot; I chose the period key so that I could hit one button with my left hand and the other button with my right hand.</li><li>Now, from Hyjal, <b>take the flight path down to Wildheart Point</b>. When you choose the taxi path at the flight master, you will notice that this flight path includes a directly vertical line from Whisperwind Grove to Wildheart Point. This path is going to fly you right over Shatter Scar Vale but, what's more, the gryphon WILL take you low enough to interact with Minfernal spawns!</li><li>While on the gryphon, wait until you pass through Irontree Woods, then start pressing your targeting macro. As you pass through Shatter Scar Vale if there are other Minfernals up in the CRZs you're flying through, you'll be able to target one. </li><li>Once you have a target acquired, spam the heck out of your &quot;Interact with Target&quot; button. It will require a little bit of luck and may require a few tries, but there are Minfernals walking around that you will be low enough to interact with. </li><li>If you don't get the pet, once you land at Wildheart Point just fly back to Hyjal and try again. Bonus: If you don't already have your Nordrassil Wisp from Hyjal, you can use the same tactic to capture that pet on your return flight.</li></ol><br /><br />I was able to acquire mine using this method at <b>41.06, 42.36</b>. Once I had the target, I just spammed the &quot;Interact with Target&quot; button until I came within range, then I was successfully pulled into the pet battle. <br /><br />Then just complete the pet battle, capture the Minfernal, and once you leave the fight your gryphon ride will continue. You will probably disconnect upon landing at the gryphon, but you've already captured the Minfernal, which you will still own upon login. <br /><br />It took me four flights total back and forth from Hyjal to Wildheart Point to enter into the battle and to get the timing right, but I'm now the proud owner of a poor quality Minfernal (and a Flawless Magic Battle Stone). <br /><br />Best of luck, and happy hunting!<br />Myx</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aerozia</b></h3>honestly, dont listen to ppl here. i have not had any luck killing critters or the infernals. with things like this people go crazy and try to attribute anything and everything to making something spawn, drop or proc.<br />just check in randomly, or wait, its just a really long spawn, i have got 3 by just logging in, and its already there, or as i was flying by it spawned, the whole mob of ppl waiting and flying didnt even notice as i dropped down and snagged it.<br /><br />so really, just check when you can, when you que for dungeons, or bgs, kill stuff if you want for luck, but it really doesnt do anything.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>244088</b></h3>If you want a Minfernal follow MyxomatosisFM genius instructions. I got one on my first run.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sagentine</b></h3>If you are having a problem with this or any other rare companion, create a DK on Ravenholdt or add a person to your Real ID if you don't mind giving it out to a stranger. Ravenholdt is a low populated RPPVP server. If the pets are not up, then at least you have way less competition or you can try again later. So far I haven't had a problem with none being up.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tommytom</b></h3>I want to thank two people, MyxomatosisFM and zarrise.<br /><br />All the information from MyxomatosisFM was amazing and I spent last night over 2 hours trying to get one, but never coming close enough to one lol Sometimes there were like 4 to choose from during the crz flight. I was getting annoyed and even made a dk like someone suggested on a server, but it was full of dks in that area lol<br /><br />I then read zarrise comment about flying from org to Whisperwind and I got one on my first fly by, the first target was too far away, but the second target was right in that flightpath and boom entered battle combat while flying, got a green minfernal and that is good for me as I will most likely just upgrade it with the stone, no point going for another color.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>skitlem</b></h3>its dumb that killing the sentries don't cause them to spawn where in the description of the pet is says that they spawn from larger ones that have fallen. while waiting <b>I found that you can fish in the crater puddles<u></u></b>. you still have to wait but at least this way you can lv up your fishing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>alphasnake</b></h3>After over a month of trying to find this pet, using the taxi/interact method, camping for hours, killing critters all over the area, I finally got one. <br /><br />I started a DK on a low population server, camped it at the spawn point, and just checked on that toon every few hours. I logged in the middle of the afternoon, around 1pm server, and found one a few feet away. Hands trembling, made sure I had the turnip out, clicked it as quick as I could, and finally got my minfernal. Was an uncommon one, but used the Battle stone I'd been saving just for this one pet, and it's now rare. Overall took 2 days from when I started the DK to the tame.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the MyxamatosisFM method is still viable, but this is what worked for me. I just gotta say, keep at it, one of the most frustrating hunts ever, but persistence pays.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Firlox</b></h3>After trying all the pointers listed on here - making new toon on low pop server and logging in now and again (F you campers), flight point /macro interact with target etc. <br /><br />Finally got mine after using the DK i made just for this (lvl 58 Genjuros pvp server). I got a friend on another server (Defias Brotherhood) to inv me to group knowing i would jump to his zone group (as he was the higher level) and see what was on offer in the area of his realm. <br /><br />On porting across there was one just randomly scuttering about, was a grey (who cares!).<br /><br />To summarise - i was able to check 4 diff realms (crz's) on one toon by getting invited by friends in my RL list. Seems a more viable way than any other. I did this first time and it worked....all the others were far too time consuming because i have been trying them for weeks and with no luck.<br /><br />Of course you arent guaranteed to get one just by jumping realms but if you check now and again you might get lucky and at least your adding more ammo to your hunting gun for catching this over camped pet.<br /><br />a quick edit to this... your friend from the 'other' realm doesnt have to be in felwood for you to crz and check the area</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>serahna</b></h3>Got mine tonight. I tried MyxomatosisFM's strategy about 6 times, and every single time, I would get a message saying the target was too far away.<br />I tried several different flight paths, and same result.<br />I am thinking they might have ninja patched it :(<br /><br />BUT I still managed to get one at about 3:18 AM (central real time) on Drak'thul, and it is green quality! *dance*. <br />It was the only one up. <br />Along the way I did run there (from Wildheart Point) and was randomly shooting critters along the way.<br />I did not battle anything, just shot random critters.<br />I am not sure that played any part in it causing one to pop, but thought I would post my experience.<br /><br />Oh and something to remember: I was using a level 25 guardian cub.<br />I used his &quot;roar&quot; ability ONLY. It took 3 hits to put the minfernal in taming range, and no where close to killing it.<br />I have used Guardian Cubs &quot;roar&quot; at level 25 to capture pets as low as level 6.<br />It's a very soft hitting ability, so it makes him very useful for captures if you don't have Terrible Turnip.<br />Good luck with this pet guys.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nemo74</b></h3>I too spent hours getting a DK out of the starting zone. I flew to felwood and over the Scar and seen 1 infernal in the middle. I was to high to interact with it. This was flying from Orgrimmar to Whisperwind. The flight path changes slightly when you fly up from the south Vs. coming in from the north. I am going to try to get someone to take my low lvl dk to Hyjal and fly down. That might make all the difference.<br /><br />Update:<br />No it does not matter, I was at the same height and same path. If there were more spawns in the area this could work. But on the server I was on. It did not.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1087226</b></h3><b>IT DOES EXIST</b><br /><br />I first tried to camp this on my high pop server. Heck. No.<br /><br />Next I tried my low pop alt, but because of CRZ it was also highly camped.<br /><br />Third I try RPPVP DK since it worked so good with FLuxfire Feline. Also heavily camped.<br /><br />Now I discover a 4th char on another server high enough to go. Again highly camped.<br /><br />By this point I am extremely frustrated, especially with CRZ. But I don't give up. I check and camp these 4 servers for a few days off and on. Still haven't even seen one.<br /><br />Now I'm DESPERATE. I am pissed and I want to give up but I NOW REALLY WANT THIS $08 EVEN MORE. I decide to give MyxomatosisFM's flight path hax thing a try. I spend several hours last night and today on all 4 servers still don't even see them on any FPs. <b>I want to confirm that this trick is possible.</b> Although it will depend on if there are any up when you fly over AND there location. I mouse targeted a tainted rat and was able to enter battle from the FP. Anyway still no luck on Mythfernal....<br /><br /> I decide try my last option. Brazilian DK. Ugh. Leveled another DK and went to Felwood. I finally can see some Minfernal from the FP! I check and there is another DK camping and no minfernal so I proceed to waist another hour of my life trying to get one from FP. All I manage to do is target the Minfernal, but he is too far away from the path to enter battle. D@mn. So I have just about given up a resigned to logging into various alts to look.<br /><br /> Last I head over to the fell pools to log out. I am angry at this point and start killing rats and anything else that gets in my way. I look at my map and WTF Minfernal. Needless to say I ran over with my heart pounding in my chest and carefully caught that sucker! <br /><br />I felt bad for the DK he didn't even see it. But I showed him mine to give him some faith that they do exist.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>harlee</b></h3>Has anyone figured out what the spawn timer is on this elusive pet? I finally saw my first one this morning at 4:07am but someone else beat me to it by a fraction of a second.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>798689</b></h3>i don't know if this will help anyone but here ya go. i asked a GM this<br /><br />i am looking for the minfernal.. OK so i am on the server coilfang and my Battlegroup is Retaliation which is made up of a total of 18 different servers. so with the cross realm thing does that mean when i am on a flight path and i see minfernals because it phases and when i personally fly there no minfernals. does that mean that the minfernal is some where on one of those 18 servers? or because of the CRZ does that mean i am seeing the pet on different battlegroups?<br /><br />GM's answer<br /><br />Hey there, thanks for taking time to reach out to us about your question.<br /><br />I can't tell you much about the CRZ or the ceiling ninjas of Blizzard will get me, but I can say its a smaller group than 18, and yes, it might mean it's on another server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Poxic</b></h3>Addons that work for rare mobs via cache detection work for these as well, and can save you from staring endlessly at your minimap while you camp.<br /><br />Install the Silver Dragon addon, then open up its options under the interface section, click on mobs, and then always, and then enter 62317 in the box and hit okay.<br /><br />If/when one spawns around you, a popup will come up and a sound will be played. You can also enable sound in background with the volume up in case you want to use your pc for other things.<br /><br />Amusingly, a minfernal had spawned within seconds of me doing this, and it alerted me to its presence and I ended up grabbing one.<br /><br />Spawn behaviour note: 15 minutes after the one I caught spawned, I returned to my PC and noticed a swarm of paws on my minimap. Somewhere between 15-20 minifernals had spawned en-masse.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>235863</b></h3>If you are trying myx's suggestion to grab the minfernal while flying over, make sure you visit the site at least once when you land.<br /><br />I was trying myxs' flyover approach and wasn't seeing any minfernals so I figured i'd run up there and check it out. Wouldn't you know it, there was one waiting for me in my own zone.<br /><br />So be sure to check the minfernals in your own zone by riding up there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Catitude</b></h3>I just captured a Normal quality at 45.2 38.6 just minutes before Server Shutdown 10 or 15min after killing Immolatus. I also ran around and killed Tainted Rats &amp; battled the few Wild battle pets I found in a rough circle around the spawn area.<br />One of my Guild Mates managed to successfully use the strategy from Myxomatosis flying up from Astranaar &amp; captured an Uncommon this last weekend.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>812941</b></h3>I finally got my Minfernal about 45 minutes ago on Smolderthorn. I am so happy.<br /><br />I tried the Flight Path technique but I could't get it to work for me. After flying over the Minfernal site dozens of times, using both my Horde and Alliance toons and every conceivable flight path variation, I gave up. Even though I could target them, I couldn't get close enough to them to enter battle. <br /><br />What did it take for me to get this pet... I almost don't want to admit what lengths I went to to get my gray (now blue, thanks to a Battle Stone) Minfernal. Suffice it to say that the toon I did catch it with was a level 58 priest I rolled specifically to catch this pet, as I can't play a DK to save my life. And I leveled it up on a PvP server, which was painful too. <br /><br />I had toons parked in Felwood on 5 different servers. I have been logging in and out for weeks, spending hours staring at critters and mobs. <br /><br />What happened finally was... You know that one rat that spawns in the middle of the Minfernal area? Sometimes it's just a critter, sometimes it's a catchable battle rat. Well, I kept killing that rat because I had nothing else to do. When it would respawn, it would always respawn as a rat. <br /><br />Except for the last time. It spawned right in front of me as a Minfernal... I couldn't believe my eyes. Yay!<br /><br />So I guess my advice is to keep killing the critters etc in the area... If you can't get the FP trick to work. Good luck, happy hunting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1060291</b></h3>I followed the advice on some posts here and created DKs in three servers. I would toon hop every now and then to check if they have spawned. On one of my DKs in Gallywix I think I spent around an hour killing the Infernal Sentries but no Minfernal. I hopped on over to my DK in Nagrand and I saw a capturable Tainted Rat on the NW part of the zone where these Minfernals would appear. Out of boredom, I battled the Tainted Rat. Right after the battle I saw another green paw on the minimap. I spammed my target macro button to check if it is a Minfernal and it was! My heart jumped a beat and I ran over to engage the pet in battle. Now I am a very proud owner of a Minfernal!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1089625</b></h3>Sadly, I have been trying for the last week trying to get one, and I have failed every try.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>662743</b></h3>I have 3 of these guys now..2 were uncommon and 1 was poor, but I used a flawless battle stone on 1 of them to have a rare. I must of had better luck then most , just parked a toon out there and checked back once in a while. Got some of mine even when there were other people out there, they just missed them. Ended up giving an uncommon to somebody else, since I had 1 already, by logging out in battle and it worked. They got it! Thought that was cool. My bro went out there 1 time and got a rare. I really hate him...lol. H<br />opefully a patch soon will make the wild pets sellable. I'm still not sure why these are so popular. They are not incredible at 25 and I never see anyone battling with them. Hmmm</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Matthat15</b></h3>Ok, I have now captured two minfernals Legitimately, not using flight path tricks, One common and one uncommon, So I thought I'd share my tactic and some info about it, I can confirm that there can only be a certain amount of battle pets (If they'll battle or not it doesn't matter) in the Shatter scar vale, So, My tactic was, I would kill all the critters (like tainted rat) in the vale and would then wait, perhaps talk in guild chat while I camp for a while, then, if no minfernals spawned and all tainted rats spawned again, I would kill them all then repeat, I did this about three times before I acquired my first, then once for my second, there is no point in camping there hoping for one to show up if there is no room for them to spawn anyway, you should be killing the tainted rats so there is room for them to spawn, Anyway, this is how I got my lovely minfernals that I shall cherish, Happy hunting all, Hope you get yours soon! :)<br /><br />P.S: Why downvote me, I'm trying to help others get it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kespec</b></h3>You have probably heard about manipulating the CRZ feature to get this pet, but still may be out of luck. the reason is many other people are actually doing the taxi trick.<br /><br />best way to get the pet with the trick is; look for a low population server, create a horde death knight. finish the quest you will be eventually sent to orgrimmar. report to the warchief then immediately go to the flight master. with /tar minfernal macro and and interact with target keybinding ready take a flight to whisperwind grove.<br /><br />if done correctly you will probably fly right over one, do the trick get the minfernal.<br /><br />additional info<br /><br />level range is 13-15 , has 2 companions assisting, 500-600 hp. has abilities deal extra damage to; mecha, flying, dragon. those abilities deal lower damage to critters and beasts.<br /><br />good luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maritas</b></h3>MyxomatosisFM - you are the awesome.<br />Thank you. I've been hunting this blasted pet for ages on a high pop server and never even seen one spawn. I went to another server, created a death knight and was able to follow your instructions to the T! It took a few days for there to be one on the flight path close enough to snag it but then I got lucky. You'll get Dc'd shortly after and before I got too happy, I logged back in to make sure it was there and BooYaa!<br /><br />Oh and I had to add - I wouldn't have had to do the whole flight thing - HAD the idiot not snagged the one that spawned and then wasted it - he was looking for a rare. O_o Use a stone you moron! It's jerks like that who keep the rest of us from getting one.<br /><br />It stinks when you have to resort to getting pets this way but if it works, it works.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1093651</b></h3>okay so i've tried everything and i was losing my mind. finally, today at around 1:00am i decided to fly back and check it out. took the flight path from org. i saw one minfernal spawned on the mini map and thought that it was probably more crz nonsense. i then mounted up once i landed and headed to check it out. i saw two people camped in the middle of the zone so i figured that nothing was there. decided to check where i saw it on the minimap and saw a green paw on the map. after all of my camping i figured that it was a tainted rat, but it was actually a minfernal! engaged it and caught my minfernal finally! it was common quality but i had four stones in my bags so who cares? then i called my brother in law to gloat only to have him log in and snag a minfernal only minutes after me lol. so for anybody who's looking and has just about lost their minds in the process: don't waste your time camping. fly over every now and again and you'll find one eventually. you won't go as insane that way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>735501</b></h3>I just had to chime in on this, I got SO lucky just now! I have only been out here for about 10 minutes (don't hate!), and while tabbed out reading these comments I noticed a paw show up on the mini map. HOLY CRAP. There it is! I frantically started trying to engage battle, received an error (aggghhh wth) and finally got it to start. He only had one other pet with him, himself being of Green quality! My Snowy Owl did perfect against him and now he's mine! I found him behind a big tree just off the road at 41.53x38.50!<br /> After capturing him, I flew around and noticed that Immolatus had also spawned, but no other mini's to be found. Maybe there is a link to the spawn time with the Rare? Anyway, I really, really thought I would NOT be seeing one of these for a very long time. The dang baby giraffe took so long to find compared to this guy. lol There were multiple people out here also, I'm so happy it spawned next to me.<br />Good luck to everyone, I hope you find a trick that works, or just that luck shines on you. :)<br />-Galasriniel, Whisperwind</div>

Yesterday, I saw someone grab one around 5:15pm. Both were seen up around the big guy (Kroshius?) that has a quest symbol. I've been flying around, either killing or fighting the tainted rats to encourage new spawns. All I need now is to wait for the QIraji Guardling and its mysterious start date to complete my Safari achievements! Good luck everyone :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>795337</b></h3>Had to make a DK on a PVP server in order to catch mine, my home base was just over run with people trying to catch one.<br />Got 2 of them at around 11:30am server time (US) the first was grey and I critted and killed his scrawny butt. I had waited for about 4 hours for one to spawn and thought that I was going to be in for another long wait when I noticed another paw print and much to my delight it was another minfernal. Caught that one, it was only a common but I have a battle stone set aside for him already.<br /><br />Good Luck people, and if you're on a busy server take others suggestions and try making a DK on another low pop server, worked for me and one of my guildies who got his first and suggested I try it.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sandybeach16</b></h3>After trying to get this pet on several servers and several characters, I used chipper2279's advice and it worked. 9:50pm server time was when I killed several infernal sentrys and came back tonight a little early tonight (9:30pm server time) and killed several more infernals and critters to pass the time.<br /><br />FINALLY a minfernal spawned! Right around 9:50pm server time was when I finished the battle and it was mine. Special thanks to <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=85220">Terrible Turnip</a> for not killing the thing.<br /><br />I don't even care that the minfernal I captured is of poor quality. I have one!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1104463</b></h3>Got it today the old fashioned way. I was trying to do the flight path trick, noticed several Minfernals, but wasn't successful in battling one. On the return flight path I noticed a lone Minfernal. Once I landed I immediately flew back and got it.<br /><br />I didn't care to try the flight path trick afterwards, but I'm guessing it would have worked. Earlier I posted that I thought Blizzard fixed it because I saw zero Minfernals on several flights from two different realms (flew from Orgimmar on my PvP Horde toon, flew from Darkshore on my PvE Alliance toon). This morning I saw at least five or six Minfernals, and it looked like two were close enough to the flightpath to be grabbed. Moreover, I can confirm that pet battles can still be initiated from flight paths (I tried with Tainted Rats). If Blizzard wanted to fix this, I'm guessing they would have just prevented initiating pet battles from flight paths rather than modify the Minfernal's zone to keep them out of range.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ammonite</b></h3>I decided to test the theory that killing the infernal sentries causes the minfernals to respawn starting about 23.5 hours later as I tried to get my own pet, and while I was at it, I tried to put some more specific numbers to it by keeping track of how many I killed and how many minfernals spawned. The first night, I hadn't decided to keep track, but I killed around 40-50 based on my recollection of the vendor trash I accumulated. Nothing spawned, so I tried again the next night, killing ~120 infernal sentries over the course of about 40 minutes (though I'm sure it would have gone faster if I had been more concentrated). Again, after showing up 23.5 hours after I started and staying about 1.5 hours, nothing spawned. I again killed just over 100 sentries last night in another attempt to cause minfernals to spawn for tonight. I got lucky enough to grab a common minfernal during the day and upgrade it with a battle stone. I checked in tonight to see if anything spawned anyway to fulfill my curiosity about this method, and again, nothing was spawned. There are a number of contradictory anecdotes, but based on my experience, either I had very bad luck with RNG, a much larger number of infernal sentries need to be killed to have a good chance with minfernal spawns, or the people who have had success with this method have simply gotten lucky with timing. I really can't say what is correct, but I thought I would at least share my data.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>847801</b></h3>I need some help with the flight path technique. Are there always spawns up when you fly past?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ilikepancakes</b></h3>I'm not sure whether I was just lucky, but I'd tried the flightpath trick, just killing critters, killing infernals and just camping around the area and wasn't getting any love.<br /><br />So I thought I'd try killing infernals and coming back 23hrs later. So, spent about 10minutes killing inferals yesterday (not sure how many...mostly just til I got bored) and then came back 23 1/2hrs later, and within about 10minutes there she blew!<br /><br />Caught at 5:59am Saturday on Thunderlord, green quality!<br /><br />So, again, whether this truly works or not, I'm not sure, but it worked for me, so good luck for anyone else who tries this method!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>239561</b></h3>I have been camping the spawn sites for weeks on 2 realms without any luck. I decided to try and attempt the 'flightpath method' and whilst I did see Minfernals and was successful in targeting them, I was unable to engage from the air. I received the message that I was out of range of my target. I used a macro for targeting and changed key bindings to interact with the target (in my case to 2). I flew right over one Minfernal - I don't know that there could have been any closer to the fp so I'm starting to think that maybe this has been patched for 5.2. Has anyone caught a pet from flying since 5.2?<br /><br />What I did realise was that on my second realm, because only one Minfernal appeared on the map whilst I was flying, I could tell that my realm was actually a host realm (Jubei) and so as soon as I landed, I raced back and caught myself the one uncommon Minfernal that had spawned. Still in the area an hour later and none others have spawned.<br /><br />If like me, you would prefer not to create a DK solely to catch pets on low pop non CRZ, you really do need to put in a lot of time and still, be extremely lucky to catch a Minfernal. Good luck! I for one am just looking forward to not having to spend so much time in Felwood; it really is the middle of nowhere...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ghcpa999</b></h3>I got mine yesterday, albeit poor quality but who cares! At 1:45 am on an PRPVP server I saw three or four on the minimap while flying over shatter scar vale en route to Winterspring. I turned around at the flight path in winterspring and by the time I landed in Felwood they were gone. I checked a few more times during the day. I logged back on at 5pm same day and one was there and I got him. He was 'grouped' with a tainted moth. This confirms as others have said, the respawn timer can be several hours to a full day. Hope this helps!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1106198</b></h3>Got a rare one of these today. I camped for a few days on a flying mount over the middle of the 5 dots in the vale where they spawn and logged in every once in awhile to see if there were any. Tonight, I didn't see any paws on the minimap when I logged in, but decided to fly around the outer edge of the vale just in case, and there was a rare on the outer edge of the upper left dot! Tough fight, but I managed to get him with a team of three rare mechanicals, all level 16-17. If you've been logging on in the vale and giving up before you fly around a little to double check, you may have missed some opportunities, so take a few seconds and you might get lucky like I did.</div>

Same with the Scourged Whelpling, just loads of cross-realmers camping the area. 5:55pm, server time, I was bored and browsing my UI when I saw one appear on the minimap. Without closing anything down, I flew in the direction of it rather clumsily, terrified that someone would get to it before me. Hit the ground, commenced battle. Poor, captured, happy.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1012488</b></h3>You can make a minfernal spawn in the Vale by flying slowly overhead at random times. I know this because it worked on my 67th attempt over several weeks.<br />Now for a word about the Minfernal as a Battle Pet:<br />It's Meteor Strike ability does do a fair chunk of damage but also has a high chance of missing when used against an opponent more than two levels over your Minfernal.<br />As for it's Explode ability - I was in the Valley of Four Winds the other night with my then-level 21 stone-upgraded pet, things are going well and it's just a bar-and-a-half from hitting 22 when I notice this shiny red button. &quot;Hmmm, I wonder what this does?&quot;<br /><br />Oops...<br /><br />Suffice it to say this ability is best avoided unless:<br />1. Lil' Mr. Fernal is already maxxed out and no longer needs the XP or<br />2. You feel that taking out your opponent in such a spectacular fashion is worth the sacrifice for the good of the team.<br />Happy camping yall!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>324969</b></h3>I can confirm that targeting Minfernal from a flightpath still works. I just got a common one flying from Org into Whisperwind Grove. I had tried from Hellscreams Watch 5-6 times but couldn't hook up. Tried from Nordrassil and Moonglade into Wildheart Point but that didn't work either. Going from Org worked the first time. (Your mileage may vary) I made a macro:<br />/clear target<br />/target Minfernal<br />and bound it to #1 key and bound &quot;interact with target&quot; to #2 key. As you fly over the spawn area, spam #1 until you see a target in front of you and hit #2 and the battle will start if its close enough. After the battle, I was in Whisperwind and after a few minutes was disconnected but the Minfernal was still mine. Good luck all.<br /><br />UPDATE: Looks like Blizz stopped this little trick. I tried the last three days and every time I was in range of a Minfernal, I got a message saying, &quot;Pet battle already in progress.&quot; It sure was fun while it lasted.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>aslaja</b></h3>I just made an interesting observation. Every time I went to look for a Minfernal, there were no battle pets marked as available for battle in the area. Today however there were several Tainted rats around the craters. I thought I might at least level up one of my lower level pets so I killed a few of them and there he was, a Minfernal! He spawned in place of one of the rats.<br />It might have been a coincidence but anyway I suggest to give it a shot if something like that happens to you.<br /><br />PS: My Minfernal was a poor quality and he came together with a rare Beetle. You can imagine the disappointment. Glad I chose the poor Minfernal as there were no more spawning after that. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1018034</b></h3>I have been searching for this pet for weeks now checking an alt camped in the area. Found one today on US Boulderfist at 2:22 AM server time early Tuesday morning before the downtime. I went to check one last time before logging, saw nothing except a Tainted Rat located at 39, 42. Out of desperation I started a pet battle with it, 2 secondary Tainted Rats popped up and i surrendered. Then out of frustration I moonfired the rat and to my surprise a Minfernal popped up next to me at 40, 42. Not saying to farm the rats, but confirming this is what happened for me. Just thought anything I could do to help people with this as it can get pretty hopeless feeling after a while :/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ravenz79</b></h3>Best advice - caught mine today<br />Make a macro / tar minfernal and also go to your hot key in game interface and hot key 'interact with target.'.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>978011</b></h3>I would like to add that this pet is a great tank overall and that it is great for battling mechanicals.<br />The <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=243">magic - type passive</a> makes them ideal for battling mechanicals because they can avoid taking lots of damage from abilities like <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=459">Wind-Up</a> or <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=208">supercharged</a> abilities.<br /><br />This pet has a great combination of offensive and defensive abilities.<br />I typically use <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=178">Immolate</a> -- <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=409">Immolation</a> -- <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=407">Meteor Strike</a> ability set, because you have great DoTs and can avoid hard-hitting abilities.<br />Being a magic pet means that using <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=282">Explode</a> is a lot safer,due to magic type passive (see above).<br /><br />The only ability that doesn't cope well with the others is <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=406">Crush</a>, as most (if not all) Dragon pets have at least Dragon - type ability which does extra damage to magic pets.<br /><b>However</b>, i have tested this pet against Dragon pets with the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=406">Crush</a> -- <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=392">Extra Plating</a> -- <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=407">Meteor Strike</a> / <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=282">Explode</a> ability set (both Meteor Strike and explode work well in this situation depending on your strategy) and the Minfernal was more than capable of beating several Dragon pets.<br /><br />Now about the desirable breeds,I really don't know which one is the best (personally my Minfernal is a 45% hp / 45% damage breed,and it works just fine). But , I believe that 45%/45% breeds and possibly the 100% hp breed perform better than the 20%/45%/20% and the 25%/25%/25% breeds.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TevishSzat</b></h3>Hunt out the Minfernal because itâ€™s cool, not because itâ€™s effective. Like most battle pets, it has the potential to be useful, but if tiers form Iâ€™d be mighty surprised to see it in the upper half. Its first move, Crush or Immolate, is a choice between (Humanoid) damage now or (Elemental) damage over time while its second move is a choice between a long duration but small DoT and a defensive ability that you canâ€™t maintain like Shell Shield and its ilk. The third move is no choice at all: Meteor Strike is a 2-turn move like Burrow or Lift-Off where the target is immune between beginning to execute. Explode, on the other hand, is blatantly suicidal: though admittedly it is for very heavy damage, itâ€™s at best used for pure spite. Iâ€™d say the best move-set is either of the first abilities, Immolation, and Meteor Strike. Using Immolate with the Immolation is less damage in the immediate, but more ticking damage while youâ€™re executing Meteor strike. Admittedly, taking Crush gives it three different forms of damage, but I doubt even that makes the minfernal really great.<br /><br />Itâ€™s really a pity that this thing is lackluster, because itâ€™s one of the coolest small pets in the game.<br /><br />It does, at least, have a lot of breed options, though</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Baelrah</b></h3>Made a DK on a low pop RP-PVP realm, leveled through the starting area and now I can battle 2-3 minfernals each day to check for green/blues. Easy, not time consuming (except the 1-2 hour DK starting area), and no hassle with endless camping or macro's on flightpaths. Tried that about 10 times, but the flightpath was zig-zagging through the minfernals that were up, unable to reach them. If you really want one, go DK and look for a rare each day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Puresthoof</b></h3>I cannot believe it! I actually caught one of these today and I am so excited I created a wowhead account so I could tell people and submit a screenshot! lol <br /><br />After about eight months of having a lower level camped there and randomly logging on a couple of times a day, I finally found one! The adrenalin kicked in and I could not hear anything due to the blood rushing to my head! lol<br /><br />So I believe you just need to be patient and also make sure you have at least 1 pet in your lineup that is over level 15! <br /><br />Also thank you all who have posted their experiences catching any battle pet as it has helped me on my pet journey! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cowina</b></h3>Got one today! And it is green! I was camping it and picking herbs, battling tainted rats, etc. I decided to kill everything in the area as some have suggested. It seems to have worked. 10 minutes or so in my Minfernal showed up. After capturing it another spawned. I alerted a fellow camper who got theirs as well. Thanks for all the helpful posts. Good luck hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ronfed</b></h3>I captured my Minfernal today after three months of trying. It was the second one I've seen in three months, the first was just a week ago, but I was so excited that time I lost it to another player. This time he popped up right in front of me as soon as I entered the game. I'll pass along some of what I've learned that I hope will be of use to you. <br /><br />I succeeded using some of the tips others have posted, namely the /tar macro and having a flying alt live there and check in with it several times a day. I found that a mining alt made this a little less tedious plus made some gold selling the Mithril on the AH. <br /><br />Using several of the flight paths posted here does indeed let you see Minfernals on other realms, but I found it impossible to get close enough to interact with them even though targeting them was easy. In addition, when I tried this on my own mount, using another combat pet, to get an idea of how close you have to be to interact with one; I found that you CANNOT interact with a pet while flying! You get a message that says &quot;you must be standing to interact with that pet&quot;. (As in other cases, Bliz just means not in the air - mounted on the ground is ok). Perhaps this is a new change, but to me it makes the whole cross realm flying thing useless.<br /><br />The CRZ (cross realm zones) do make this much more difficult. I don't know the exact number, but I've seen players from about fifteen realms all competing with each other for the Minfernal, <br /><br />I used a lvl 17 Flayer Youngling to battle Minfernal, this worked fine, but if I had it to do over a lvl16 pet would be safer (you don't want to accidentally kill him). You can always switch to a higher lvl during capture if necessary.<br /><br />The suggestion to use NPCSCAN is flat out wrong, because Minfernal is automatically added to your creature cache (along with surprise, surprise, Giraffe Calf &amp; Qiraji Guardling) and cannot be detected by NPCSCAN.<br /><br />Gave in to my curiosity and created a DK on a low pop server; this is what I learned:<br /><br />The only true low pop servers are the RPPVP ones. Tried several others including ones marked for new players and non-US servers. Ebon Hold was crowded on these &amp; I received continuous guild invites. On the RPPVP server I was alone most of the time.<br /><br />I decided to send a little extra effort to get the XP &amp; gold for flying in Kalimdor. Glad I did, not only was the searching easier, but there were enough high lvl enemy players around to ensure that I would have spent a lot of time dead.<br /><br />Results: Two minfernals day one, one on day two &amp; one a week later; a definite improvement, but no panacea! You still have to deal with the erratic spawn time of the minfernal and the occasional competing player from your own realm. NOTE: I said &quot;occasional competing player&quot;, not the swarm hovering from a dozen different realms that you encounter in a CRZ. <br /><br />If I think of anything else that might be helpful, I'll edit this post. Good luck to you all.<br /><br />Edited 5/20/13 to add info on DK - Low Pop server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>f6f5hellcat</b></h3>I really hate this pet been trying since the battle pets came out and still no minfernal. I really hate the CRZs as they have made thing like this extreamly hard to do. I will keep trying the flight path trick but I am not going to make a toon on another realm just to get this pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kedrin</b></h3>I got very lucky. It was ten minutes before a rolling restart, the wind was gusting, and there was the smell of sulfur in the air as I swooped into Felwood. And there in shatter scar vale at the northeast point was the minfernal, but it was &quot;in use&quot; with a Tauren druid. At first I felt despondent, but noticed that the infernal would start to walk again. This druid was &quot;reserving&quot; or &quot;holding&quot; the infernal for another player. Minutes past and I was unable to initiate a battle, but the fact that I was still able to click on it was promising. Finally, with 3 and a half minutes left until the rolling restart (the end of the world cometh) a blood elf approached. I clicked like a madman, I clicked for all it was worth, I clicked like it was 1999. And then the battle initiated. The minfernal was mine! If only it would rain on Jaguero Isle then my joy could be complete.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>873189</b></h3>After finally getting this guy after 6 months, on 2 characters in one day, I'd like to share something that may or may not help you all.<br />I was hovering over (40.20, 40.30) and I noticed every 5-60 minutes a Tainted Rat would spawn under me. Quickly killing it to try and free up a spawn for the Minfernal, I noticed the rat would always spawn there. Being curious, I quickly killed every one I saw until- POP! A Minfernal spawned instead of the rat. <br />After jumping for joy for a good 40 minutes, I logged onto an alt that was camped there on another server in an attempt to possibly get the 3/3 allowed. I did the same thing, waited for the spawn at the same coordinates, and within 5 hours had a Minfernal spawn.<br /><br />I don't know if it was just luck, or I may have caught onto something, but I figured I'd put it out there for others to test. Good luck! Now onto that damn Baby Ape...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Droner</b></h3><s>Can anyone confirm what works and what doesn't in 5.3? It's very possible nothing has changed but I've tried all of these methods for a couple weeks now and have squat to show for it. I'm not close to giving up but I'd like to know if I'm wasting my time or not. Much obliged in advance. :D</s><br /><br />EDIT: After some research and testing I got my Minfernal and determined that some combination of killing the tainted rats and slaughtering the infernals got this thing to spawn. I guess I made my own 5.3 confirmation, good luck to those still farming this guy!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rj23</b></h3>If you are pet collector you will appreciate this, but probably hate me for it. In my quest to capture rare pets a friend of mine began casing Jaguero Isle waiting for rain. We were in separate realms. She left a toon here and I left a toon here. Periodically we would check in and over the course of a couple of weeks she caught hers and I was offline :( We both kept a toon in hopes of rain. Finally the rain came! Not only did I catch my Baby Ape, but I caught a rare before the rain stopped.<br /><br />Earlier she and I discussed some strategies for catching the Minifernal. I said, let me just go see if there is one there now. So I flew to Felwood. There were two in the area! I caught one that was uncommon. The other was poor, but it was still a Minifernal! So I cross realmed party with her and she caught it. To be clear there were none in her realm and she crossed to mine to catch it.<br /><br />With this streak going I decided to look and see if there was a sand storm brewing in Tanaris. There wasn't in my realm, but in my friends realm there was. So we partied again and I crossed into her realm. I was able to catch a rare Silithid Hatchling. From beginning to end it took less than an hour. I am a very unlucky person, but i have to say this was some serious luck! I still cannot believe this happened!<br /><br />If someone can teach me how to link in WoWhead I will go back and amend this story with links to each pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>erSch</b></h3>The CRZ flight path trick does not seem to work any more in 5.3. I just flew a flight path, on which I successfully could start a pet battle in 5.2. I was directly over the minfernal and only a couple of feet over his head and it just said, that a pet battle was already active. The same happend with a rat later. I think Blizzard fixed it.<br />Can anyone confirm this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>hillerious</b></h3>Haha this is so damn insane guys, i just went there and i waited max 1 min and then i spotted my minfernal. Happy as i was knowing i would catch it and then use my battlestone on it to upgrade i realised the minfernal itself already was a rare and knowing i could use my battlestone on a Jade owl instead. This made my entire day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1127206</b></h3>The Flyby technique of spamming a &quot;/target minfernal&quot; macro and an &quot;Interact with Target&quot; keybind no longer works. You get a message about not pet battling on a transport.<br /><br />However, the good old fashioned &quot;Kill things until it spawns&quot; seemed to work. But perhaps I just got lucky. <br /><br />I went there the other day to start the farm. One was up. Fought it. Got spanked because I forgot to adjust my team (yes, I'm scrub). So I lost. Went out and started spamming murder on Tainted rats and Frogs and everything else I could find. Went back. Minfernal up in the same place. Fought it. Caught it. Went out and spammed more bloody murder on pets. Came back. Another Minfernal up. There was a level 90 night elf nearby though, so I killed it rather than let it fall into the wrong hands.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>decembre</b></h3>This has been mentioned before, but will mention it again in hopes it will help desperate pet seekers:<br /><br /><b>Make a DK on an RPPVP realm and leave them in Felwood.</b><br /><br />Apparently these servers are not CRZ and have low populations.<br /><br />After a few months of trying various strategies, a friend and I rolled two DKs and hustled them out to Felwood. We both logged on various times checking, and within a week had both found our minfernals.<br /><br />Roll one on a server that is predominantly your faction. If you start getting ganked, save yourself the stress and just log off for the night.<br /><br />Complete your meta! Hope this helps!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wheeljack</b></h3>went to Felwood for Archeology. While I was there, I figured I'd look for the Minfernal too. No Battle-Pet spawns of any kind in the area. I went to these boards to look for tips, spawn-times etc to see whether or not it only spawned under certain conditions etc... <br /><br />I don't know if this is pure coincidence or not, but after reading abit here, I decided to run around killing critters that spawned. Maybe they are place-holders for the battlepets or whatever, but after killing about 7-8 of them, the Minfernal spawned up on one of the ridges there, right next to a tree. It had only 550 HP and me not having swapped any of my lvl25 pets I was afraid I'd kill it. Luckily I didn't. Got it caged, uncommon quality. <br /><br />Not sure if it helps or not, but try to run around abit, look for critters (Tainted Rats) and kill them. Maybe you get as lucky as I did.</div>

Kept doing this every 3 mins or so then about 20mins later or so a Minfernal spawned. Battled a poor (of course) and captured it, did a little dance (wife called me a dork), upgraded to an uncommon then parked my DK in Silithus for the summer Qiraji Guardling!<br /><br />FYI....no one else was there while i was there and this was the first day of summer so im guessing everyone was camping the Qiraji Guardling<br /><br />GL all</div>

So example I roamed around killing every rat I can see, I'd leave that place and do battle pets on other areas, mixing different pets. Example I'd go to Jaedanar and battle a moth, toad, cockroach, etc<br /><br />Go back again to shatter scar to check, kill rats.<br /><br />Go outside again and battle pets, rinse repeat..my minfernal spawned at 8:45 PM pacific time (peak time) on cho'gall US Horde.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1069868</b></h3>Got mine (uncommon) on 7/1 at around noon server time on Mannoroth at coords 38,69. It was the only one there and nobody else was around. I got it just randomly checking a toon I had parked there. First one I've ever even seen! Was starting to believe they didn't exist then I log in and see the little bastard stomping around.<br /><br />For the past few weeks I've tried camping the area for hours, killing rats and battle pets in the area, and I also made a DK on gallywix. None of those worked and were VERY frustrating. I'd recommend just getting as many alts as you can parked there and randomly checking in.</div>

It was only a Common but I couldn't care less.<br />I flew down from Mount Hyjal on mount straight down to the area and ONE was there, was able to catch him right then and there, went off after that and caught the Guardling as I posted on that part of site. I did try the strategy stated about flying from Mount Hyjal fp to one in Fellwood and I did see them but continuously got shifted out of the realm before I got even close to them so I tried the way I mentioned before, at first there was nothing there but suddenly he appeared so yeah.<br /><br />Goodluck guys.<br />-Deathknight.</div>

I don't know if the following helped, but I created a simple macro: <br /><br />/tar tainted<br />/cast Judgment<br />/tar minfernal<br /><br />I busted the chops of every tainted rat &amp; moth in the area, and they're hard to see.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dramfiolz</b></h3>Making a DK on the Ravenholdt-US server worked perfectly for me. It's not only RPPVP, it's also the only RPPVP server in its datacenter, so there are no other servers that are able to CRZ with it (as the CRZ groupings consist of all the servers of the same type in the same datacenter). The server itself seems pretty quiet. When I finished making my DK around 1am on a weeknight there were no players in Felwood at all. It was kind of strange being in the Minfernal spot completely by myself.<br /><br />I waited around for a while and then decided to go to bed. The next morning I logged back in to check, and there was a Minfernal right in front of me. Still no other players present. As soon as I caught it, the server restart message went out, so this was not following a restart.<br /><br />The roughly hour and a half it takes to make a DK and get out to Felwood is nothing compared to how long you might be waiting if you decide to camp the pet on a heavily CRZ'd server. I highly recommend this method.<br /><br />ETA: The same morning I found an Unborn Val'kyr on Ravenholdt with no trouble at all. Just zepped my fresh DK to Northrend, flew to Dal, and ported down. There was one waiting for me. Still no sign of any players.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>naet17</b></h3>Been checking round Felwood for a little while now, trying to glimpse any <a href="/npc=62317/minfernal">Minfernal</a> on Dragonblight and Darkspear servers with no avail, only having that usual heart skip when you see a green paw on your mini map for it to be just a Tainted Rat!<br /><br />Then, just before logging over to another character to do some low lvl raid runs for other battlepets, i decide to hop over and have a look with my mage to see if any are about.<br /><br />To my utter astonishment, i see a green paw on my mini map and for once it is a <a href="/npc=62317/minfernal">Minfernal</a>!<br />So i land my flying mount as soon as humanly possible and jump into a fight with the elusive magical creature, prepared to take whatever rarity it happens to be and be grateful for it. <br />This isnt one of those stories where it turns out to be a rare version, but the one i pounced on was common, and i was happy with that, even though i had no stones at that particular time.<br />So i capture the creature with no problems, and then kill the uncommon tainted cockroach that accompanied it.<br /><br />Then, to even greater astonishment, after the fight i see that i have not been rewarded with my usual 2-5x Lesser Charms of Good Fortune, but with a <a href="/item=92678/flawless-magic-battle-stone">Flawless Magic Battle-Stone</a>!<br /><br />Hows that for sheer dumb luck! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shypull</b></h3>Minfernal - how to - First if your just siting there for it to respwan good luck, <br />1. info - Minfernal is a &quot;Rare Respawn&quot; not a rare spawn time , meaning its a chance of it spawning in the area after a battle pet has been defeated or killed.<br />2. go around in the area of Shatter Scar Vale in side felwood ( this is were minfernal spawns) look for minfernal and kill any battle pets in this zone that are not minfernal (This will give more of a chance battle pets will spawn here)<br />3. go around killing battle pet in felwwod (all over) to lower the respawn time , you also need to kill diff types of battle pets, if you only kill frogs there will be a higher chance on just frogs respawning.<br />4. after about 20min of doing this head back to Shatter Scar Vale and camp for about 5 min<br /><br />in 3hrs 6 Respawned Minfernal</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>prozacmilkshake</b></h3>Okay I HAD to make an account to help you guys out.<br /><br />I've been trying to get this little dude for months now, like a few months.<br />I would sit and camp the spot for hours and hours and hours.<br /><br />I decided to try something new, I made a DK on a very low populated PVP realm in a different battlegroup. <br /><br />When I first got to the spawn point there were none so I gave up and tried for the baby ape. Well I decided to log on and BOOM there was my Minfernal, the first day I made the DK and I got it.<br /><br />Keep your heads up!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Auryan</b></h3>My solution was rolling a DK on a low pop Oceanic realm (I'm Eastern Seaboard USA) and parking him in Felwood. Over there it's like 3 or 4 am when I'm having lunch, so the odds of having a bunch of people in the zone are greatly reduced. Sure enough, after a couple of hours riding around killing everything that moved (even non battle pet critters), a minfernal popped up. Grey quality but I didn't care, just wanted the pet. Good luck in your hunt!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xapcadian</b></h3>Hey guys,<br /><br />I caught my minfernal in about 20 minutes. No tricks. Nothing fancy. Here's what I did.<br /><br />Cruise around Shattered Scar Vale only killing all the rats you see. You're not looking for battle pets, just regular critter rats. I would say that I killed maybe 40 or 50 before a Minfernal popped. Admittedly it's an uncommon, but I have one.<br /><br />Clearing the critters does prompt the battle pet 'Minfernal' to spawn. <br /><br />Happy hunting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Anouk199</b></h3>Camped this for 2 months then took the advice &quot;kill all the other critters and battle pets&quot;. Ran around, AE'd about 10 other battle pets and critters, came back...and there was my minfernal (uncommon). Kill the other battle pets!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1139498</b></h3>I camped and camped and camped and finally just starting killing everything out of pure frustration. About 30-45 minutes of killing everything in the area that moved not just one but TWO minfernals spawned. I caught one and left the other for someone else. Do yourself a favor and kill things, pretty sure it forces it to spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Alekeymon</b></h3>To add in my 2 cents:<br /><br />I followed the advice, killed all the tainted rats (critters) I saw. I saw one battle pet tainted rat--killed that too. Nothing. Granted it was a half-hearted attempt while I was questing and I thought I'd have to do some camping and hope for the best.<br /><br />I went back to questing and got stuck--literally between a rock and a hard place. I couldn't get out. I hearthed to Org and flew back to Whisperwind Grove. On the way, I moused over the battle pets and saw a Minfernal. As soon as I landed, I raced back to Shatter Scar Vale. I found one, battled, and captured. It was a poor quality but I also received a magic flawless battle stone, so I used it on him.<br /><br />I got mine on a level 51 hunter at 15:49 MDT on the Hyjal server. I hope this helps</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>blamlock</b></h3>A note about this pet's <b>very powerful leveling </b>ability <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=282">Explode</a> (which it currently <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=282#used-by">shares </a>with one other Magic pet and three Mechanical pets):<br /><br />If you use a max level Minfernal as a front pet, all the way through a wild pet battle, and successfully <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=282">Explode</a> and kill the last pet of the opposing team, you <b>can avoid swapping your very low-level pets in for one round </b>(and the associated risks).<br /><br />Your two back line pets will <u>share the XP </u>between them without ever seeing battle.<br /><br />That said, the mechanical pets that have this ability tend to have basic attacks more suited to PVE encounters than the Minfernal.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cmacord</b></h3>I have a B/B Minfernal, but I would prefer a H/H, so I sortied back out to Felwood to try my luck. The *second* I hit the Vale, my alarm went off, and I looked down and found myself on top of a Minfernal. I immediately bailed and clicked on him - it was a H/P, which is a good deal better than my B/B, so I captured him. I released my B/B, and will continue to hunt for a H/H until I find one or get bored....<br /><br />It was around 0150 ST on WRA server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1054018</b></h3>After getting my Minfernal today, I thought I would add to the posts here.<br /><br />My advice about farming this battle pet:<br /><br />Since this is a highly sought-after pet, you will be competing with a plethora of people that want to catch this pet as much as (or more than) you do. Log in to farm at a time where most people are asleep.<br />I have read so many strategies about farming, and the argument I seem to hear often is that this pet (despite what it's cute little icon describes) does NOT spawn when you kill their taller brethren (the Infernal Sentries). So your best bet to make sure one way or another: Kill everything. I killed Entropic Horrors, Infernal Sentries, Tainted Rats, and anything else that got in my way. <br /><br />I logged in at 4:33am. I captured my Minfernal at 4:59am. I killed everything, and was making complete circles around all 5 craters. I was edging around the northern-most crater when I noticed the green paw after killing an Entropic Horror. <br />I believe that the text refers to the fact that when the Minfernal spawns, it does so in the ruins of it's larger counterpart... After I killed the Entropic Horror, that is exactly where it was standing. That's why I think you need to kill everything... Killing the Infernal Sentries may not trigger the spawn, but it needs a dead one to build itself when the spawn is triggered...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1143292</b></h3>I have just found 3 of these on a low populated server, <i>all up at once</i>!<br />Considering the heavy hunting of these guys I'm not sure whether there has been a change in their spawning pattern or if it was actually possible to find severan Minfernals up at once earlier (in theory).<br /><br />If you still don't have one of these, they should be fairly easy to find now, at least on a low populated server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>travisgezell</b></h3>ok so i have been farming minfernal for 2 days and i can promis that if you do exactly what i did then u can easily get a spawn in less then an hour<br />day 1 killed every critter and battle pet in shatter scar vale that was not a minfernal, just ran around killing anything that moved that was not and infernal sentry or antropic horror and after about 30 minutes a poor quality minfernal spawned and i did capture it and upon switching to a different pet to finish off the other 2 in the battle i had a massive brain fart and fled from the battle the minfernal did not respawn so i had to continue farming and again after 30 to 45 minutes of killing any and all critters and battle pets in the area another poor quality minfernal spawned and this time i captured it and won the battle <br />told some friends about this and helped them kill critters for about 30 to 45 minutes and got another spawn and continued to do this 4 more times in total on 2 different days in a matter of 7 total hours i was able to get a total of 7 spawns for minfernal i can not promis that killing critters made it spawn but i can promis that if you run around killing critters for about an hour or so you will see one spawn<br /><br />happy hunting</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ilostmahbucket</b></h3>Just got mine with the kill all rats in shattered scar, killing all battle pets outside scar strategy. After killing the 12 rats in scar, I'd go kill some 20-25 battle pets outside and come back and wait. Took me about 1.5 hours on a very high pop CRZ server. I don't think the DK RPPVP strat is faster anymore.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Methusalar</b></h3>Just done the RPPVP method and can recommend it!<br /><br />facts and figures:<br /><br />been looking on and off for the Minfernal on my main realm (Doomhammer) for 3+ months and no luck. Whenever I tried killing all rats and other pets, someone else would be camping the site, so no point there.<br /><br />made a DK on a low-pop RPPVP server (Ravenholdt) and got it as soon as I made it up to Felwood.<br /><br />Took me about 2-3 hours all in, but if you've done the DK starter area before and know DK spells/abilities etc, you could probably do it in not much over an hour.<br /><br />For me, it's a no-brainer - 2 hours with a 'guaranteed' result or spending weeks and months for nothing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1019463</b></h3>Hi,<br /><br />I usually don't post comments here, but after this discovering I had to do it. After a lot of travels in different days trought Shatter Scare Vale and some hours camping there I decided to follow some tips found here and there. I started to kill Sentries AND all the critters around the area (mainly tainted rats and moths). Believe me, after 10 mins it was there! The awesome Minfernal! You can say it's just coincidence, whatever... Try to follow this lead take your own conclusions.<br />Nice hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LandeLando</b></h3>Got mine a minute ago. Was a poor quality, H/H. Ironically, I first heard about him today. My realm (Tol Barad) is listed as Medium pop but it's because it just does have many characters created on it, not actual player traffic. With less people to farm it, you're obviously at higher chances - so if you REALLY want this one, go and create a DK on a really, really low player traffic server. Many people go to low-pop servers to farm pets and other stuff, but you're aiming at a low traffic server. Ask your guildies, check the forums, everything counts. Once you find that realm where you're at Orgrimmar or SW in the middle of the day and it looks like it's far past midnight, then you're at the right place. <br /><br />Head to Felwood, go around killing (with character abilities, not battling) either battle pet rats or random non-battle (yellow name) critters around the place, don't know if really does help but everything counts if there's a chance to make Minfernal spawn. I spent literally 10min doing it, don't know if I made him spawn or he was just there, but he was there. Looks like he doesn't come as a secondary pet, you'll see him right away. Keep an eye on your minimap, it helps alot and that's how I found him (I was walking and facing the other way). If you go around flying you'll probably miss some creatures on your minimap because they take like 2-3 seconds to show there, and one of them could be Minfernal. That's a risk I'm not willing to take, so I went with my ground mount.<br /><br />I'm sure many of these things I just wrote were already said here, but think of this as a post putting it all together. I got a Flawless Battle-Stone earlier, was thinking about wich pet I should upgrade... Thank god I saved it. <br /><br />I'm sorry for any english mistakes, it's not my main language and I'm trying to do my best to help everyone and for you guys to understand me.<br />I'll submit a screenshot of mine at the very place I found him: near the river where you find some toads. He walks a little weird, looks like he's glitched.<br />Good hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1149744</b></h3>I just got Two!<br />One for myself and i engaged another until a friend got there and surrendered when he arrived so he could get it.<br />locations <br />47, 39 (i saw another but someone else got it wile i was battling) and<br />45, 41<br /><br />it really is worth it. i went there on a whim just to see. waiting for restarts and maintenance is truly a waste of time. just check at odd intervals. while everyone wants to camp on tuesdays, surprisingly few people are there on a wednesday. only take one. yes i went after two but i only captured one for myself and surrendered the other so a friend could take it before it was nabbed. battle stones make any pet potentially rare. dont be greedy. these are seriously elusive devils.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>demondancer08</b></h3>Does this pet show up by itself or with others?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>480715</b></h3>I don't comment too much on here, only if I have something useful.<br />I often don't really believe a lot of things people say on here, I always see it as &quot;that worked for you but it doesn't work for me thing&quot; - maybe I'm just impatient. I'm probably just impatient.<br /><br />Well, I tried the method of killing battle pets on Anachronos (medium PvE server; there were about 5 people camping and staying still), and it worked. I don't know if it was just chance, but I was there and looking for about 10 minutes before I read these suggestions. I flew around the shatter scar vale and the areas immediately outside and killed all the battle pets and critters I came across, and after 15 minutes of doing this, it spawned.<br /><br />When people kept saying &quot;kill battle pets&quot; I didn't really know if they meant defeat them or just kill them, but I decided, through lack of honour, to just kill them with fireballs. I did this for 15 minutes until POOF, a little minfernal (poor quality, unfortunately, but, hey, battle stones!) appeared.<br /><br />Make sure you've got the right pets lined up - either of the same level, or get your Terrible Turnip out. If you have to forfeit the match to rearrange your pets then you risk someone else catching it, and if you accidentally use a powerful 25 and kill it, you might start crying.<br /><br />As always, this is just what worked for me. I don't know if it actually made a difference or if it was chance, but I followed the advice of others and it worked.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mtrettin</b></h3>Finally got one tonight! =) This was my experience:<br /><br />I have been checking for this pet periodically since the release of MoP and have never seen one. I had not checked the spawn points for quite a while and I was about to log around 2:20am server time and decided to check for the minfernal. I flew around and there it was, just 1 by himself, not in a pack as others have sometimes described. I used a level 14 pet to get him in the capture range, he was easy to take down (in fact I was sort of afraid I would get an unlucky crit and do him under haha). The one that I found was a level 14 grey quality but I plan on upgrading him. Good luck, my advise is just keep checking back and you will most likely get one eventually, don't drive yourself mad by trying to camp the spawn. <br /><br />If you have an alt that you don't play much, park him at the spawn point and check it every now and again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vandrir</b></h3>I started camping on 11\14\2013 around 11PM. All I did was to circle the area where the impact craters are and scan for a Minfernal. At 1:22AM I spotted my first one. He was a level 14 and had a rare moth with him. I was not prepared for the battle since I didn't have a team set up and ended up losing the Minfernal by being beaten by the moth. I went ahead and camped for another hour with no luck and gave up for the night. I logged in the next day at 2:40PM and started camping again. At 4:30 PM I spotted another one and this time was ready with a team that I had setup specifically to fight a level 13-15 team. I captured him with no problem. Things of interest. The first battle he was with just one other pet. The second battle there were three. The first one was found at 45.02 \ 42.95 and the second was found at 42.73 \ 41.91. I tried killing as many critters as I could but that didn't seem to work. In the end I just stayed flying in one spot and that seemed to pay off. Good luck to everyone who is searching for this one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gargoyle</b></h3>Finally got mine today. Got tired of seeing seven or eight people hovering around camping this. Rolled a DK on The Venture Co, since it's a RP-PVP server....therefore no CRZ, did the quests to get to Ogrimmar. Took flight path out to Felwood, rode my horse out to the spot...no minfernals, but no other players either. Logged out, checked the next day, nothing. Third time was a charm, there were six. First one I battled was a rare H/H. I would have left at that, but no one else was there, so I farmed B/B and P/P breeds as well, non-rares.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ElicaQT</b></h3>I FINALLY got this one (9.30 am game time)! I <i>highly recommend</i> you to<b> create a macro</b> to easier find it; type &quot;/macro&quot; in chat to open up the macro window and write &quot;/tar Minfernal&quot; in the macro. Simply click it once in a while when you fly around the area (I experienced a small latency with the battle pet icon to pop up on the minimap, so you could miss one).<br /><br />Use a <a href="/npc=63365/terrible-turnip">Terrible Turnip</a> with the attack &quot;Weakened Blow&quot;, so there's no way you can kill the little bugger by accident.<br /><br />Second suggestion is that you <b>dont camp</b> the area for hours. The boredom and frustration will kill you. Have a char <b>parked</b> there and login once in a while (this is what I did and I got the pet on the 2nd day on this certain search period). If you're using all your chars, use your druid if you have one and portal to Moonglade and fly the short distance.<br /><br />Also, it says these can spawn by killing the big ones. I did try this and nothing happened, maybe I was just unlucky. Another theory is that you kill the battle pets in the zone cus the zone can only take a certain amount of battle pets. I tried this as well and yeah new battle pets seemed to pop up fast, but no Minfernal (I only tried this for about 15mins).</div>

Yesterday morning, around 9:30 Central Time (Cenarion Circle), I ran around killing everything I found in the area...battle pets, tainted rats, etc. Nothing spawned. After about 30 minutes of this, I parked myself in the spot and then just occasionally logged in. Woke up at 2:30 am, checked, and the Minfernal was literally right next to me. Captured it, logged out, and then logged in on my husband's account to try to get him one. No other Minfernal to be found. Woke up again right before the server reset, and no luck. Finally, around 7:30ish today (on a Sunday morning), logged in again. It was not at 46, 38, but wasn't far away. Did the killing of other spawns in the area help it to spawn? Not for us, but there's nothing that says someone else wasn't there killing spawns (though I didn't see them). I think what helped us the most was getting on at odd hours when most people would be sleeping to look for the Minfernals.<br /><br />Now to go find an Arctic Fox Kit...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jstrahan</b></h3>I spent several months on Hydraxis, maybe a couple hours a week looking for this guy. Not even ONE sight. I then created a DK on the Venture Co. server and got an uncommon one after only 3 visits, a total of about 5 minutes with this alt (after DK Jail, of course).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>connorsdad</b></h3>So I camped for this guy for three days in a row and got him on my last day. I did not kill any pets or enemies. Friday 1 spawned around 11:30 server time, Sat 1 spawned around 11:45 server time, and Sun 1 spawned around 12 server. So it looks like the pet will spawned within 15-30 minutes of 24 hours from the previous spawn. They all spawned in the same area, right by the big tree at 44, 41. Actually a bit to the right of the tree. Oh, and it was a poor quality one, but who cares I got the achievement. <br /><br />The flight path method won't work anymore either, I tired that and it said &quot;Can not battle in transport&quot; or something like that.<br /><br />Oh yeah, I also used a macro for easier targeting<br /><br />/cleartarget<br />/tar minfernal<br /><br />then set keybinding as &quot;Interact with target&quot; to number 2</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Heimdallen</b></h3>I looked for this pet for a little over a year basically every time I played, which is probably about 4 times a week on average over that time, on my primary server, Dalvengyr, which was very, VERY low population for the majority of that time. It was common to have less than 50 players online (alliance side) during prime time, from 6 pm to midnight. Despite that incredibly low number, every time I checked in Felwood there were always at least a couple players, horde or alliance or both, flying circles over the Minfernal Spawn area, so competition was still fierce. <br /><br />I gave up on Dalvengyr only a week ago, and made a DK on both Ravenholdt and Venture Co., and parked those DKs right around 44, 41 and proceeded to log on and check a few times a day. Within a week, I logged on Ravenholdt and there was a Minfernal literally under my feet. Couldn't believe my luck. It was at 5:45 pm EST and I quickly captured him, a rare Power/Speed variety. <br /><br />I highly recommend making a DK on Venture Co. and/or Ravenholdt (or perhaps any RP server with low pop as that seems to be the key) and taking the time to break it out of DK jail and park it in Felwood around 44, 41. I know other people who have had the same experience, searching for months or years on their PVP servers, be them low medium or high population, and then try one of these two servers and find their Minfernal in days. The couple or few hours it takes to break the DK out and get to Felwood is well worth it, in my opinion. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aksius</b></h3>Worked for me like this :<br />There was tainted rat critter (not a battle pet just critter) roaming where the spawn of the minfernals is. I killed it few times and on that spot i got the minfernal and no rat. Must say it has more than a minute respawn timer so i was also roaming around killing other critters. It was done on Eu- Frostmane at 2:00 AM server time and I think it really has something to do with the spawn timer of other critters. I saw another one the previous day at 1:00 AM also but while trying to tame it my pet killed it with a crit ( I smashed my monitor when i saw that :D) I hope this will help you and I am not sure if it has a spawn timer it seems to me more like it has to do with respawns of critters and other battle pets roaming around.<br />P.S you can use any pet to tame it with a high damage attack. He will not get 1 shoted because it is a magic pet.(u need to hit it at least 3 times in order to kill it). If you use a pet with multiple attacks like <a href="/pet-ability=455/batter">Batter</a> you might kill it if you get a proc.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>fleshfurnace</b></h3>I would like to add, after searching multiple times and spending a lot of time searching for this pet that since pets are account wide, you can log out multiple characters in the zone from different servers to have a much better chance at finding one of these. This was one of the last pets I needed and since i have multiple characters on a handful of realms I decided to leave 5 different characters in the same spot hoping to get lucky. I logged in after a nights rest to find one right next to me :) I wish i would have thought of this sooner!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1211696</b></h3>I left an alt flying above the spawn area (on home realm, which is medium/high pop) and waited. I once saw one minfernal, but another guy was too fast. There were always other players around.<br /><br />I checked my home server and a few other servers that I had 90s on. I checked at 6am, 2am and normal hours. I checked after Tuesday maintenance as soon as my server came up, and I checked after server restarts due to &quot;game play issues.&quot; Nothing. <br />So I did as many others have suggested... I made a toon on a RP server. <br /><br />I only ever saw 2 other DKs (also level 58) in all the days farming, but they didn't hang around for more than a couple minutes. So I started killing noncombat critters and critters you could battle in the area &amp; nearby areas, then I started killing Infernal Sentries, and then I started killing Entropic Horrors too. Nothing. Sure, I'd get the occasional battle Tainted Rat to spawn in the Shatter Scar Vale area... but no Minfernal. And I did this *a lot.*<br /><br />I logged in today. Didn't bother killing anything at all. Started reading my book. Looked up and saw a paw! It was a minfernal! I captured it and started riding north (to mail off my heirlooms)... there was ANOTHER minfernal! And then I rode a little to the west... and a THIRD minfernal. I got my husband to log in to get 1 of the others. <br /><br />By this time, I kinda knew all the critter spawn points for the tainted rats, so I went back around to look to see if the rats were up or not... and<b> the rats were all up</b>. <b>All the Entropic Horror and Infernal Sentry mobs were up too</b>, and <b>I didn't see any type of corpses in or around the Shatter Scar Vale area</b>. I did &quot;/who 1-99 Felwood&quot; and only saw myself (though I guess maybe a cross realm person wouldn't show up, but I also hadn't seen anyone around). <br /><br />So... although killing mobs &amp; critters can't hurt - as long as you don't blindly AE or get really far away if others are waiting at the spawn poin....<b> I don't think killing anything is required to get the Minfernals to spawn</b>. If there is a cap on the number of mobs or something, I think rares have their own separate count.<br />Good Luck!<br /><br />edit: a little over ONE hour later, I notice another paw... I rode around... 2 more minfernals had spawned! &gt;&lt; I've camped them in stretches of many many hours, but I guess their spawn timer can vary or something. One of the newer spawns was exactly where I tamed the first one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>182693</b></h3>Kill ALL of the Tainted Rats you can find (including the non-battle-pet critters). As long there is a Tainted Rat spawned, you will not likely get a Minfernal. Killing an undetermined (yet all you can find) number of Tainted rats will eventually cause a Minfernal to spawn. It took me about 10 minutes to achieve this and I really wasn't expecting it. The next day I went back and repeated this, so I am going to rule out random chance.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TriumphForks</b></h3>For everyone getting fed up trying to get one on CRZ realms. I eventually decided to make a death knight on a new Brazilian realm. As soon as I got out of the starting area I went to Felwood, and there was a Minfernal right there...after camping for days on my main server and never seeing one. <br /><br />I've read other people doing this with EU realms, and it does seem to work.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TotalMindcontrol</b></h3>Just found this little one while leveling my first 25 Team (currently 15). Seems it spawned with Immolatus. If you find Immolatus try looking for the Minfernal</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>stoferstoff</b></h3>in the case of the minifernal, like many other rare spawns, its spawn timer is not randomly long, it depends on the number of other battle pets in the zone. I caught 2 in under a half hour by battling other pet spawns all over the zone (mostly in irontree woods, abundant number in close proximity) and returning to shatter scar vale after every couple of fights to check for a minifernal spawn. some say you don't actually have to battle, you could just go around simply killing the battle pets you see, but either way, don't waste time camping</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Chaospaint</b></h3>My 2 Cents (Keep in mind I'm a long time collector,been playing for years and have tons of patience) <br /><br />Over the past year or so I've tried for this pet by parking toons across various servers here and just occasionally checking. To no avail. Tried all the tricks of killing and battling etc.<br /><br />Today i finally got the pet.<br /><br />What i did was i went to a RPPVP Server with a Low Pop. Made a DK (Like most of the posts say) Sat through leveling it through the starting zone. Got out, went to Felwood and saw nothing. Started killing critters and battled 2 rats and bam. Finally got it.<br /><br />Ill be completely honest i resisted doing it this way for a long time but as someone with a lot of patience i gotta say. If you've got the time and want it bad enough just do what i did. Level a DK on a low pop RPPVP server and get it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>johnnycashed</b></h3>I was with a friend farming one of these Minfernals while the server was having problems with staying connected. We fllew to Felwood to get it and as we was circling we found 2 of them spawned less then a couple yards away. She went to battle hers and it keep saying Failed to create Pet Battle. So we set for a min and waited till it was working. She battled it and killed it by mistake. She felt so bad her one chance of getting it and the pet spell overkilled and it died. I battled the other one and won it she grats me and we left to find other rare spawns. It was getting late she said she was going to logout at the spawn point and talk to me in the morning. While we was sitting in vent talking as she flew to logout. She said NO WAY I was like what? I found one. I said wow good luck catching it. She battled it and won and she said its a poor but guess what I got a battle stone for magic pet. I was in awe. So she was lucky and got a rare after all...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zenshu</b></h3>Got mine at 4:13 AM server time on Garona US. Spent about an hour randomly killing everything in the zone after successfully farming up an Undead stone for my Unborn Valk'yr and decided to spend the last couple of hours before bed looking for the minfernal. Spawned at Coords 42,42, lucky no one else was around because I forgot how rare they were and just stared for a few seconds marveling at the fact that is almost glanced over it because I was looking for a tiny pet not this huge &quot;by comparison&quot; guy. Promptly beat the crap out of him with my turnip and caught him, around then another Mage showed up looking for the minfernal so I hung around to help her look for one as I continued murdering everything in the zone, no more spawns for the 45 minutes - 1 hour we spent looking for a second spawn for her. So I guess what I am trying to say is it doesn't look like killing everything will help you with a forces spawn but at the same time can it really hurt?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Darlanio</b></h3>Was able to catch mine today (normal, white, quality - upgraded it with flawless battlestone) when relogging my 7 alts on diffrent realms all placed in Felwood.<br /><br />I got in on Stormscale (full, PvP) and was able to finish the battle without being attacked. All in all I have spent about 40-50 hours checking/camping Felwood. IRL time this took about 2 weeks, and I have not done much else in the game. Also got 80+ Felcloth from this hunt, which doesnt make up for the lost time.<br /><br />I have reason to believe that the easiest way is the suggested &quot;rolling a DK on diffrent low pop realms, camping Felwood with it and relogging it at diffrent hours&quot;-method.<br /><br />The mechanics for Minferal to spawn is <b>from what I believe</b>:<br />1. Recently killed critter in Shattered Scar Vale (empty critter spot)<br />2. Recently killed Infernal Sentry, close to this empty critter spot.<br />3. Respawn timer for Minferal off cooldown. (Others observations have caused them to doubt a respawn timer, but still might be one...?)<br />4. Battle-Pet somewhere in Felwood (full zone) killed, triggering a respawn of battle pet.<br />5. Very slim random chance that the spawning pet will be a Minferal.<br /><br />in other words...<br /><br />The mechanics <i>I believe</i> is that each time a pet is going to be respawned in Felwood (yes, full zone), there is a slim chance of it being a Minferal. BUT, to actually spawn a Minferal, there need to be an empty critter-spot in Shattered Scar Vale, a recently killed Infernal Sentry close by AND the respawn timer for the Minferal needs to be off cooldown. I can not prove this in any way, but it would be a reasonable explanation for this pet to be almost mythologically rare... or why not say Legendary Rare.<br /><br /><b>About rolling restarts: Minferal will not spawn directly after a rolling restart - Blizzard has &quot;bugfixed&quot; this...</b><br /><br />Anyone with a suggestion how to prove this, apart from getting a full raid group killing ALL in Shattered Scar Vale while another full raid group kills off all battle-pets and critters in the rest of Felwood for the duration of the respawn timer cooldown?<br /><br />Of course, such a proof will only work if repeated and statistically significant... but it will at the same time be able to prove if there is a cooldown timer at all... (without timer, the slim random chance becomes much more slim).<br /><br />And...<br /><br />Thanks Blizzard for letting me find a Minferal before I turned insane...</div>

Works 100%! 5.4+ patch<br /><br />Respawn rate at least 2 hours+ for the minfernal. So here is a method to do it in about 10-15 minutes for ANY RARE SPAWN PET! After 2 hours of spawn camping I finally figured it out and pass this secret on to the world!<br /><br />First in World of Warcraft press &quot;O&quot; and go to Other Raids Tab and que for Ordos and Celestial raid! Once you get picked up you transfer to that server...which hopefully one of the minfernals has spawned on that server... If not leave group and re-que for a different group. Took me 3-4 times before finding a server that had the minfernal spawns. Eazy as pie...<br /><br />Tip: to speed up the que time enter a high item level in comments you get picked up in less than 40 secs. Before queing make sure you are in the area/zone that you want to farm for the rare pet! Also the above method works for rare world spawns...farming...and other stuff.<br /><br />Also if you find this HELPFUL Please login and BUMP or Promote!(##RESPBREAK##)524##DELIM##thaia##DELIM##Good tip, but please do not post comments all in bold.</div>

Flew up and the first little paw I see is a minfernal! Poor quality but mine none the less. Sad that these pets can't be traded cause I wanted to give it to my hubby cause its the last pet he needs for the zookeeper title. If I can give any advice it would be to look late at night during the week because you won't see as many people out there camping, I think I saw 3 or 4 people there at the same time I caught mine.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1252871</b></h3>Farming <a href="/npc=62317/minfernal">Minfernal</a> should NOT be called farming. When you farm, you expect to harvest crops in a certain amount of time based on certain factors...The only factor here is luck, as with most dropped pets, but this is insane. It's been a year and a half of farming. I live near Amish farmers who harvest 2x before I see Minfernal once?. <br /><br />I officially place my request in to change the term &quot;farming&quot; to &quot;fishing&quot; where <a href="/npc=62317/minfernal">Minfernal</a> is concerned, an activity where a person sits in one place and waits........and waits, AND WAITS for some glimmer of hope....I would consider seeing one and getting beat to it to be the equivalent of a nibble in fishing. I haven't even seen my pole bend from a heavy tide yet. But I will continue fishing <a href="/npc=62317/minfernal">Minfernal</a> until I reel in a grey flounder and stone him into a blue whale! Blizzard, what's the deal?<br /><br />Sorry, my comments are usually far more helpful than this. I am hearing suggestions about being in <a href="/zone=361/felwood">Felwood</a> at server restart. I suppose that's my next move.<br /><br />5/26/14 between 5:57-6:12: I know it is just one day, but @ server restart, the only green paws popping up on my mini map were those dirty rats. I brought ranged to make sure they knew what I thought of them. I'll keep trying. Next time I post, I WILL possess one of these pets. Oh another thing, I did actually get to see one of these things in a PvP battle a while back. Watching it in action raises the question, why does <b>vanity</b> make us waste so much time? lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rahaf</b></h3><b>My Experience<u></b> .. I would really suggest to go with to battle all those Tainted Rats there and camp. I am on Draenor Server and I have been camping the area for couple of hours for two days. One day mornings and afternoon and second day around started at 10:00 pm - 12:25am. Finally I got mine today as a Primary Pet got into a nice battle and captured him easily. Un common but good for the<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=6585"></a> Achievement. Worth your patience move around a lot and <b>DON'T </b>just stay in one spot </u> and <b><i>YES it EXISTS</i></b> ! <br /><br /><b><u>NOTE</u></b>: Don't forget to put lvl 15-17 pets on your group. I was about to lose him I had 2 lvl 25s and one 20 when I started and thanks God I was easy on him. I was Lucky ^^ !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Majnen</b></h3>Just caught one at 23:57 server time, while it was raining. Not inside (or really anywhere near) Kroshius' circle of flame.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1269308</b></h3>I left my character out there over night and logged in this morning around 8:38am Eastern Time, went around and there were about 8 tainted rats just as I was about to stop looking I noticed there was one right in front of me. I caught it and looked around for anymore and even waited around for 20 minutes but there was nothing else but the one. Happy Hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nulanna</b></h3>I enjoy sarcasm as much as the next person - however, EZHK's comparison of the idea that you can produce a minfernal spawn by killing area battle pets with survivorship bias is seriously flawed. If some yahoo was just out killing pets and then happened upon a minfernal I might agree, however, this isn't quite the case. <br /><br />We know that the mechanics for node spawning, mob spawning, and yes, battle pet spawning is designed to work this way. Certain number of slots = killing to free up space for more possible spawns. This doesn't mean you can &quot;force&quot; it to spawn - just that, provided the required spawn timer has already passed and they are available in the pool of spawnable battle pets - you can greatly improve the chance for one to spawn if all of the BP slots are not full. Since this area is low level range - it makes sense that most of the battle pets are not shuffled often by being engaged. This is also why they tend to spawn upon server reset, when the slots are ALL available and they are in the pool of spawnable pets. <br /><br />If using this method has NOT produced the results you were hoping for within an hour or so - my conclusion would be the spawn timer is not up and they are not in the available pool of battle pets to spawn - I would wait a few hours and try again later.<br /><br />Although I always appreciate an attempt at satire - it doesn't work well when you are attacking something that is based on sound logic, an understanding of how the game is designed to function, and the very real ability to manipulate those mechanics in your favor.</div>

At 5:20 AM server time on the 4th of July, 2014 I logged in that character to make some flasks and a Minfernal was up. Only one was up and no other players were around. It was at loc 42.6, 36.6.<br /><br />I got damn lucky and it was a rare. It got me the title Zookeeper from the World Safari achievement as well as the achievement Kalimdor Safari. A nice way to start off Independence Day!<br /><br /><a href="https://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/713x250q90/842/juof.png" rel="nofollow">https://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/713x250q90/842/juof.png</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1286899</b></h3>A happy camper!<br /><br />I was so lucky today. Didn't camp at all for this Minferno, just leave a toon in Felwood and check on it once in awhile. Do a circuit or two around the spawn location then log off. Checked in today and got an Uncommon. Log off and back in again after about 1.5 hours then got a Rare Destruction. So happy!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ARedstone</b></h3>The best advice I can give anyone who's wanting to have this pet is to definitely wait until a server restart. I spent hours killing non-combat pets, npcs, and essentially running around in circles waiting for this beast to spawn, and it didn't happen.<br /><br />Days later, I'm not even farming this pet, and I notice the 'server shutdown 15:00' message and I remember a comment I read on wowhead relating to how they spawn before and after server shutdowns. I go back to felwood, bam, there are two, just waiting to be caught.<br />Be quick though, because one person had one of them, and I caught the other, only to be /spat on by another player. A minute later, I got to wetlands to find the Tiny Bog Monster, same thing, there's two of them as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Alkiphron</b></h3>Success, this time on Round 1!<br /><br />I camped the spawning area for a solid 3 hours, tabbing in and out. Took a hint from the other posters and started killing EVERY. OTHER. PET. in the zone (not with battles; straight up melee'ing them) Waited another like 20 minutes, started hearthing and it spawned.<br /><br />I had gone from:<br /><i>This sucks, I'll never get this pet</i> to <i>NEVER GIVE UP, NEVER SURRENDER</i><br /><br />Used the Unborn Val'kyr I had grabbed this morning and almost one shotted it (beware, it was only lvl 21 and it brought the Minfernal down to 98hp) Took 4 traps to nab it. So yeah guys, don't give up, every second you think you've wasted is gonna be another second of you cheesing out when you get it.<br /><br />For those who hate happy endings and want some hard facts:<br />-The Minfernal spawned near the docks in Bloodvenom Lake<br />-Killing other critters seems to work.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BMHunterMain</b></h3>Maybe a week ago I saw someone running around with a Minfernal and decided to camp a 90 at their spawn site and finally catch one. I caught a level 14, poor-quality Minfernal right away, just flew around the area, saw it, and caught it; no camping required.<br /><br />The very next day I was passing through Felwood on an alt (this one on a very high-pop server), checked again, and again there was a single level 14 poor-quality Minfernal. I went by again today while doing some Archaeology, and there was a lone level 15 poor-quality Minfernal running around. I checked for them three times and found one every time.<br /><br />Either I am incredibly lucky, or these guys aren't nearly are rare as they once were. Granted I am only getting the crap-quality Minfernals and not rare, uncommon, or even common... but these guys should not be all that difficult for you to catch if you really want one. Caught the first one Demon Soul (low pop PvP) and the other two on Darkspear (high pop PvP), all were caught late night/early morning.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Silancy</b></h3>Found one while doing quests on my rogue, it was poor but I caught it since I didn't have it, never realised it was so camped :P<br /><br />I suggest you make a character on Chamber of Aspects if you are on EU.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>all4atlantis</b></h3>Confirmed method that works:<br /><br />1) Make a dk on a low pop realm<br />2) Get to the minfernal area as soon as you are out of the starting zone<br />3) Identify the time that the server restarted. Each day around that time there will be at least one minfernal spawned.<br />4) Come back at that time the next day, at least 10-20 minutes early, and stay until either you get one or you reach the time identified in #3. <br /><br />I got my P/S common minfernal this morning, at 8:07am, when the server restarts this week were around 8am and took 15-20mins. Basically, the host for the CRZ I am in finished its restart between 8am and 8:07am.<br /><br />I hope that helps! Its my lazy-man's solution to this annoyingly rare pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1400142</b></h3>I found a Minfernal as soon as I got to the area. But, that was just to make everything more painful. I think there is a bug (or maybe it is intentional) that prevents you from entering Pet Combat in, like, the final 5 minutes before server reset. Same thing happened the other day in another area.<br /><br />So, all I could do was was click and be told I was already in combat. I spent the next couple hours farming the Scar and I saw ZERO Minfernals. Ohh, the pain. It hurts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>littleblueflash</b></h3>Just got mine after only 3 hours of looking. Spent some time last night trying to clear out critters and battle pets to get it to spawn and had no luck. Went off to work on my minecraft server all of today, got into wow late, did some missions and garrison stuff and decided to just take a look if it was up. Logged in and it was directly under me just running around with 3 tainted rats nearby. Got into battle right as someone else flew by looking for it.... <br /><br />Got a rare :) Super happy!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>750128</b></h3>I have absolutely no patience for farming for these hard to find pets and it doesn't help that I'm on a very highly populated realm. At any given time there are usually about 2-3 people circling around looking for Minfernals and that was even at 3 am in the morning (I couldn't sleep and thought I would try). I guess that's what happens when you sign up for a busy East Coast realm.<br /><br />I always joked about started a Death Knight on a low pop server over in Oceanic, figuring I might have better luck there. After the umpteenth time heading over to Felwood and seeing all the people waiting for Minfernals to spawn I figured 'Why Not?'.<br /><br />In the end - I have saved myself HOURS, probably DAYS of farming thanks to my Death Knight.<br /><br />Took me 3-4 hours to run my Death Knight through all the quests and you must do all the quests - I tried just running out of the area and there is a giant force field blocking you (btw first death knight - never had any interest in building one and still don't).<br /><br />Took me about 10 minutes to get to Felwood. There was a portal that I could take to Orgimar. I had to finish a quest (else no one would speak to me). It dawned on me I couldn't fly (only level 58), but no biggie - even though you haven't found all the flight masters they are already available to you.<br /><br />Took me about 10 minutes to scoop up 3 Minfernals just waiting around looking for adoptions. They weren't of good quality but each had their own breed (I have plenty of charms and upgraded the P/P one to rare).<br /><br />I figured while I was here I'd head over to Winterspring and nab a few Snowy Owls (Winter just started and everyone was out gathering Owls) and a Scorpling over at Blasted Lands. And when the only Wharf Rat on my main server was in a bad location I couldn't reach - I switched over and got that too (Along with EK Safari).<br /><br />Oh and with the money I made from selling some of the crafting material and a few green armor pieces I found I picked up some nice pets I found cheap at their AH too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DrJ105</b></h3>Finally got a Minfernal via the low-pop Oceanic realm method. Made the toon last night and didn't see any Minfernals. Logged in this morning, and there was a Minfernal right behind me. There had been a realm restart 30 min prior. I did not kill any rats or other battle pets. I didn't see anybody else killing rats. That was the only Minfernal I saw.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Buruan</b></h3>Add one more for Oceanic server method...<br />I threw in $60 to make a level 90DK, had to run campaign until Garrisson was built.<br />You guys are probably going to hate me, but in the span of less than 2h , i got the H/H Scourged Whelp I wanted for a long time, an Unborn Valkyr and a Minfernal.<br /><br />I am a happy Pet Collector today.<br /><br />Feel a bit dirty about spending the cash, but in this phase of my life, time is harder to come by than money.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>joekurr</b></h3>Absolutely the best way to get this lil' guy is by creating a DK on a low pop server (I used a PVP Brazilian server - Tol Barad) as many have posted. Headed to Felwood after the starter quests and after a quick scout of the spawn area, there was my lil' buddy waiting for me at coords 41,38! He was a P/P Uncommon; I don't know if Blizz was rewarding me for waiting so long for this pet, but it actually dropped a Flawless Magic Battle Stone as well! I couldn't believe it! I made him a rare right on the spot. Very happy right now! :)<br /><br />Although I refer to him as a lil' guy, he actually is quite big for a pet - almost as big as a human!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>634186</b></h3>I camped this pet on and off for a few weeks in December 2014. Regardless of the time of day, I always saw at least two other people there and I often saw as many as five.<br /><br />Taking the advice of several other posters here, I created a DK on a low population Oceanic server and proceeded through the initial quest line until I was deposited in Stormwind.<br /><br />After a quick trip to Felwood and seeing no one around, I killed several of the infernal mobs in the area and also leveled a few pets in battles against tainted rats nearby. Within 20 minutes a Minfernal showed up in the northern part of the spawn area. I even got a rare to boot. This was a great idea and I owe a debt of thanks to those who suggested it.<br /><br />Good luck to those still hunting this little dude.</div>

So must be a timer as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>turboforealz</b></h3>I started farming this guy a couple of days ago. I camped the area with 4 different characters on different realms (though several seemed to be on the same CRZ). After 1 day of looking once every 1h or so, I found a poor quality P/P which I stoned.<br /><br />Just for fun I continued looking for them. A day passed, and when I logged in I could see not one, not two... BUT FOUR(!) Minfernals spawned right next to eachother. One Uncommon, one common and two poor. So I got myself 2 more Minfernals and left the last two. This was on Ravencrest EU server.<br /><br />I've logged in several times since then (to maybe get a rare), but I havn't seen one since.<br /><br />Is this common? Have anyone seen FOUR Minfernals at the same spot?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bonavox</b></h3>I just wanted to add my experience. I used a few different tactics suggested. It also helped that I had two accounts to do this with so I didn't have to wait on a friend.<br /><br />1. Made a character on a new player server and used it to invite my main to group.<br />2. Flew my main from Orgrimmar to Felwood.<br />3. Landed in the vale and began player-killing critters.<br /><br />A Minfernal spawned after killing the 4th rat in the area. I captured it (was gray, but doesn't matter - I'll use a stone on it.)<br /><br />After capturing one I left the vale, player-killed more critters and pet battled a few others. Went back to the vale and killed more rats. Second Minfernal popped not long after (I left it for someone else that was also camping for one.)<br /><br />I had tried camping, making a DK on a low pop server, logging in to check now and then, etc. The above strat was the first one that actually worked, and I think killing the pets is what worked over being in a zone on a low-pop realm (all that did was eliminate some competition.)<br /><br />Good luck! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1048480</b></h3>I know it had been said before, but I <i>cannot</i> stress enough the importance of camping a toon in the area where your hard-to-find pet spawns. <br /><br />Even if you only have one character, the time spent to level it up to get it to Felwood pales in comparison to the stress you endure mindlessly battling rats or flying around the zone. <br /><br />Park a toon, switch to another and do your thing. Check back every hour, six hours, two days...whatever floats your boat. <br /><br />I did this for the <a href="/npc=71163/unborn-valkyr">Unborn Val'kyr</a>, with four alts spread over different zones. Took maybe a week of checking and swapping, etc. <br /><br />The same strat worked for the Minfernal not once, but twice! Caught one using the casual camp method. Logged into a hunter I'd forgotten about and lo, there was a Minfernal right beneath me. I managed to catch the eye of the undead flying around and nudged him toward it. Pass that karma around, folks. <br /><br />Happy hunting! xo</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ZzoOozZ</b></h3>several people have mentioned this method of finding the Minfernal but not in good detail. I saw this <a href="http://www.warcraftpets.com/community/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=13826">posted on the WarCraftPets.com forum</a> and wanted to share. I followed this advice, in the morning, and found 4 in a span of 20 minutes.<br /><br /><div class="quote-box">The future is cross-realm hopping and it works, it's fun and it's so easy to do.<br /><br />Step #1 - fly to the site of Minfernals or other hard to get wild pets (we also had luck doing this with scorplings, jade oozlings and wharf rats)<br />Step #2 - Use that 'Looking for Group' tool and go to the custom group<br />Step #3 - look for any group built for things like Kura/Eris pet tamer, Harrison Jones, Mats Trader, Enchanter Hut or just my Garrison is open and I have Auto-Accept is open.<br />Step #4 - Sign up for that group.<br /><br />Easy Peasy - these groups are all auto-accept so you will join immediately and cross over into their realm - monsters will suddenly shift or disappear with new ones appearing. Fly around a few minutes to see if any are there. If not just leave the group and look for the next one - 'rinse and repeat'.</div><br /><br />To add to what they suggested, when joining a group this way it will show you the name and realm of the person that started the group in the group finder dialog. It's just a matter of making a mental note of &quot;did I try this realm yet&quot; when selecting. <br /><br />Be warned, if you are from a PvE realm and go this route it sometimes brings you to PvP servers, you will be flagged for PvP when you cross over. Good thing is, when you leave the party and return to your realm the PvP flag will automatically be removed.<br /><br />enjoy!</div>

He was Poor Quality, but I'm fine with that. Minfernal showed up in the NE corner of the Scar, right near an Infernal.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Graknak</b></h3>I'm not sure if it helps, but i started killing non-battle pets/critters (mostly rats) that seemed to be roaming the possible Minfernal spawns together with the big infernals and it took maybe 10-15 mins before one spawned. Sadly poor quality, but at least i got it!<br />It feels like killing the trash critters and common battle pets in an area helps force respawns of the less common spawns (i've tried it before in other areas with increased success compared to normal) but then again we humans love to see patterns everywhere so it's probably a big pile of BS ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Darisper</b></h3>I highly recommend checking this pet's spawn point after hours if possible, especially if you are on a lower pop server or have access to one (or just aren't interested in the CRZ method). I spent two days occasionally scouting during the day with no luck, then I checked it at around 3am the next night (on a high pop server, mind) and managed to capture <b>two</b> Minfernals; one was poor, the other was uncommon. I upgraded the poor to rare via battle stone.<br /><br />I figure this is pretty standard advice for capturing most hard-to-find pets (as I successfully did the same thing with the Unborn Val'kyr), but I do realize a lot of people don't have the ability to log on late.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>xLexi</b></h3>I captured mine up on the hill where all the black holes in the ground are in the shattered scar in Felwood. I sat in that area killing every critter I saw (battle pet or not) and eventually one (just one, I flew over the entire area and there were no more anywhere else despite others saying they spawn in groups) and within 15-25 minutes I had my minfernal captured using only a poor quality level 14 huge toad to widdle his health down low enough to capture him. His only battle partner was a single tainted rat, and the minfernal itself was uncommon rarity. Patience is key here folks, but I highly recommend murdering all critters in the vicinity (or elsewhere in the zone, as the more you kill, the faster they seem to respawn in the zone to fill the lack of spawns) to make this go faster for you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1027229</b></h3>Ok, so I got one last night. Luckily no one was camping the area so it looks like the upgrade stones have had good effect. All I can say is that I circled the area killing literally everything, all the infernals, the fiery guys and all the tainted rats (which can be tough to see but you could make a macro.) <br /><br />After about 20 min I started a youtube video on finding the Minfernal then alt tabbed to keep going and there it was. <br /><br />So all i can really say is it may share the same spawn locations as the infernals as it seemed to spawn on one of them, but who's to say. Hell, it may be the magic of Youtube. At least there aren't constantly 10 people farming any more.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rrrof711</b></h3>I just got 2 minfernals at around 2:36am - 3:46am cst on Area 52 server. I have been hunting them for 2 or 3 days for hours on end (in total about 12 hours on multiple servers). I had to go and do other stuff because the music in Felwood is annoying and the waiting is very tedious with nothing really interesting to kill except the elite slime and it is almost as slow spawning as the Minfernal is. They both seemed to spawn after I started wiping out all of the battle pets in the large area that it is designed to spawn in (specifically the areas around the road from the far north before it bends all the way down to the battle pet master where the infected humanoids are especially all of the groups of cockroaches all the way west toward the huts with the humanoid slime things). I was also taking out the Infernals and Horrors too. Basically, I was just wrecking everything in the vicinity except the deer and wolves. Mostly bears, infernals, horrors and some of the fel infected. All of the infected cockroaches, squirrels, moth pets. Finally, it spawned at 48.38, 44.40 on the side of the hill near the lake. I got the second one about 45 minutes to an hour later at 46, 39 on the flat area northeast of the north pit. They were both poor quality. It does seem to help by clearing out the other battle pets in and around the spawn zone. Otherwise, they may not spawn because there are too many battle pets taking up space.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>isolde98</b></h3>Like many of you, this battle pet had been a great challenge for me. I had tried all the tricks in this post. I had alts. I tried the cross-realm maneuvers. The server resets. But still I had not seen a single minfernal. After searching other sites for tips I finally came across one that worked ...<br /><br /><b>Create a DK alt on an Oceania server.</b><br /><br />These are the lowest pop realms around. I went through the usual routine to create a DK and marched myself to Felwood as soon as I could. And what did I find? Minfernals! Minfernals all over the Shattered Scar! And no one else camping them!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Raistar</b></h3>I was able to &quot;server hop&quot; and find this pet right under me.

Hope this helps you all still hunting find him! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pops715</b></h3>After what happened to me this morning, I felt compelled to share my experience....<br /><br />Yesterday, I began my quest for the elusive Minfernal. I parked three alts from three different servers in the area and took turns camping, trying every tactic I had read about: cross-realm hopping, constantly killing infernals, etc. After spending all day and half the night keeping constant vigil and not seeing a single one, I was ready to come here and declare that, in MY opinion, these &quot;Minfernals&quot; had obviously been discontinued and were no longer available.<br /><br />But after sleeping in until well after noon today, I decided to give it one more try and logged onto my alt on Argent Dawn server. No sooner had I logged in than, lo and behold, there was a Minfernal! It was of poor quality, but I didn't care; I just wanted it. After the capture, I decided to make the rounds of the area, just for the heck of it. Within 10 seconds, I found another one! This one was also poor quality but again, I didn't care; now I'd have two of them!<br />I quickly captured it and started to fly away when suddenly, there was a THIRD Minfernal! I'm thinking, &quot;WTF? They're suddenly everywhere!&quot;. This third one was, again, of poor quality but I captured it anyway.<br /><br />UPDATE: In the past couple of days, I've been able to replace my poor quality Minfernals with uncommon ones. The best tip I can give anyone looking for these little guys is to get on Argent Dawn server. They seem to always be there when I log in to check the area out. Yesterday, there were six at one time! I checked just now and there were two. (I'm still looking and hoping to come across a rare one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>caliee</b></h3>After quite a break from WoW I returned and one of the biggest surprises for me what how much I liked collecting battle-pets. This was one of the last wild pets on my list before Legion with the exception of the Snowy Owl (I have to wait for winter for that one), any ways to the point.<br /><br />I struggled to get this pet and spent many hours trying to farm it. I tried forcing spawns by killing hundreds of the rats that spawn across the zone to free up spawns, no joy out of about 10-15 hours trying on and off; killing or battling hundreds of rats. I tried camping but there always seemed to be several cross-realmers doing the same, everyone has the same thought it seems to think evenings are the best time to camp . <br /><br />I finally got it by parking an alt there and every day I started playing wow I just logged the alt first for 5 minutes to check. 2nd day of doing this when I got it, I logged on there was literally one at my feet. I caught it and afterwards I noticed a second just 100 yards away. 2 minfernals and no rats. I would hazard a guess that they are purely a timed spawn, and can't be forced, possibly spawning 2 or 3 when they finally do. I caught mine around 2pm, and after checking the second one wasn't a better breed I left it and advertised it in the zone. No one turned up in the 5 minutes I waited, I left it there for some lucky adventurer to find.<br /><br />I'd recommend the parking an alt and checking the zone that way on and off as I wasted 10 hours being bored. It's not like Felwood has a particularly jolly soundtrack or is particularly profitable :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kaziel</b></h3>With the release of Legion, they changed cross-realm hopping so that it is now a lot harder. So for all the advice here that basically boils down to &quot;Just realm hop!&quot;, I won't say it's impossible, but it's a lot harder. Here's why:<br /><br /><ul><li>Zones are now independent and you change realms in there depending on its current flag. Flag is put once a player is in a group and enters a zone. Flag is being removed when all players leave that zone.</li><li>Youâ€™ll be transferred if youâ€™re in a zone, and you join a party with a player already in that zone.</li><li>Youâ€™ll be transferred if you enter the zoneâ€™s by crossing its border and thereâ€™s already a player from your group in that zone.</li><li>Youâ€™ll NOT be transferred if you enter zone if no other player from your party is there.</li><li>Even if youâ€™re not a leader, if you were the only person from the group in the zone and another player from that group comes to that zone, he will be transferred to your realm, since youâ€™re the first person, who entered that zone while in a group.</li></ul><br /><br />If you want a more detailed explanation of how it works, see <a href="https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/server-hop/pages/changes-to-cross-realm-in-legion/" rel="nofollow">https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/server-hop/pages/changes-to-cross-realm-in-legion/</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bowedoak1</b></h3>Everyone on my server said it took them a month to find theirs and after about six weeks of alt checking, I finally did as others suggested and made a DK on a low pop Oceanic server, Aman'Thul. Felwood was dead, literally no one was there except another DK that popped in for five minutes and left. <br />After two hours, while I watched a movie, one popped up. It was grey. I grabbed it and came back an hour later and there were three more. I checked for a blue and they were all green so I left them and let general know the coords. One guy got on his horde toon and came about 15 minutes later. The other was still there an hour later. <br />I first saw the min at 11 Eastern. I'm going to check at the same time tomorrow etc, but as much as a pita it is to make a DK, it's much easier than waiting six weeks. <br />Good luck.

I've read all the forums here and warcraft pets and tried everything.<br /><br /><b>Things that WONT work.</b><br />The flight path macro trick. That got patched a long time ago and it now says you cant start a pet battle while traveling.<br /><br /><b>Things that MIGHT help</b><br />Download Cross Realm Assist addon and see if you can instance yourself into other realms. The catch here is that since legion is out now it will only instance you into another felwood if like somebody in that group is already in felwood. So 90% of the groups wont instance you into a new instance, but if you want its worth a try.<br /><br /><b>What worked for ME</b><br />My realm is pretty busy so I followed the advice on here and made a death knight on Aman'Thul -- a low pop oceanic server. Originally I <i>really </i>didn't want to do that I thought it would be a waste of time, but it only takes 1 hour if you are quick. Around night time (USA time) there were very few people in the zone so less cahnce of somebody killing you/stealing your minfernal. The downside is that you will be restricted to a ground mount, but if all your main chars are on a very busy server I would still recommend rolling an oceanic dk.<br /><br />I tried the strategy of slaughtering Infernal Sentrys for a combined total of maybe 4-5 hours across 3 days and got nothing. I came back on here and read a comment about killing the critters/other battle pets and decided to try that. I had done it in the past for a few hours and not seen anything but I figured it was worth a try again. It took about 20 min of killing all the rats and moths and stuff around the pools (along with some Infernal Sentrys as well) and then a minfernal appeared on the west of the westernmost middle pool. It could have been chance, but I had been afking most of the day and running around every hour or so and seen nothing. I believe that killing critters opened up the spawn for minfernals. So if I were you I would try that.<br /><br /><b>The Spawn</b><br />Some notes, it was about 1:45PM on Amun'Thul, (11:45pm Eastern Time) and it was raining in the zone.... although I really don't think that matters. Best of luck to anyone else going for a minfernal. In total it took me about 3 days. Logging on and off every few hours and spending 3-4 hours every day killing and camping.<br /><br /><b>TL:DR</b><br />Roll a DK on a low pop Oceanic Server<br />Kill all critters (and maybe Infernal Sentrys too)<br />Stay strong</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Neglesh</b></h3>Got incredibly lucky. Was finishing up some pet achievements and decided to check Felwood for the Minfernal (not expecting any to actually be there, as I'm on a high pop realm), but I managed to find a single Minfernal running around!<br /><br />Good luck to others!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>maxflat</b></h3>Like most people I never saw one spawn on my server (Medivh) even after parking an alt in Felwood and checking several times a day. There were usually at least 2 other people hunting them. So I decided to create a Death Knight on the lowest pop server with no linked server which for the Americas is Tol Barad Brazil, only 76,000 total characters including both factions. Felwood was a ghost town and I got one after my third or fourth check.<br /><br />Now I'm heading down to Tanaris to see if I can get an Infinite Whelpling, I've checked so many times on Medivh the last few days that it's making me wonder if Legion broke them.<br /><br />Edit: There were swarms of Infinite Whelpling in Tanaris, I picked up on of each breed and there are around 20 left. Did not kill any hunting for rares, I like to leave them for other people and it's easy to get stones now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rexwrecks</b></h3>Let me preface this comment by stating that I am not claiming to know how the minfernal spawn actually works. This could have been coincidence. But I wanted to stop by and share what I was doing when this spawned just in case there is some sort of association. I know I am not the only person who has made these associations, I also know that people disagree. <br /><br />I've been swinging by the spawn points for months. The past week I have actually dedicated a toon to just sitting over the pools and having her log in every few hours. This is the first time I have even seen a minfernal, thankfully I didn't have much competition. My server is pretty dead in the mornings even with CRZ (I caught mine around 8:40am PST). <br /><br />Not exactly sure what I wanted to work on first today, I flew my camped toon around gathering some ore and battling pets to level some of my lower levels. I figured since I had done that I might as well kill some of these infernals (the flavor text does hint towards a relation). Seriously, I barely made two passes through the infernals before one popped up top (44, 41 I think it was). It was poor quality, but I did not care. I nabbed that little fella and I'll just use a stone on him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ThunderZtormDK</b></h3>I don't know if they've changed the spawnrate or something - but I just found LOADS of Minfernals wandering about - without even really looking for them.<br /><br />Captured two, but there were still plenty. At one point I had FOUR visible on my screen just walking about.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SaltLB</b></h3>My advice is hit it early. Keep an alt in the area and log on before you go to work, say around 6 AM? Might not always be one there for you but at least the chance of you competing with another player for the pet battle is reduced.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tforce65</b></h3>This may have been posted before, just brining it to the top of the posts.<br /><br />Creating an Oceanic DK toon was easily the best way to catch this pet. <br /><br />But you should know that if you're hoping to get credit for the Kalimdor Safari &amp; World Safari achievements, you won't. :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>venndann</b></h3>Took me an hour and I got an uncommon minfernal on first try. This strategy worked for getting a Scourged Whelpling on an overfarmed server so I thought I'd try it for the minfermal. Most of the hour was spent making a DK on a low-pop BRAZIL server. Flew to Whisperwind Grove, seeing a bunch of minfernals on the ground as I passed over them. There were 4 in close proximity. The first one I fought was uncommon, so I left the others alone. Good luck, folks!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>avatarofshadow</b></h3>What I did just now was create a level 100 test Mage on a low pop server, hit Hearthstone, trained the Darnassus port, ported to Darn, flew to Felwood, and boom, two Minferals waiting for me. Wish I'd done it yesterday, instead of spending a few hours camping them on one of my regular characters.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Linderel</b></h3>Caught one just now; alas, it's only a Common, but I'll take what I can get. Appeared after I'd killed some 15 or 20 Infernals and murdered a couple of Tainted Rats in battle. Don't know how high the correlation is, but there you have it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gottabethebest1</b></h3>With Legion came the lv100 Trial toons; I just started a Tauren on Aman'thul (Oceanic), used free portal stone to go to Garrison, then portals to Orgrimmar. Flight paths are all there, I can fly and have fast flight speed, I checked pet battles in Orgrimmar. Flying to Felwood now.<br /><br />12:14am PST - HOLY FRICK just flew in and they are everywhere.<br /><br />Caught one - but there are more, so I'll hunt for a better quality one. Registered in my achievements. <br /><br />This is the greatest thing I've ever done. Tauren are amazing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>squidbob</b></h3>Log onto a low population server and do the rounds where this pet spawns.<br /><br />got mine in 5 minutes of logging onto a low pop server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ainguss</b></h3>Spent a lot of time looking for this guy on Whisperwind server and finally decided to followed the advice of previous posters. Created a DK on the Saurfang server. Spent about 2 hours finishing quests so I could get him out of the newb area. Ended up in Orgrimmar and flew to Felwood. There were about 5 minfernals about. I chose one and he was green so I am happy. Good luck fellow pet masters!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jacoblr28</b></h3>I didn't even know I had this thing. I guess it's rare but I found one and got it because it looked cool. so lucky me</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ShaktiVel</b></h3>I finally got my Minfernal after following advice on Wowhead. Made a DK on a low pop Brazil server and did the work to get her to Felwood. There werenâ€™t any Minfernals around when I got there, but no one was camped waiting either. I cleared all of the battle pets in the area and logged out. I logged back in a few hours later and saw my first Minfernal. I got two uncommons, but never did find a rare. I kept logging in casually and there were always Minfernals around, but never any rares, but never anyone camped either. Got a Flawless Battle Stone from one of my Minfernal battles and just used that. Now my DK is camped waiting for baby apes :)<br /><br />Side note: I realized the most important thing is to clear the battle pets in the area. When I was farming Obsidian Warbeads for hours in the same cave (just NE of Halaa), there were two mining nodes that would spawn in the cave as quickly as I could clear it. I cleared them each time I went through and about 10% of the time at least one would be khorium instead of adamantite. I realized itâ€™s the same with the battle pets â€“ Minfernals canâ€™t spawn if you donâ€™t clear the tainted rats. And it definitely helps to be on a server where no one is camped.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Amah</b></h3>The minfernal is still a slow, incredibly maddening spawn. It seems to share a respawn with all the other battle pets in the area. Worked with a buddy to kill all the other battle pets in the Shattered Scar Vale. Killing the infernals didn't seem to work. Nor did it matter that we killed the rare infernal silver dragon. We worked the area off and on for 3 days, no luck. We saw a lot of other folks from other servers working the area, so it may be that one spawned and someone else grabbed it. Finally my buddy rolled a DK on a low population server that doesn't CRZ, an RPPVP server, and was able to capture a minfernal after a restart. The little guy was east of the three pits towards the named quest target, around 47, 39. My buddy caught the wanderer's festival turtle easily. There were 3-4 with no competition. Good luck and happy hunting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aynsranitar</b></h3>Read somewhere that this guy was harder to find than Unborn Val'kyr, which took me 2 days to find and I just caught a couple hours ago.<br /><br />Flew into Felwood from Hyjal and he's the first thing I see. (45,38)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>naenae312</b></h3>I always check Felwood every day on the servers that I have alts on and sure enough there will be a minfernal or two up. Since I already have one, I do my good deed of helping others get them. Ill make a group on the server letting people know that one has popped up on the realm that I am on. So if you guys ever see a group about pet collectors join it for you Minfernal!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>WorgN6</b></h3>I don't know if this is the norm, but I checked a dead US realm the other morning at like 3am, and there were at least a dozen Minfernals up. Way, way more than should've been. I'm guessing the spawn has been increased substansially.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hobbyhorse</b></h3>I'm looking for a P/P Minfernal and have three chars in different realms place at this zone.<br /><br />I did look for Minfernal at two chars, there was none. At the third char I found one, but it was not P/P. I dit take another look at the other two and I did found one at both chars.<br /><br />For me, Minfernal did respam on those three realms at same timestamp.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>grammieof9</b></h3>Well guys, after 3 hours of killing, battling and more killing, doing everything you said to do. Well, I STILL have yet to see the first one. So, I tried to do a dance step or 2 and a pirouette. Doc said my broken ankle will heal nicely. On the bright side, I WILL have time now to camp him.</div>

It was a Lvl 14 Common, so I gently battered it down with my Lvl 11 Fluxfire Feline and captured with a Lvl 13 Stinkbug. Hope this helps someone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cyrica89</b></h3>I cant believe this worked.<br /><br />I made a DK on an oceanic realm (low pop), once I got out of the starter zone I used the flightpath to get to the minifernal spawning area. It was immediatly available, and also a rare. <br /><br />I highly reccomend trying this strat out, at the very least you'll have a toon on a great realm for getting this pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>themudhud</b></h3>Finally had my moment to catch this elusive pet!<br /><br />After a difficult time finding any updated information, was able to be home during an afternoon maintenance window for Blizzard. The maintenance window was supposed to end at 1 PM PT and I kept checking for the servers to come back up. As soon as they did, I logged into my toon that was camped near the minfernal area and no joke, there was one waiting. After all this time, there it was and the Zookeeper achievement was mine! <br /><br />Don't camp out - just get yourself setup for the servers to come back online and have your toon waiting. The minfernal was in the area that everyone has explained.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rhacius</b></h3>I remember this being extremely rare and spending hours trying to catch it as it was the last one I was missing for some achievement, and then I was leveling an alt the other day through Felwood and there were mininfernals spawned all over the place. I caught 2 extra ones and there were still some left! <br /><br />Basically, if you want to catch one don't be disheartened by these outdated comments saying how rare they are.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kemaria</b></h3>I farmed the infernal sentries for over an hour and not a single minfernal appeared. Just lots of <a href="/npc=62316/tainted-rat">Tainted Rat</a> that met swift and vengeful ends once they encountered me. I'm on a low pop PVE server, and just as I was about to log out and check again later, I asked a real ID buddy on a high population RP server to help me out. He came over to Felwood, so I would actually transition over to his server, and it worked! Minfernals were literally <i>everywhere</i>! Instead of periodically aarghing over yet another <a href="/npc=62316/tainted-rat">Tainted Rat</a> appearance and wishing in vain for a new green pawprint to appear on my minimap, I now had my choice of precisely which minfernal I felt like battling, and my friend got to get his own as well. When I left group and transitioned back to my realm, all the remaining minfernals disappeared again.<br /><br />I had a similar experience recently when I wanted to tame some low-level rare hunter pets. None were available on my realm and they seemed determined not to be available no matter how long I waited or how many times I came back to check. As soon as a I joined a group with a friend on a high population server (a PVP one that time), every pet was just where I wanted it to be. <br /><br />Just wanted to post this in case it helps anyone else: try to group up with friends on high population servers who will come over to the zone to help you out. This will make you happy, and it will make the <a href="/npc=62316/tainted-rat">Tainted Rat</a> population very happy, too. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BeauCharles</b></h3>First try getting it there was one spawned and he turned out to be a rare. Kind of surprised at all the comments how difficult it was to find. Maybe there's a better spawn rate now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>webzagar</b></h3>One spawned today almost immediately after I killed all the tainted rats in the area. Don't know if I got lucky or if the spawn points are shared but worth a try.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>VanAllTheNames</b></h3>I've been trying for this since pet battles first became available. <br />They must have recently adjusted the amount, as like others, I logged in to find about 5 of them just chillin in Shatter Scar Vale.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kannane</b></h3>I can confirm that these are now plentiful (at least on Blackwater Raiders). After battling probably a dozen or so of these I saw 3-4 uncommons, no rares. Decided to use a battlestone instead.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mistmare</b></h3>I think these are pretty common now or I just got lucky around spawn time. Saw a ton on Dalaran server 40.19 40.32 in Felwood about 2:15pm server time. Announced in Zone, no one seemed to care. I caught 3, one rare and left the rest up for other ppl.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ehayen</b></h3>In 2020 these are still a rare spawn but since nobody cares about them anymore there's no rush to pounce on it when it appears.<br /><br />So if you're a completionist just trying to get all your pets, no need to worry.</div>

The area is quite literally filled with them now. Either their spawn rate was dramatically increased or simply nobody is hunting them anymore. So if you've been wanting one of these for years and have had no luck, now would be the best time to get one. Who knows if/when they will nerf the spawn rate again.</div>
