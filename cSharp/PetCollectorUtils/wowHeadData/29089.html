If a seller is unwilling to do so or makes an excuse, walk away. Another thing to check is the image of the card on sale sites, simply drag the picture into Google image (http:\/\/images.google.com\/imghp?hl=en) and what that will do is see if that same pic is listed anywhere else, great way to see if the picture\/sale is a duplicate, if so it's most likely a fake listing. Lastly if the current image is cropped that's suspicious, all Tyrael cards have a serial number stamped on the code side of the card along the edge, get a picture of that code! Next contact Blizz CS and ask if that card has been used (also search other auctions to see if the same card with same serial number is used on any other bid.) This is a last resort if you truly want to buy the card but unsure about the seller because something is raising a red flag. If the seller refuses to get a picture to you showing that serial number printed along the side, again, walk away.  I've only put this here because I know many a broken hearted collector who has gone through the headache of trying to retrieve their money back after the sale was fake.\n\n[b][u]ABOUT THE PET[\/u][\/b]\n\n[u]In Battle[\/u]\n\nThis pet is a brute! \n\n[petability=766] is a 100% stun!\nTeamed with a pet which can deal [petability=256] Tyrael's [petability=769] is another powerful stun.\n[petability=770] is a first move heal.\n\nJust think of the team possibilities, it's quite powerful and I've yet to have him fall on me.\n\nAlso as a humanoid he will recover health after each hit, so that pared with [petability=770] makes him hard to kill, even against an undead.\n\n[u]Out of Battle[\/u]\n\nTyrael likes to bust a move just cast \/dance and watch him go.

At these conventions players and industry were invited to try Blizzard demos and games and in 2008 the invitation, 8,000 in total, also included this pet code. <br /><br />Similar to TCG there is a panel on the plastic invitation you scratch and a code is revealed which must first be redeemed at Blizzard's promotion retrieval page : <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/misc/en/" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/misc/en/</a> (you must choose region then realm to obtain the in-game code.) On your selected realm, once you have obtained the in-game code to redeem you either visit Edward Cairne (Undercity) or Ian Drake (Stormwind) and 'whisper' the code to them. The pet is then placed in your bags and you can not trade it and once learnt you can not cage it.<br /><br />As of August 2014 the sell price is between $1,300 - $2,600 (from current cards on the web) and please note there are many fake sellers out there trying to cash in so if you are a collector, or someone wanting to buy this for a player please buy with caution, never use direct deposit as a form of payment (hard to retrieve your money back from bogus sellers) and if buying from Amazon or eBay please read the feedback first, read the description (for any shifty fine print) and contact the seller asking them to take a picture of the card (unscratched side up) with either your name or a code word written on paper next to it to make sure the seller is legit. If a seller is unwilling to do so or makes an excuse, walk away. Another thing to check is the image of the card on sale sites, simply drag the picture into Google image (<a href="http://images.google.com/imghp?hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/imghp?hl=en</a>) and what that will do is see if that same pic is listed anywhere else, great way to see if the picture/sale is a duplicate, if so it's most likely a fake listing. Lastly if the current image is cropped that's suspicious, all Tyrael cards have a serial number stamped on the code side of the card along the edge, get a picture of that code! Next contact Blizz CS and ask if that card has been used (also search other auctions to see if the same card with same serial number is used on any other bid.) This is a last resort if you truly want to buy the card but unsure about the seller because something is raising a red flag. If the seller refuses to get a picture to you showing that serial number printed along the side, again, walk away. I've only put this here because I know many a broken hearted collector who has gone through the headache of trying to retrieve their money back after the sale was fake.<br /><br /><b><u>ABOUT THE PET</u></b><br /><br /><u>In Battle</u><br /><br />This pet is a brute! <br /><br /><a href="/pet-ability=766/holy-justice">Holy Justice</a> is a 100% stun!<br />Teamed with a pet which can deal <a href="/pet-ability=256/call-darkness">Call Darkness</a> Tyrael's <a href="/pet-ability=769/surge-of-light">Surge of Light</a> is another powerful stun.<br /><a href="/pet-ability=770/restoration">Restoration</a> is a first move heal.<br /><br />Just think of the team possibilities, it's quite powerful and I've yet to have him fall on me.<br /><br />Also as a humanoid he will recover health after each hit, so that pared with <a href="/pet-ability=770/restoration">Restoration</a> makes him hard to kill, even against an undead.<br /><br /><u>Out of Battle</u><br /><br />Tyrael likes to bust a move just cast /dance and watch him go. Once upon a time he always danced but now he does stop (unsure when that was implemented.)<br /><br />Poor baby gets sleepy so will fall asleep, even in mid air, and while snoozing with scratch his derriere... it's pretty funny.</div>
