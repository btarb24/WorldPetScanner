After I did so the other battle pets were visible so you can try for a Blighthawk as an add, good luck.\n\nedit: I will expand my statement since someone said that I was wrong.  I went searching for this pet and saw there markers in Andorhal but could not target any so as I got to the edge of Andorhal and entered the area The Writhing Haunt I noticed that the Blighthawks disappeared and I think it was a rat but can't remember took there place. I deduced that some phasing was going on so I checked to see if I had finished the Andorhal quest chain and viola I had not.  I finished up the last two in short order and low and behold there were targetable pets in Andorhal.  I could still not get a Blighthawk to target but I targeted the other pet and received the Blighthawk as a secondary which I then trapped. Now I am not sure if it was just a bug or because I had not finished the quest chain but I made my above statement so that if someone was coming here to looking for a suggestion on what to do if they were unable to target or find the Blighthawk maybe my observation could in some way aid them in their search for said pet.  So I still stand by my statement and do not feel that it is wrong just did not think I need to type a whole wall of text. I probably could have been more informative and concise but was playing at the same time as I am while writing this.

In case you don't want to search for them - I decided to add my own for those that do a \"Newest First\" thread search.\n\nThe bug is - you can see them appear on your mini map (either a Blighthawk or a Black Rat in the Andorhal area) - but when you get to close they disappear.  This is a phasing issue with the area.\n\nThe way around that is THIS:\n\n#1:  Bind the \"Interact with Target\" button (under targeting functions) to a hotkey\n#2:  When you see them appear - KEEP YOUR DISTANCE so they stay on your screen or you'll lose them\n#3:  Target them from a DISTANCE\n#4:  With a flying mount (because of the speed) - hit autorun straight towards them - making sure you hit the ground running - and keep slamming the hotkey (interact with target) and right before they disappear you will enter into a battle with them\n\nIf you lose them - not to worry - just backup a few paces and they will re-appear on the screen.\n\nHope this helps.  I have already submitted a bug report on the issue (as I am sure others have too) - hopefully they will fix it but until THEN - this works.\n\nGood luck.","date":"2014-07-06T14:04:01-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2014-07-06T14:04:21-05:00",1,"Silvansaria"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":38,"id":1981139,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"robo456","body":"found this post from warcraftpets.com by Sarcasmo \r\n\r\n------------PASTE------------------\r\n\r\n*Phasing is the main issue collecting this bad boy.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>Blighthawks are found in the area of Andorhol, flying among the ruins. A low level may have to clear out a couple mobs, depending on where it happens to be, but they're fairly easily reachable without *too* much difficulty. When clicked, they make rather typical-sounding birdlike squawks and the like.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JBonezzz</b></h3>If you are having some issues with not seeing any other battle pets you might check and finish up the quest chain in Andorhal. After I did so the other battle pets were visible so you can try for a Blighthawk as an add, good luck.<br /><br />edit: I will expand my statement since someone said that I was wrong. I went searching for this pet and saw there markers in Andorhal but could not target any so as I got to the edge of Andorhal and entered the area The Writhing Haunt I noticed that the Blighthawks disappeared and I think it was a rat but can't remember took there place. I deduced that some phasing was going on so I checked to see if I had finished the Andorhal quest chain and viola I had not. I finished up the last two in short order and low and behold there were targetable pets in Andorhal. I could still not get a Blighthawk to target but I targeted the other pet and received the Blighthawk as a secondary which I then trapped. Now I am not sure if it was just a bug or because I had not finished the quest chain but I made my above statement so that if someone was coming here to looking for a suggestion on what to do if they were unable to target or find the Blighthawk maybe my observation could in some way aid them in their search for said pet. So I still stand by my statement and do not feel that it is wrong just did not think I need to type a whole wall of text. I probably could have been more informative and concise but was playing at the same time as I am while writing this. Happy hunting and have fun.<br /><br />second edit: Also like someone else stated try at night for better results.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>797175</b></h3>Had some trouble finding the blighthawks, although I saw the marker on my minimap. (Probably had to do with having not quested in Western Plaguelands). Used /tar blighthawk, and a key binding to interact with target, and was able to fight them anyway without any trouble.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1039411</b></h3>I also had trouble finding them despite seeing the battle pet icons on my minimap, but it wasn't due to them spawning underground - they were all floating above me, &quot;sitting&quot; in mid-air. Bug I'm guessing.<br /><br />Finally caught an uncommon out of the 6 or so that were spawned. Slow repop, but I'm hoping to catch a rare soon.<br /><br />*EDIT: It would seem that JBonezzz above is correct - I did indeed have to finish the Andorhal quest line (the ENTIRE THING.. UGH) until I stopped phasing. Afterwards - LOADS of battle pets everywhere. Much obliged, JBonezzz.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>fademyken</b></h3>I can confirm both jbones and finalangel's comments after <a href="/quest=27083/the-battle-resumes">The Battle Resumes!</a> all the blighthawks became visible on my minimap (save for a scarce 1 or 2 stuck in the terrain graphic as when i am close i can /target them) then after finding no rares in 10 battles the respawn seems rather slow. I have since completed the full andorhal quest chain but I think I have phased myself out of ever seeing blighthawks again on this toon, as I only see black rats now and the &quot;unengagable&quot; blighthawks. My best advice would be to turn in <a href="/quest=27083/the-battle-resumes">The Battle Resumes!</a> and stay at that phasing point until you have caught your rare. hope this helps</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jxnboy007</b></h3>Blighthawk is capturable w/out the Andorhal quest chain. After reading other comments, upon seeing a lvl 10 Black Rat battle pet, I challenged and a Blighthawk most indeed showed up in 2nd position (A lvl 10 U/C=uncommon). He surprised me with a heal and managed to nearly kill my lvl 10 mechanical, but that might have something to do with the fact that I was handling him <u>gently</u> as not to kill him; I did not want to have to keep searching. <br />info:<br />Blighthawk- lvl 10 UnCommon in 2nd position (target Black Rat lvl 10)<br />location; 46,53 Dalson's Farm, Western Plaguelands<br />3:20am Eastern U.S. (why am I up this late?)<br /><br />Good Luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>235986</b></h3>If you can see them on your map but when you stand on top of them you can't see them, there is still a way to capture them. Go into your keybind options and look under &quot;Targeting Functions&quot; for &quot;Interact With Target.&quot; Set it to something--I picked &quot;shift-;&quot; but you can use whatever you want. Stand over the area where you map says they are, do a /target blight, and then push your &quot;Interact With Target&quot; keybind. You should get into a pet battle even though you can't see the spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lphomiej</b></h3>I did all the quests that were supposedly required to see &quot;lots&quot; of these around Andorhal. However, there weren't any there when I finished. It was night time... 1am server. I ended up getting a rare one in a battle with a Black Rat. I don't know if that's the best way, but it worked. I'm happy. (That quest line was boring).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>piekid</b></h3>From what these comments say, a lot of people have had success getting this pet after completing the chain. To test it I took every toon of mine to Western Plaguelands and looked around, switching from alt to alt. They are in various stages of the phasing there, from not having quested at all to finishing the chain completely. Over the course of two hours of alt hopping to check phases and flying around looking for spawns, the only character that had no trouble finding anything (including many uncommon and my rare) is the one that had completed every quest <b>except the very last one</b>. I don't know why that is, or if it will work for anyone else. The character I had the worst luck on was the one that fully completed the chain. The rest of them saw a few spawns here and there, from far away, but most of them disappeared with the phase when approached.<br /><br />Long story short, I still don't know if the phasing really matters or not. Like all popular pets, just be patient, battle hard, and you'll get your pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1045606</b></h3>Don't farm the Blighthawk at these locations you will find more than enough farming the black rats up north in Hearthglen. No phasing issues to deal with and the black rats are very commonly paired with the Blighthawk.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>966126</b></h3>After trying for about a week at Andorhal with no luck, I accidentally came across my rare as a second pet. They seem to spawn as seconds to toads in Eastern Plaguelands, by the tiny bit of the Hillsbrad river south of Uther's Tomb. Make sure you stay in the EPL zone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>427762</b></h3>Just quickly verifying - it was MUCH easier just to get these as a secondary pet. I had about a 30% success rate at getting them secondary to other battle critters than finding them as primary. Since the fields around andorhal have several black rats - much easier.<br /><br />I found them secondary to almost anything in the area north of andorhal (mostly black rats are what's around). I also bug reported three terrain stuck ones - one underground near the river, one inside a building &quot;roof&quot; in the alliance side of andorhal, and one in the ground beside one of the crumbling towers (where we used to plant the signal flares.)<br /><br />Easy macro to see if you're targeting one that can't be interacted with:<br />/tar blighthawk<br />/run SetRaidTarget(&quot;target&quot;,1)<br /><br />This will put the lovely yellow diamond marker over it - changing the 1 on the last line will give other marker icons if you have a different preference. Also very useful for things like squirming slime molds and muddy crawfish for dailies - and you can have as many of the /tar lines as desired - if things don't spawn in the same area, you won't have overlap.<br /><br />Hope that helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mormolyce</b></h3>I've completed every quest in this zone and I see no battle pets in Andorhal.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>illiterate</b></h3>This zone is extremely broken. Every pet phases out before you get close to it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cupcakee</b></h3>As of 5.1 JBonezzz is still correct with saying that you need to finish the quest line. I was in Andorhal to pick up a Blighthawk for part of an achievement and only saw one pet spawn. I turned on low-level quests and ended up having to do Ace in the Hole and The Reckoning. After I finished those two and there were no more quests I went out and saw about 10 black rats sitting there. Make sure you've finished the quests there and it should be easier. Also this spawns as a secondary pet to the black rat too so if you don't see any, engage the rats anyway.<br /><br />Edit: Read some of the other comments and can confirm that this does spawn as a secondary all over so it should be easy to get unless you're going for a rare :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TearOfGalaxy</b></h3>One thing, mobs in Andorhal may kill Blighthawk by AOE. I just saw one, but when I was rushing there, it died.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>alpanhell</b></h3>I did all the quests in Andorhal for horde (there were around 6) up to and including the quest that returns you back to the bulwark. Once I had done that I was phased correctly and could get a blighthawk (poor).<br /><br />You'll know you are phased correctly when you no longer see any fighting in Andorhal.<br /><br />Having said that, there are also battle pets here that still seem to phase out and I can't battle (black rats). That suggests different levels of phasing?<br /><br />edit: After doing some more questlines that start in the bulwark I counted 3 (yes 3) more levels of phasing in Andorhal that all end with a quest with Sylvanas. After all that phasing I was finally able to see those black rats that I couldn't fight earlier. But I haven't seen a blighthawk since. It might be because they haven't spawned yet or it might be they are at that 2nd phase. What a mess!<br /><br />edit again: I've started to see blighthawks again in Andorhal so it looks like after going through all the phases you do finally see them. They spawn probably around a 10 min timer and the most I've seen is 2 at a time (though the secondary pet seems to be usually another blighthawk).<br /><br />Just another note - I flew over andorhal around 11:30 PM server time and there must have been 20 blighthawks I could see.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ramrad</b></h3>I thought his ability Consume Corpse is going to be OP. It missed in the last 7 straight battles (same level opponents). Not going to use this pet anymore &gt;.&lt;</div>

I had tried previously a few weeks ago and could only get these as back-up pets on Black Rats, but it looked like a Blighthawk convention was in town tonight :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>933637</b></h3>The Phasing is a problem for pet battlers as mensioned in other comments and it is also true. I tried finding toads and black rats but i could not so i started to circle Andorhal and noticed a few black rats inside but as u go towards them they will phase out, so what i did i located some in the phased area and charges towards it on my mount and if u get it quick enough u can get into battle with it before it phases. I did this and found a blighthawk on the 3rd black rat. :)<br /><br />Hope this helps anyone who coulds find toads or black rats like me :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Draewind</b></h3>I flew over Western Plaguelands to open up the entire map. I saw no battle pets at all, except a squirrel. One near Hearthglenn and one down by Withering Haunt. That is it. Swept the entire zone twice. Fortunately, the one squirrel up by Hearthglenn had a Blighthawk as a secondary.<br /><br />I am not doing a bunch of low level quests, just for the opportunity to grab an average pet. Come on Blizzard, give us a break with all the phasing that is currently part of the game ... especially with the CRZ. Make it so that the battle pets are in all phases.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>879358</b></h3>About phasing:<br /><br />Despite all of the comments to the contrary, blighthawks -will- spawn in all phases. You will only be able to see and battle the blighthawks that are in your current phase of andorhal, but there will be some that spawn every few minutes.<br /><br />From my experience, many can be up at a time, but they spawn slowly (one every 10 minutes or so). If you let them sit a while, you can have a multitude up in andorhal all at once; however, it is rare that they do not get picked off before more than two or three spawn in any given phase.<br /><br />I have tested this on characters that have done no quests at all, that have done a few of the quests, and that have completed the quests in the area. All of them were able to find blighthawks in their respective phases.<br /><br />If you fly by and don't see any, give it a few minutes and try again. If you don't feel like waiting around, blighthawks -do- spawn as secondary battlepets to the black rats in Andorhal and surrounding areas.<br /><br />Finding these little guys is not difficult at all. In my testing, I've found a multitude of uncommon blighthawks. However, finding a rare will prove to be a test of your patience and diligence. Don't expect this to be an easy rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Arktika</b></h3>Ghostly Bite is a good move to use when you know the opponent's next move is Lift-Off, Dive or Burrow and that you'll be going second. <br /><br />This reduces the disadvantage of the stun as any attack would have missed anyway.<br /><br />However, it doesn't cancel the disadvantage entirely, since a defensive move or a buff, along with some other spells (like Cyclone), could be used in the opponent's air/underwater/underground phase.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Silvansaria</b></h3>So there has been a few people address the phasing issue with these battle pets in comments/responses already. In case you don't want to search for them - I decided to add my own for those that do a &quot;Newest First&quot; thread search.<br /><br />The bug is - you can see them appear on your mini map (either a Blighthawk or a Black Rat in the Andorhal area) - but when you get to close they disappear. This is a phasing issue with the area.<br /><br />The way around that is THIS:<br /><br />#1: Bind the &quot;Interact with Target&quot; button (under targeting functions) to a hotkey<br />#2: When you see them appear - KEEP YOUR DISTANCE so they stay on your screen or you'll lose them<br />#3: Target them from a DISTANCE<br />#4: With a flying mount (because of the speed) - hit autorun straight towards them - making sure you hit the ground running - and keep slamming the hotkey (interact with target) and right before they disappear you will enter into a battle with them<br /><br />If you lose them - not to worry - just backup a few paces and they will re-appear on the screen.<br /><br />Hope this helps. I have already submitted a bug report on the issue (as I am sure others have too) - hopefully they will fix it but until THEN - this works.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

It seems rather easy to get as I got an uncommon Blighthawk my second Black Rat fight, if it was luck i'm not sure but I would surely try this before trying the keybind method.<br /><br />- Chow</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sturmgeschut</b></h3>As of legion, it can now also be found in western Bradensbrook near the lighthouse.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>deathlavitz</b></h3>Just encountered one in Val'sharah in the fields of Bradensbrook</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>toomuchwow</b></h3>I know I'm a few years late, but... This achievement must be bugged or something. I went to Western Plaguelands and /love-d a Blighthawk and nothing. So, I came on here looking to see if maybe I had missed something and saw that someone had spotted one in Bradensbrook in Val' sharah. So, I went back to Broken Isles and found one right away (which I was irritated about because I didn't need to leave in the first place), and /love-d that one too. Nothing. It's not working. I know it's not counting because this is the last critter I need for the achievement. Any insight?<br /><br />AH HA! It has to be one that is <b>NOT</b> a battle pet! I thought I was going crazy! Whew! :)</div>
