So the problem in my case was that i was killing  the matriarch or hitting it couple of times and letting others kill it for me(which works) but I had to loot the body too. I did it many times and I couldn't figure out what the problem was and today I did.. For first time today, there were not a lot of people and i killed the matriarch and went to the spot. Again I couldn't see the orphan, so i decided to run back and loot the body. I did that and returned back to the spot and this time (thank god! :D ) i could see the orphan. \nI hope although this is a detail, helps someone having same problem with me.\n\nps.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Protozoa</b></h3>Not sure if there are other spawn locations, but after the Matriarch was killed my group found the orphaned snowfeather at 32,28</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jahjitsu</b></h3>This guy must be bugged. I just spent an hour in the area, downed 3 matriarchs, and checked the location people been posting. The dang snow feather isn't here!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BunnyBennett</b></h3>For whatever reason, this guy isn't always spawning. He is definitely at 32,28 though. I killed the Matriarch 4 times, and FINALLY he spawned at the location. <br /><br />Hope this helps some folks!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bellabosa</b></h3>Confirmed at 32,28. <br /><br />A few points: it <i>WILL NOT</i> show up with a green paw on your minimap. You only need one piece of the Smoked Elderhorn. He can be a bit of a sneaky bugger - read on. <br /><br />Several players had killed the matriarch, run to the confirmed spawn area, and it was not there, even after waiting several minutes. <br /><br />The fix multiple people are reporting to this is to leave the area (I used my flightmaster's whistle to the nearest FP), run back in, re-kill the Matriarch, and then run back to the 32,28. As soon as I did this, he was there waiting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1403911</b></h3>I had to kill 4 or 5 matriarchs before it spawned for me, so perhaps it's just not 100% chance, but it does spawn in the location people have posted. Keep trying haha :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>arshesnei75</b></h3>I was having the same issues where the little guy wouldn't spawn. I had to kill the Matriarch 4 times, the last time, I actually looted the Matriarch and viola, spawn! Not sure if it matters, but it seemed to work for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shelldin</b></h3>Are we positive it's connected to the matriach kill? I think (not 100% sure) it could be something to do with the matriach nest. I killed the matriarch twice but didnt tag the nest and the orphan didnt spawn. i then tried killing it a third time (solo) but got killed. However on this attempt i did kill the nest. and i went to check just for the heck of it and the orphan was there</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>707155</b></h3>This is actually an S/S breed pet so the stats at 25 are 1400 Health 260 Power 325 Speed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TontikBunny</b></h3>I just leveled 25 both of them. (Sharptalon and snowfeather) looks like after complete level 25 quest, it says xxx hatching tired of its advanture and needs some time. No quest appeared, I think we need to wait some time to start quest chain. I will update this post whenever I get the quest.<br /><br />Edit: Quests are daily guys. Confirmed by me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Haitious</b></h3>Not sure if this applies, but currently it almost seems like if someone talks to the hatching before you, it'll despawn rather quickly after. Killed the matriarch, then ran over and a mage had already been there and made an animation like he was interacting with something, when I got close enough nothing spawned at all. This is just a possibility, though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1683999</b></h3>To complete the quest, you have to summon him as a pet &amp; he will have the ? over his head.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pwuebear</b></h3>Use <b>/script print(IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(44879))</b> to check if you are eligble to pick up the hatchling. Return true and you can go to 32,28 to pick it up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kyli</b></h3>I believe you must get the <b><u>killing blow</u></b> on the matriarch to spawn the orphan for you. It is a <u>personal</u> thing.<br /><br />As Pwuebear has posted: <b> /script print(IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(44879))</b> Will tell you if you delivered the final blow.<br /><br />I was having trouble with getting the hatchling to spawn while Solo killing it with a bodyguard. You, and you alone. Must deliver the final blow. (Not sure about class pets, but bodyguards is confirmed to interfere) I killed the matriarch 4 times before I got it the killing blow, which finally popped the script to &quot;true&quot;<br /><br />After that I just ran over to <b>32,28</b> and the adorable thing was sitting right there for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jamie5m</b></h3>For anyone who is struggling to find the orphan. its not a pet, not lootable and doesn't have a green paw over its head. it does NOT spawn near the matriarch. it always spawns at 32,28 from what i have seen. He is kind of hard to see but when you mouse over him an arrow to interact will come up.<br /><br />If he isnt there at 32,28 then just leave the area (i used my whistle) and come back and he will be sitting there waiting.<br /><br />I spent hours killing her over and over looking around the body. Dont make my mistake! lol<br /><br />Happy hunting! :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>RhayelV</b></h3>Today I am unable to summon this pet. I have done up to the quest where you take him to a city and now the summon button is grey and I can't summon him. The others work fine. I just got my 4th today and they all summon fine. Any suggestions?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JusticarCien</b></h3>For any of you who were good with alts in Warlords of Draenor, yet neglected your pet battling! I have exciting news for you!<br />Level 3 Garrisons will allow you to pick up <a href="/item=122457/ultimate-battle-training-stone">Ultimate Battle-Training Stone</a> from <a href="/npc=85418/lio-the-lioness">Lio the Lioness</a>, the quest you need to do is <a href="/quest=38241/unearthed-magic">Unearthed Magic</a>/<a href="/quest=38242/unearthed-magic">Unearthed Magic</a> and only involves you running to the entrance of your Garrison mine. Easy.<br /><br />Just make sure you start the quest for each hatchling on a level 110 character (I say this because my sneaky level 25 stone abuse alts were only 100), and log over to your alt, summon your desired hatchling, and right-click the stone directly on to the summoned baby raptor. Voila. You can complete the quest on the alt if you so desire for some XP.<br /><br />Edit: It may also be worth noting that you can bank your <a href="/item=122457/ultimate-battle-training-stone">Ultimate Battle-Training Stone</a> from <a href="/quest=39042/the-very-best">The Very Best</a> during the Pet Battle Week Holiday if you haven't caught all four hatchlings yet, and if you haven't got stones left from your Garrisons.</div>

They are account-wide quests and the cooldown can be skipped this way.<br /><br />Also, not every waiting period is a day. After turning in the &quot;go to exodar&quot; quest I got the next to kill critters in Azsuna after about an hour.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>QuiSiLoR</b></h3>I got the Snowfeather Hatchling, used a Stone to lv it to 25 for the Quest and completed said Q.<br /><br />However now I cannot seem to start to pick up the dailies ? its been about a day and a half now since I did. I have relogged (obviously), been around all major cities with the pet out in case but I cannot seem to get a follow up Quest.<br /><br />Maybe this is related to a bug using a stone? However if it is then surely it wouldnt have let the quest complete</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Weasei</b></h3>As of Patch 7.1 there are 4 new Falcosaur pets. Each of the pets is associated with a different world quest around the Broken Isles. These pets all provide a quest chain to obtain a different mount. These quest chains require a couple of weeks to complete as each subsequent quest becomes available from your summoned pet after the daily reset after completing the previous quest.<br /><br />To get each pet, you must first kill the Matriarch in the world quest area, which will cause the NPC version of the pet to spawn. The next step is to go to the NPC and interact with it and feed it its favourite food. If you don't have the food, you won't obtain the pet. There are vendors selling the required foods at the closest flightpaths to each world quest for most of these so just remember to pick some up on your way there!<br /><br />Important note on orphans: I've encountered issues with the orphans not spawning after killing the matriarch. This isn't affected by the matriarch's nest but it does seem to be affected by getting the last hit on the matriarch. If you can't see the orphan after killing the matriarch then you may need to wait for the respawn. To check if you have completed the requirements to see the orphan run the scripts below.<br /><br /><b><a href="/npc=115784/snowfeather-hatchling">Snowfeather Hatchling</a></b> - <a href="/quest=44892/snowfeather-swarm">Snowfeather Swarm!</a><br />This pet can be picked up from <a href="/npc=115737/orphaned-snowfeather">Orphaned Snowfeather</a> in Highmountain (/way Highmountain 32.5, 28.2) after killing the <a href="/npc=115673/snowfeather-matriarch">Snowfeather Matriarch</a> (/way Highmountain 35.1, 21.9).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1086596</b></h3>The trigger for the orphaned hatchling to spawn isn't actually the matriarch kill, like everyone is assuming, but <b><u>looting</u></b> the matriarch.<br /><br />I was running the script <b><u>/script print(IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(44879))</u></b> provided by Pwuebear, but even after a third kill, it still returned false and the hatchling hadn't spawn.<br /><br />While waiting for a to matriarch to respawn, I noticed that I didn't loot the previous one, so I did and ran the script again and, to my surprise, it actually came back as true.

Use Crouch, immediately swap to Unborn Val'kyr once it lets you, cast Curse of Doom and Unholy Ascension, this will take enough time that Stampede will be done when your Val'kyr dies. When Val'kyr dies, swap to Spirit Crab, use shell shield, drop whirlpool, and fill with Snap until Splint dies. <br /><br />Hope this helps! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tsotsoleta</b></h3>Hello, <br />This is my first post and i wanted to give a slight information about the way of acquiring this pet, in case someone had same problem with me. I repeatedly went to take this pet having with me the required food, the WQ was available and I was killing the Matriarch and running to the place that was mentioned, but I could never see the orphan. So the problem in my case was that i was killing the matriarch or hitting it couple of times and letting others kill it for me(which works) but I had to loot the body too. I did it many times and I couldn't figure out what the problem was and today I did.. For first time today, there were not a lot of people and i killed the matriarch and went to the spot. Again I couldn't see the orphan, so i decided to run back and loot the body. I did that and returned back to the spot and this time (thank god! :D ) i could see the orphan. <br />I hope although this is a detail, helps someone having same problem with me.<br /><br />ps. I didn't experience the same problem and have to loot the body of the matriarch for other pets you can obtain from Swarms WQs</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>raiders1989</b></h3>I have been able to actually talk to it on 3 different toons and every time I do, it goes away without my actually learning him and then I cannot find him again no matter how many times I kill the Matriarch. WTF? And yes, I had the right food with me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1683999</b></h3>Can you only have ONE snowfeather?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>nomsidious</b></h3>There are two things that everyone needs to be aware of<br /><br />1. Be sure your battle pet limit is not maxed,because if it is you cannot learn the pet and be sure you have the correct food on you before going. <br /><br />2. No matter what anyone tells you, do not complete the world quest before going after the orphaned pet. Every time I tried it that way there was no pet to be found. If you want the easiest way to complete this, kill nothing. Look up on Wowhead where the Matriarch is and go kill ii and loot the corpse. Next go directly to where the orphaned hatchling is and feed it it's favorite food. Once you confirm you learned it, go finish the world quest. If you run this #showtooltip Bloodgazer Hatchling;Snowfeather Hatchling;Direbeak Hatchling; Sharptalon Hatchling/summonpet 115787;;115784;115785;115786 provided by xxPenCapxx and the one you killed comes back as false, you need to kill the Matriarch again. <br /><br />By not killing anything else, you have room to kill the Matriarch as needed to get a true and feed the orphaned hatchling to get it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SylviaDragon</b></h3>You can complete the objectives on your main then turn them in on a low level character and <b>the xp will not scale.</b><br />without heirlooms its roughly 16k xp per quest regardless of the characters level. with my full set of looms (minus the rings, still missing them) it came to about 24k xp per quest. So if you have been wanting an alt but are not looking forward to the first few levels/starting zones this is a great way to boost yourself to a decent level while keeping your alt on a back burner for later.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Muchomurka</b></h3>All those hatchlings are Unique, so you can obtain only one of each species! Even if you kill Matriarch and feed orphan on your alt, you wont receive another pet!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Telkari</b></h3>I wanted to share my experience with having killed the Matriarch several times, yet the hatchling never spawned. I ALWAYS loot EVERYTHING, I never not loot things. So when I read that people were able to get the hatchling to spawn by looting her corpse, I was confused. I did loot her, and my /script print(IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(44879)) always came back false. I did notice, however, that every time I had killed the Matriarch, other people had come running in to tag her as well, and always brought a bunch of other shi-...trash with them. Then of course they all loved their AoE spam to quickly kill all the things while they are there for the WQ, leaving a pile of bodies around her that get looted as well.<br /><br />So if you're like me, and you have auto loot on that loots EVERY corpse, here are a few different ways you can get the loot &quot;trigger&quot; to change it from false to true:<br /><br />1: have more dps than everyone and burst her down before trash dies, too, so you have a chance to loot only her body<br />2: when all the AoE trash dies, take aggro or if you have aggro, kite her a distance away from the bodies so they don't autoloot.<br />3: temporarily turn auto loot off, and loot JUST her body alone first, then turn it back on to loot the rest.<br /><br />I noticed once I had looted her, AND ONLY HER, the script turned from false to true, and I was finally able to get the orphan.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>matt4077</b></h3>Forgive me if this is already mentioned in a previous comment. I was able to acquire the Snowfeather Hatchling without killing the Matriarch or any combat. I flew into the area. World Quest appeared. I happened to be by the Feltotem Cavern and the orphan was running around. I had the correct food item in my bag so on a whim, I interacted with the little guy and he appeared in my pet journal. Again, this happened before I completed any combat but I did have the active World Quest.</div>

He's almost all the way to Feltotem, atop a little hill near a cave, Feltotem Caverns. When you get close, he 'erks' in your dialogue box. Hope this saves someone else a lot of time!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Adrella</b></h3>Summoning my snowfeather today resulted in a confusing quest marker for the quest to level it to 25. I completed all four questlines sometime during Legion and have summoned this pet on this character before without the quest showing up. I went ahead and finished it, so I suppose I'll see if the next quest shows up tomorrow. I checked the rest of the falcosaurs and none of them gave the quest.<br /><br />UPDATE: No new quest. Just a random bug.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Martika</b></h3>As of today, I finished the first quest in the chain for this pet (leveling to 25) and then switched to two other toons above lvl 110 and they were NOT able to pick up the second quest. I don't know if that means it has been &quot;fixed&quot; and you can't do as many quests in the chain in one day as possible with various characters, or if this is just a momentary glitch?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aedna</b></h3>If these pets won't give you their quests once you've acquired them, you probably haven't learned pet battling. This can be learned from the pet battle trainer in Stormwind or Orgrimmar. I didn't get the quest for weeks, opened a ticket and this is what a gamemaster told me to do. Upon learning pet battling, I had to relog, and once I logged in they offered me the quest!</div>
