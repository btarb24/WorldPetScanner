<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>720256</b></h3>I also found them in the Eastern Plaguelands as level 12, but also as secondary pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>These spiders are some of the time-related pets. They can be found anywhere that the widow spiders show up, but only at night (or, apparently, in secondary battles). In appearance, they look exactly like what they sound like: small black widow spiders. When clicked, they make a soft, 'squshy' insectoid sound.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Firyion</b></h3>This pet can be found only during the nighttime, either as a secondary pet in a battle or... and this is just a bug right now I suppose - stuck under tree textures around Twilight Grove in Duskwood and I couldn't click on him, since he was obstructed. <br />Was trying to find one as secondary, but I wasn't lucky enough, so I just made a macro:<br />&quot;/tar Widow Spiderling&quot; and then run around the tree spamming 'Interact with target' key bind, then you will start a battle and be able to catch that Lil bastard ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Anarchangel</b></h3>Fairly certain &quot;nighttime&quot; refers to server time, as there were no spawns anywhere pre-8pm server time, then a ton all of a sudden at 8:01<br /><br />Found 10-15 in the locations noted as primary combatants</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>annasender</b></h3>Found in the middle of the day today in Duskwood, so wasn't limited to nighttime. It was the 2nd foe when I battled a Dusk Spiderling.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1035251</b></h3>I saw this as a primary pet. I wanted to check it out, as it suddenly said 'Widow Spiderling' instead of the usuals, but as it was stuck in a tree I had to take it out using Fan of Knives...<br /><br />I'm still searching for it again, as it seems to be kind of rare. All the Dusk Spiderlings are together with Mouse, Black Rat and all oher kind of Duskwood virmin..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mcdisney2001</b></h3>NOT limited to the night time; I just caught this at 4:45 PM server time. It was secondary to a Dusk Spiderling.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>850778</b></h3>Found one as a secondary pet when I attacked a mouse... Accidentally killed it. Argh!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sandybeach16</b></h3>Was on tonight and several of them spawned at 8:00 pm server time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jeolene</b></h3>So, I've been wondering if blizz has the times skewed a bit on these. Like others have posted, I too have seen them during the day, though not as much as during the night, but they do spawn. I did notice just tonight, there were NONE spawning after 1am (I live in Michigan) and only found them as secondary pets, I talked to other people and they noticed the same thing, they couldn't find any. Anyone else noticed them not spawning after certain times at night or is it just a coincidence?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Heimdallen</b></h3>My best advice for finding one of these is to search in Brightwood Grove - I ran around all over the area east of the Raven Hill Cemetery where they supposedly hang out, and after 2 hours of basically non-stop battling anything I could find, I only found one of these as a secondary combatant to a rat snake. And accidentally one shot it. Ha. Moved to Brightwood, and even with several people there also actively seeking these out, I was able to find and battle a half dozen or so in 10 or 15 minutes time. I can't even confirm they spawn at ALL as primaries near Raven Hill. This was at night time, of course, but I still recommend starting with Brightwood first. Oh, and the one in the tree is still there as of 11/11/12.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nyssea</b></h3>I just found one as a secondary to a Dusk Spiderling. It was 8:40 am server time, but with CRZ who knows what time it actually was.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shaid</b></h3>I've only found two of these. Unfortunately they were both inside trees.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>killertofu</b></h3>Found a rare one by the road near of Raven Hill. It was hiding behind a dusk spiderling that was poor quality. Happy to find it since I had been farming it for about an hour! Happy Farming!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1069318</b></h3>Was able to find this during the day as a secondary pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1069551</b></h3>I read the posts on this little guy and decided to try finding him through secondary battles during the day. I battled a dozen or so Dusk Spiderlilngs and the Widow Spiderling never showed up as a secondary. I logged out and came back at 8:20 pm server time and tried again. I still did not have any luck. Then, suddenly at 8:31 pm server time the area exploded with Widow Spiderlings. While it may seem like it is dark in Duskwood all the time,somehow these little arachnids know when the sun sets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jediev</b></h3>Time is Really not a Factor for it being a secondary Battler. I just had one at 11:38 am CST as a secondary. I only saw them one the world map around 10-11pm CST.<br /><br />I think they are like the Harpy Younglings, once they spawn and are fought/killed they won't spawn again till the next day. because I flew around all night trying to fight more and there was only Dusk Spiderling and people were Fighting them all trying to get the Widow last night</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>42855</b></h3>Ignore the time requierment (as mentioned previously). <br /><br />Get it as a secondary in the zone at any time. <br /><br />I got mine at 9 in the morning secondary from a skunk.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>XeonXarid</b></h3>They also spawn as secondaries on the Dusk Spiderlings as well</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gealex</b></h3>These comments are all outdated. I spent hours in the area, the only free Widow Spiderling was locked inside a tree. There have been a few others as secondary pets, but none blue, and very rare all the same.<br />It is a very difficult to get pet, as it almost never appears even if it is after 10pm or before 6am server time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Chekan</b></h3>Cant say for sure about spawn time, but i definately caught the <b>despawn</b> time -<b> 5:30 AM</b>. I came there at 5:29 and i saw like 5 of them on the map, then 5:30 hit and all despawned.<br /><br />And i was alone there ofcourse.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>d0ttie308</b></h3>Found a rare as secondary pet 8pm Server</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kittay</b></h3>I actually just came across one right now (14:00 server time) so I'm confused. It's listed as a &quot;Night&quot; pet, but 2pm is definitely not night. Anyone have an idea? It was the first pet btw, together with a rat snake as secondary.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>342007</b></h3>I have just now came across one of these as a secondary to a rat snake and it is 12:37pm CST at 54, 22.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>nettopeer</b></h3>Just caught it at 12:20 PM server time, as secondary for dusk spiderling. 3rd battle.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>976880</b></h3>Just found one (rare, even) as a primary pet at 7.32PM server time on Bloodfeather-EU. Maybe it's a daylight saving time bug, but I'm not complaining :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Stargazer777</b></h3>I scoured the area for a couple hours battling every pet on the shelf east of Raven Hill Cemetery, and did not see a single one, even as a secondary pet. Then at exactly 7:30 p.m. server time, a ton of them popped, and I was able to battle about 10 of them, even with competition farming them. Then they all disappeared about 20 minutes later.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Suuckamedrya</b></h3>I showed up at 6:30pm server time and again at 7:30pm server time, both times I flew around the areas they are supposed to spawn for roughly twenty minutes and none spawned. I also tried battling dusk spiderlings and other battle pets in the area and did not see them as secondaries either (battled about 30 or so pets in the area). <br /><br />I'll come back at 9:30pm just in case they are spawning at 6:30pm PST like the Restless Shadelings now spawn at midnight PST. I'll update this with a yay or a nay afterwards.<br /><br />- So it's confirmed, <b><u>They now spawn at 6:30pm PST aka 9:30pm EST now</u></b> also, if you are planning to go there trying to find one as a secondary pet, don't go thinking it's going to be super easy like I did. I saw all the comments on here like &quot;it was soooo easy to find them as secondary pets, only took me three pet battles to find one&quot; and got my hopes up when in reality I pet battled again and again and again for over an hour with absolutely no widow spiderlings showing up as secondaries.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lichee</b></h3>So many people have said this but not in 1 post and nothing I've seen about the pet battle area being obscured so here it is:<br />If you see one in a tree, set up a keybind in the Key Bindings menu under the Targeting Functions section. <br /><br />Then do a /tar widow in the chat window and it will target the widow spiderling. <br /><br />Hit your new keybind and if it says pet battle area is obscured, turn your character around so that your back is facing the tree trunk.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>IMissThottbot</b></h3>I am not getting any as secondary pets during the day. There WERE some up as primaries, left over from night (they don't seem to simply despawn) but as none were Rare, I kept hunting. <br /><br />After clearing out most of the Duskwood pet battles, I think I can safely say that they no longer spawn as Secondaries during the day--that or I am extremely unlucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Stizelswik</b></h3>It's really not fair to us who work nights and can't play all the time... that some pets only spawn at night. Just sayin'.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1346083</b></h3>I cant say for certain but i think this is the only spide with the destrution breed... got mine a few days ago, rare destruction</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>andrearochel</b></h3>I know this is suppose to be a time related pet (night time). I found mine as a primary in Duskwood at 10:06am server time. It was the only one and I searched and searched. I even battled others looking to find it as a secondary pet. <br /><br />Coords were 34.38/50.11<br /><br />I am sure your chances will be better at night, maybe I just got lucky. <br /><br />Happy hunting! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lizonya</b></h3>I see a lot of comments speculating on this, so I'd like to clarify:<br /><br /><b>&quot;Night&quot; is 9PM to 9AM Pacific Time <u>NOT</u> server time.</b><br /><br />While these can be found during the day as secondaries, they're all over the place during the above mentioned nighttime, so it's easier to farm the correct breed (P/P or GTFO) at night.<br /><br />Pro Tip: These tricksy little buggers like to spawn in trees sometimes (like a third of the time, so pretty commonly) so you can see them on your minimap but can't click to target them. If you create a &quot;/target Widow Spiderling&quot; macro and set a key binding for &quot;Interact With Target&quot; you can use them together to get the ones that are hiding. Keep in mind that once you target one, you may need to move around a little while spamming your Interact bind (mouse scroll is a good bind for this) until it stops saying &quot;Pet battle area is obstructed.&quot;<br /><br /><b>Happy hunting! =)</b><br /><br />Edit: P/P &quot;correct breed&quot; comment relates to my preferred Xu-Fu strat for Celestial Tournament. The easiest way to 2-pet him (for elekk plushie achieve) is with a fox/worg (Dazzling Dance &gt; Bite &gt; Howl) followed by a P/P spider (Brittle Webbing &gt; Spiderling Swarm). <b>Other spiders available with correct moveset and breed: <a href="/npc=62117/twilight-spider">Twilight Spider</a> and <a href="/npc=65054/feverbite-hatchling">Feverbite Hatchling</a>.</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cajun06</b></h3>I just found a widow spiderling at server time 10:30 am, just northwest of Vul'Gol Ogre Mound, south of the main road. I couldn't believe I found one so early in the day, although poor quality.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Atraira</b></h3>Spawned at 9:30 PM EST / 6:30 PM PST for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sirloper</b></h3>These do only spawn at night. More, the &quot;server time&quot; doesn't seem to respect Daylight Saving Time, so in the winter, &quot;night&quot; is 9pm where it's 8pm in the summer (server time). Also, the sun visibly sets in game, which you can watch if you can fly above the tree line.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>paupau</b></h3>Just found one at 36/62 and it is 1:57pm. No needed to wait at night time.</div>
