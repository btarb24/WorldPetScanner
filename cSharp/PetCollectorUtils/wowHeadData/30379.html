The feed is obtained for alliance in westfall from <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=233">this guy</a> or horde at brill from <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=33996">this guy</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kaley115</b></h3>This one was a little confusing for me. After browsing numerous websites this is what I've found. The chickens are found in westfall. Saldean, the guy who has the drinks and food for the area, has the &quot;special feed&quot; you'll need. Click on a chicken and keep saying /chicken until he gives you a quest. I recommend waiting a second or two in between each post because there is a delay before the the chicken gives the quest. I had to to do it on a few different chickens and type /chicken about 80 times, but it eventually showed up! I already had a sack of feed in my bag so I finished the quest right then and there. I got the egg, opened it, and got my westfall chicken. Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>thaia</b></h3>Worked for me with a non-battlepet chicken. Turn off sound if you want to keep your sanity. (Never noticed before that Pandaren had two sounds for /chicken. One sounds more like a question, actually...)<br /><br />Sadly, after I accepted the quest, my chicken was still attackable. So when I right-clicked it, instead of handing over the Special Chicken Feed, I.... KILLED it! D: <br />Was very depressed, I had gotten kind of emotionally attached to it after spending minutes making chicken sounds at it. :( <br />Had to abandon the quest and start all over. Second time everything worked fine. Remember, you have to loot the egg off the ground after the quest is completed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BeerGuy</b></h3>June 17 2014 - I just /chicken my way into another pet. This quest/acquisition for a battle pet is still available and working. It was a tad annoying how long I flapped my arms and strutted around these chickens, but it still works!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>965924</b></h3>Took me about 20 minutes to get this guy. Made a macro and sat around waiting for it to pop. Just takes time and patience.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MrDiamondJ</b></h3>Just chiming in to confirm that this still works. I did this on the chickens in Westfall over in Moonbrook by the Deadmines. /chicken a bunch of times while targeting a Chicken (make sure it's one of the non-pet versions so somebody can't come by and battle it out from under you), the chicken turns green (eventually), accept the quest and get the Special Chicken Feed from Saldean's Farm. Come back to the chicken to turn it in, and then click on the chicken to get the egg that spawns the almighty Westfall Chicken, Scourge of the Henhouse.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MRTF</b></h3>You can spam the macro on the same chicken. And there's no need to be afraid on overspamming it, the chicken wont reset.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>RavenBHK</b></h3>GUIDE 6.2<br /><br />Step 1: Buy special chicken feed (23 copper) from William Saldean &lt;Grain &amp; Feed Vendor&gt;. <br /><br />Step 2: Cast /chicken x 100 on a NORMAL chicken (NON-BATTLE PET) <br /><br />Step 3: After a while the chicken will give you a quest CLUCK. <br /><br />Step 4: Then you go to your chicken and type /cheer. And turn in. The chicken will lay an egg you have to loot. Click the egg and you receive the battle pet. <br /><br />N.B Don't waste your time casting /chicken on a battle pet. Nothing will ever happen. Learn from my mistake.<br />N.B.B Don't eat the food like I did in front of chicken. Chicken won't give you an egg. <br />N.B.B.B If your chicken died cause someone killed it for &quot;LOLz&quot; there are more chickens at Solliden Farmstead</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Averyce</b></h3>I did this today 9/9/16 for Horde. I used a chicken at Solliden Farm in Trisfal. I spammed my /chicken macro for 30 minutes and nothing happened. I switched to the /flap macro, and got it within 100 clicks. I was able to complete the quest 3 times before the quest despawned. ( i had pre-purchased the feed)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pleutana</b></h3>Can confirm. Takes forever but it worked. Sat flapping at a chicken (after seeing another comment I changed the macro to /flap) while a farmhand keeps missing me with his pitchfork. <br />Also: another vote for turning sound off. I can still hear it, even though I've stopped. ARGH!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tie35</b></h3>This really isn't as hard as others make it sound. You got get special chicken feed from the special feeds farmer in Brill if you're Horde or Westfall if your Alliance. You find a non battle pet chicken in either of these 2 areas, Trisfal glades for Horde and Westfall for Alliance. I have the add on Rarity so it shows me on my map where the spots are to get the chickens. You make a macro /chicken. Select the chicken and spam the macro. While spamming the macro, WATCH UR CHAT BOX. As soon as it say 'THE CHICKEN LOOKS UP AT YOU QUIZZICALLY, MAYBE YOU SHOULD INSPECT IT' stop spamming and there is your quest. The quest will require you to feed the chicken the special feed. The chicken will lay and egg represented by a cogwheel. I would suggest you zoom ur map in some so you can see it better. Click the cogwheel and boom... there's your pet. <br /><br />** I was able to click the quest twice before it despawned and got 2 eggs. You can use the same chicken to get the quests again if you not satisfied with the chicken you got. You will need more than on sack of the special chicken feed to complete the quest more than once.</div>
