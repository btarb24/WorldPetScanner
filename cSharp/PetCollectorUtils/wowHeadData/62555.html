<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>526086</b></h3>As a pet battle enthusiast, I have to say so far this is one of the better pets I've battled with.<br /><br />He packs a very versatile kit, has a decent heal on attack, and Reflection has incredible potential.<br /><br />One thing: Be careful against flying attacks. If you Reflection against something like that causes you to fly, he will stay in &quot;flight&quot; forever and be unattackable. Very cheesy.<br /><br />EDIT: Also a good choice if you're looking for something to counter Dragons.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>clarkeyboy</b></h3>The blue version of this pet is one of the more powerful to use, due to it having Reflect, coupled with it's 3 turn Rampage, it's killing most same level 25 pets before they can even hit it. Seems to also have a very high dodge chance too.<br /><br /><b>*UPDATE 5.2*</b><br />The pet lost alot of it's usability with the Reflect nerf, still strong attacks, and the humanoid racial helps, but no longer a stand out top of the line pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sykoo</b></h3>I found to have better luck with these spawning really early in the morning or very late at night. Early morning there was around 3 - 5 up at a time where as later on at night (11ish or so) there was at least 10 or more. I cleared the zone out and by my 7th one It as a rare. He is now level 25 and he is awesome. Best Humanoid pet I have by far.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>847309</b></h3>As appears to be the case with many of the &quot;low spawn rate but no special spawn condition&quot; pets, it seems possible to get one of these to spawn by killing or battling the other battle pets in the zone. <br /><br />In my own experience, I flew the spawn area for these several times and saw nothing. I then left and outright killed about 10 or so battle pets, went back up the spawn area and, lo and behold, a Flayer Youngling. It was poor quality, but it counts for the unique pet capture achievement just the same.<br /><br />Happy Hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Chibchub123</b></h3>If you kill a pet you are trying to tame, (so long as it isn't the last pet in the line-up) log out, then back in. It will still be avaliable to re-battle. I just had a lucky crit (un-lucky crit) that killed the only one of these I'd seen, so I logged. When I got back, the same critter, the same level, the same secondary pets, and the same quality was there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ganteving</b></h3>Ok as to this being a rare spawn...no. The area this guys spawns in, he is the only pet. The real issue is he takes about <s>30 min</s> or so to spawn. Also he has 4 spawn points (that I can tell) and can have up to 3 of these guys up at once (most I have found at least). I think the hardest part about getting this guy is if other players are around, which will possibly pull you into a shared realm. <br /><br />Edit: Spawn rate has been changed. This guy is fairly simple to get now and greens are not a big deal, blues are still annoying to find though (at least for me).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1051185</b></h3>For those of you who haven't leveled your battle pets enough to capture these on the Terrokar/Hellfire border, they can also be found on Bloodmyst Isle. They are probably the most common battle pet to be found there, although they are sparsley scattered. I recommend taming there because there is a lot less competition and fewer bugging issues (I had a rare hatchling in the Oulands location bug in flying position so that it was unhittable...very frustrating). Good luck and happy hunting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>CircleofHealing</b></h3>Follow the red/green border in your mini map between Terrokar Forest and Hellfire Peninsula in your mini map.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aalyy</b></h3>I can confirm that killing the large Flayers in the area causes the Younglings to spawn. Don't just sit there and wait for a spawn, kill stuff!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>fortki</b></h3>The high speed stat version of the Flayer Youngling seems to be the best since his Kick ability will stun and skip your opponents turn. A free heal for being human and delays a turn for your reflect to come back up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>760141</b></h3>I accidentally found this guy as I was flying through Outland. He was on the ridge, just happened to notice on my mini-map, and went back for him. Barely got him, as I landed I got swarmed by campers. As luck would have it, he was a rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>38308</b></h3>I logged in at 4:55am server time and battled 23 (twenty-three) that were all spawned at the same time in hopes of a rare. They were close enough together I didn't have to mount up between battles.<br /><br />I double counted the battles from my pet-battle log so I know that number is accurate. It has been 15 minutes now and no new spawns are up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ikayuro</b></h3>After trying to get one of these for awhile, they finally spawned for me - a lot of them! - at about 4:00 am server. The shelf was crawling with them, and managed to get a rare after a couple kills. They are found on the razorthorn rise, NOT the razorthorn shelf! Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>668287</b></h3>This guy went from overpowered in 5.0.5 (especially with reflection bugging on some abilities, like burrow), to rather broken in 5.1 - reflection no longer reflects many special enemy attacks, making it a wasted move half the time. To add insult to injury, it also lost the visual for reflection!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Neiara</b></h3>Found a ton of them this morning around 9:50 am... there was one other person there and I saw five of them, not sure how many he had already went through.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ukjl</b></h3>Hi all,<br /><br />I have just spent an hour farming the Flayer and the results are as follows:<br /><br />Server time when started 11:10am, Thursday 6th December 2012.<br /><br />I spent 30mins just flying up and down the Razorthorn Rise and came across 4 Flayers (3 grey and 1 white).<br /><br />I then started to kill the adds on the Razorthorn Rise and come across 8 Flayers (4 grey, 2 white, 1 green and 1 blue).<br /><br />Iâ€™m not sure if farming the adds helped or is connected to the increase in spawning Flayers but Iâ€™m happy with my Level 17 Rare Flayer....!<br /><br />If youâ€™re a skinner you will come away with a lot of Knothide Leather too.<br /><br />Good luck all</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ShadowpriestSB</b></h3>Alternatively you could do what I did.... I was flying around for about 15 minutes when I noticed that, not only was there no pets to battle in the area, there were a lot of dead flayers (lending credence to the kill mobs to spawn pet theory). I did another much faster loop as I realized someone was in the zone and found a 90 rogue <br /> When I flew up to the rogue to investigate, I saw a flayer youngling pet! I instantly attacked the rogue and he actually ran off without much of a fight. To my surprise the youngling was a RARE!<br />First try! I know it is lucky, but I believe the killing mobs to respawn pets is the way to go.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1063694</b></h3>True and correct posts about being found on the ledge between Terrokar Forrest and Hellfire Peninsula (where all the Flayer mobs roam) I don't know if I was really lucky or what, but every Flayer Youngling I came across was Uncommon, the first first I lost due to having the wrong set of pets against him.. The team I put together that won me two Uncommons (green) were my:<br /><br />UNDEAD Infected Squirrel (Level 15/Rare)<br />BEAST Festering Maggot (Level 15/Uncommon)<br />UNDEAD Infected Fawn (Level 13/Rare)<br /><br />Out of three separate battles, two times the Flayer Youngling brought with him a Snake/Squirrel combo, and the third time I was against him and 2 skunks, all ranging from level 18-19.<br /><br />The respawn rate seems to be quite immediate.. as soon as battle completed another appeared nearby. <br />It's true.. if you accidentally kill him- just log out right away (in the middle of the battle) and when you return, he will be right there (same exact level/team with him)<br /><br />Hope this helps!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>icon01</b></h3>What i did to get a fast spawn was to kill the large Razorthorn Flayer npcs don't know if that caused it or not but had 2 spawn under 20 mins 1 was uncommon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mistfeather</b></h3>*Sighs*<br /><br />Took me hours to run across one, when I finally did, I got it down to near where I should have been able to cage it, but still couldn't. Chose my pet's weakest blow, should've done only 200 damage and allowed me to cage. It critical hit for over 325 and killed the stupid thing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>entropos</b></h3>I don't think these things exist. I resent the complicated efforts you all have made to make it look like you've found and tamed this non-existent creature. <br /><br /><b>And I hate all of you. </b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Triffy</b></h3>My 2cents ; people seem to be having a problem finding them, the easiest way I can think of describing the area - anyone whom ever played BC and did all the shattered sun faction dailies , the younglings are in the exact same location as <a href="/quest=11520/discovering-your-roots">Discovering Your Roots</a> (Discovering your roots)<br /><br />P.S. They're tough buggers , have a suitable lvl beasty to take them on. GL</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1031618</b></h3>Map is correct on wowhead. <br />I had to camp a bit to find two (one for my friend). From my camping experience I would say that only <b>one</b> spawns at a time, could be wrong, like on the other &quot;rare&quot; pets. <br />Remember to zone-in-out a few time to see other CRZs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>718734</b></h3>Yay captured it twice it was a rare, horde attacked me 3 times, he died 3 times, got pissed cause he was bad so he killed the pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sinthuja</b></h3>Look! It's Scyther! Quickly, catch him!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>EmyP</b></h3>Just a point for those taming as they level - the mobs here are level 71... ;) <br /><br />My level 66 mage says ouch ouch ouch!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1068569</b></h3>Got there around 8:40 pm server time. I'm using a team of all rare lvl 22s: cockroach, creepy crate, stripe-tailed scorpid. I only found 1 there.<br /><br />Poor<br />LvL: 19<br />HP: 716<br />Speed: 143<br />Att: 152<br />Brought a rat and a stripe-tailed scorpid to the fight.<br /><br />I am a rare collector, so I decided to test the theory that killing mobs prompts pet spawning. I can confirm that the mobs average lvl 70, but being a lvl 76 hunter with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=50759">Iriss the Widow</a> as a pet, it was just mad slaughter for XP as I gleefully murdered my way through the Razorthorn Rise. Unfortunately, other than an opportunity to practice my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRamB30E9mU" rel="nofollow">Vincent Price Evil Cackle</a> as ichor and body parts flew everywhere, there was no effect, certainly no pet spawning. I went ahead and slaughtered my way through the Rise again though, because, you know, Evil Cackle.<br /><br />I'll just be satisfied with my poor version until I can find another upgrade stone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>662743</b></h3>farming there for a rare...everytime I get there I find at least 20 or so..never a rare but lots of uncommons.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Entilzha2161</b></h3>Unlike most pets which have male and female breeds, according to <a href="http://petsear.ch/Breeds" rel="nofollow">http://petsear.ch/Breeds</a> Flayer Younglings only have male breeds, meaning there's only one version of the max dps version that does 325 damage at 25 rare. It seemed to take me A LOT more then 10 younglings to find the right breed, so if you come across one, catch it regardless of the quality for when you have a stone to use on it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Breakability</b></h3>I caught mine on Razorthorn <i>Rise</i>, <b>not </b>Razorthorn Shelf. The Shelf will zone you over the Hellfire, and you want to be in Terokkar to catch this little guy. I only saw only one and was lucky to get an uncommon. Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Moshella</b></h3>Flayer Youngling's <b>Reflection</b> has now been changed to <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=490"><b>Deflection</b></a>. <br /><br />A <i>huge</i> nerf in my opinion. <i>Oh well, at least it still looks cool...</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thecanman</b></h3>This pet is great for taking out Critters. You get the best of both worlds here; Humanoid (takes less damage from critters) and with beast abilities (deals more damage to critters). Use this pet's beast attacks then watch it cut through critter pets like a knife through warm butter.<br /><br />Also, don't bother with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=426">Focus</a>, use <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/petability=490">Defelction</a> instead. The pet has no high-damage, low hit chance ability to compliment it (like <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=159">Burrow</a>), making it redundant. Use it to defend your pet against those sort of abilities instead.<br /><br />You won't find these things in Hellfire Peninsula (like what the in-game journal says), but instead, they're up on a mountain range in Terrokar Forest, right on the border of Hellfire Peninsula.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mewmewface</b></h3>spent hours on my horde server chogall at about 5:25 PM PST, i went to my alliance alt on tichondrius and there were 2 spawns , both poor, i took them both. Razorthorn Rise.<br /><br />probably gonna use the rare stone for this..i mean just waiting for a spawn took literally forever what more if i have to hunt for an uncommon or rare..eek.<br /><br />have to add that once i got this pet , when i logged on to a parked toon on my horde i saw 1 battle pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Evelosia</b></h3>Around 5:45 Eastern Time - Friday Evening - I caught an uncommon (Green) Flayer Youngling. It was my second try - First time I got a common (white) one. Gonna try a couple more times to see if I can get a blue :)<br /><br />5:58 Eastern Time - Same Friday Evening - I spot a blue... and got him!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1186349</b></h3>I did not find any single pet in that area... can it be a bug or something?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>smetia</b></h3>You can find them gest in Razorthorn Rise i went in the morning and found a whole bunch a of them i took a guardian and upgrade it with a stone.<br /><br /> During the active day you find any beacause other people wants them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mcjkaiser</b></h3>I concur with my fellow wow players that it is in Razorthorn Rise in Terrokar Forest Zone, or at least thats what it read on the map. The coords read 52,12 but just make sure you are in the Terrokar Forest zone otherwise if your in Hellfire Peninsula then obviously it would read a different number. I only saw one in the whole area and i was happy it was at least uncommon but would have preferred a rare but nothing a battle stone can't solve, Hope this helps and good luck in your search in finding whatever it is your looking for,</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>grundge</b></h3>This pet could be so much better, but in its current state it isn't anything to write home about. <br /><br />Deflection is a nice skill and combined with Kick it would make for a great strategy to use when you are trying to avoid being hit. Like when using the apocalypse strategy, BUT the speed on this pet is so low it would never work (you need to go first to get the stun in the Kick to work).<br /><br />This pet needs a strong attack to make it good or better speed stats considering two of its attacks are based on fast speed. Ah well, at least it looks cool</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>GoRozZo</b></h3>Actually, this pet can win solo 1x3 in pvp of three 25 lvls. <a href="/npc=62555/flayer-youngling">Flayer Youngling</a> and <a href="/npc=65203/emperor-crab">Emperor Crab</a> also can do it solo tbh. If you interesting you can watch my video where i showed 1x3 win by one pet.<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYEDpfrAcSQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYEDpfrAcSQ</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mking52</b></h3>Got to the spawn place about 5:15pm EST 4:15p server and they were there but they were all dead. Which made me mad. Looked like maybe someone had gone threw and just killed them all. I cried a little inside.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kitten</b></h3>Got one of these 0208/2014. Was there almost an hour and only saw one the whole time. It was poor quality, but I had to take it. I did catch it in terrokar, not hellfire, just like everyone said. Managed to get a flawless battle stone drop the first mob while leveling it in frostfire ridge.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wyndbreaker</b></h3>As of 7/24/2016 the zoning issue appears to be fixed. Had no trouble finding plenty of these.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Grammie</b></h3>a ton @ 58.26, 12.25 @ 5:08 pm server time right on the razorthorn shelf</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Reroma</b></h3>As of 3/17/18 at around 2:45am EST on Wyrmrest Accord, there's like loads of these and I got 2 of the breeds I wanted in one shot. Not rare quality but that's always just a stone away.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Georgino</b></h3>Located at Razorthorn Rise which is the forest at Terrokar/Hellfire borders.<br />There are around <b>20 of them</b> up at the same moment but their <b>respawn time seems to be 2-3 hours.</b><br />If you are hunting a rare make sure to check/kill each one of these and then come back after 2-3 hours for next try (Assuming you are the only one who farming these nowdays)<br />It took me <b>98 attempts</b> to finally catch my rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tesriel</b></h3>Having a character that knows flying on a low-pop server can help a lot. Especially if you want a specific breed.</div>
