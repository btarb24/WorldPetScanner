<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tarax</b></h3>Just to note.. you loose quite a bit of area if you complete the quests as an alliance in the moonwater retreat area. It CRZ's to no coral adders after you finish the final quests with the Pearlfin village guys. You can get right on the boundaries and see quite a few, but as soon as you go into the area they disappear.. Has been very aggravating. I was able to snag one who got to close, but I have yet to find more than a poor.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mini2904</b></h3>must have been lucky, when i got there 3 spawns was up</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>These will spawn as secondaries in the Timeless Isle, as well, whereas on the mainland they are primary-only.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Alaurynn</b></h3>As of Patch 5.4, the best place to farm this pet is on Timeless Isle. Instead of wasting your time trying to force a spawn on the primary pet in Bamboo Wilds, just go to Timeless Isle and battle any pet you find there. The Coral Adder spawns as a secondary pet frequently. They do NOT spawn as a primary on Timeless Isle, only as a secondary.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>934546</b></h3>Found a rare one in Timeless Isle 50.16, 64.26.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>995652</b></h3>If you wipe out all pets that do not carry a Coral Adder in Jade Forest you will eventually get them to spawn. I had about 5-6 spawn (one rare) as the PRIMARY pet. This seems contrary to some of the posts about them only being seconday pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Poisonfrog13</b></h3>I found about 10 of these tonight spawned by a little pond north of the words &quot;Moonwater Retreat&quot; on the map. Coords (65.8, 84.7) Perhaps the spawn rate has been increased.</div>
