In fact if you are not seeing any then just go around killing the critters in the area and they will show up.  Third, you cannot kill the dragons nor make them go away without engaging them in a pet battle, so if you are waiting for a particular color then just keep going into battle with them and then run away and the color you want will spawn soon enough.

The ability he gets instead is only useful to an elemental-type, since when he uses Scorched Earth, he damages himself. (Ugly, too.)\r\n\r\n2. Get a Chicken-type which uses [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=581]Flock[\/url]. (Use a pokemon with [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=163]Stampede[\/url] instead if you prefer.)\r\n\r\n3. Put your Dragon out right before your Chicken.

Flock not only hits three times, but causes your opponent to take double damage as well.

Since I hardly saw anyone else camping them I came to the conclusion that they seem to just spawn in their own pace regardless of the other critters. I was unsure on the other wild pets in the area (mostly the frogs) so I kept killing off those that can be battled. Spawn rates seemed to go up steadily throughout the night and started declining after midnight, so it could possibly be related to zone population.\n\nMy advice would be to just check in every hour or so, there are usually around 3-4 up this way.

I find that using my Clockwork Gnome I can kill the hatchlings in 2-3 hits (Blitz) forfeit the match then move on to the next target; because it's 'Mechanical' if it dies it gets health back and is unlikely to die again before killing the hatchling, it is also unlikely to need to be revived via ability or bandages due to this so you can keep forfeiting indefinitely, and when you encounter the rare you need you can just forfeit the match, heal your pets with your ability that needn't be on a cooldown, and restart the battle.\n\n\nGood luck!\n\nAs an aside, if you find rares up that you don't need, please leave them alive for other collectors, thanks.","date":"2015-09-16T16:18:50-05:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2015-09-16T16:19:43-05:00",1,"783458"]}];

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kyokushinkai</b></h3>I had been looking for these pets for several days and managed to only find 1 or 2 spawns at a time; sometimes none at all. One day it was raining and these guys were literally everywhere. They were even respawning every few minutes as I made my rounds. If you want to collect these awesome little pets, go when it rains!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>NeoAnimus</b></h3>Spent a little bit farming a rare for each color and here's the trick I found to get them. First, they are a pretty common spawn everywhere in the arboretum. Second, they share a spawn with the stupid little garden frogs there, so if they are not spawning kill the frogs. In fact if you are not seeing any then just go around killing the critters in the area and they will show up. Third, you cannot kill the dragons nor make them go away without engaging them in a pet battle, so if you are waiting for a particular color then just keep going into battle with them and then run away and the color you want will spawn soon enough. It took me an hour of doing this and I got a rare in all three colors.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aliandrin</b></h3>So here is what you do to win:<br /><br />1. <i><b>Get this pokemon.</b></i> You want him for the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/petability=204">Call Lightning</a>, so get the yellow or green one; the red one isn't the one you want. The ability he gets instead is only useful to an elemental-type, since when he uses Scorched Earth, he damages himself. (Ugly, too.)<br /><br />2. Get a Chicken-type which uses <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=581">Flock</a>. (Use a pokemon with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=163">Stampede</a> instead if you prefer.)<br /><br />3. Put your Dragon out right before your Chicken. He's strong on his own, so he should be able to take down at least one elite by himself, with time left over to cast Call Lightning if it's not already up.<br /><br />4. Make sure Call Lightning is up when your Chicken comes out.<br /><br />5. Cast Flock.<br /><br />6. Win.<br /><br />Here's how this works: The lightning effect does extra damage on each hit. Flock not only hits three times, but causes your opponent to take double damage as well. This is an amasing way to actually win with a fairly weak pokemon (the Chicken, not the Dragon).<br /><br />It's a great combo which can be further enhanced by using a <a href="http://ptr.wowhead.com/item=92677">battlestoned</a>-up <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=65314">Jade Crane Chick</a> instead of a Chicken as of 5.1. This is because the Crane can put up a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=431">shield</a>, turning the hits from lightning into a pittance while still allowing you to use it to its greatest effect against your opponent (but you waste a turn casting the shield).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>300420</b></h3>Even if exalted and staying in the Arboretum they are NOT so much common.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1051651</b></h3>I went to the Arboretum when it was raining and found a many pet to catch. (Of course I'm exalted with the <a href="/faction=1271/order-of-the-cloud-serpent">Order of the Cloud Serpent</a>.) My first battle was against a rare <a href="/npc=65321/wild-crimson-hatchling">Wild Crimson Hatchling</a> (lucky me!) and it was really easy to catch: my pet was <a href="/npc=62555/flayer-youngling">Flayer Youngling</a> (lvl 25, rare), I used his Reflection to steal the hatchling's Lift-off ability. After this my pet didn't get damage because he became unattackable through the battle. I did the same against other pets and it always worked. Easy. :)<br /><br />So I'm sure that these hatchlings spawn in rain. I spent there maybe 20 mins and found rare quality from all three hatchlings. It wasn't too hard. :) If you want to rares, just begin the battle and forfeit if there is no rare pet.<br /><br />Have a good hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nasroth</b></h3>Caught a rare level 23 today, his stats were:<br /><br />HP - 1080<br />Attack - 281<br />Speed - 251</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>545160</b></h3>Think they've nerfed the spawn rate. I battled them all looking for a rare. It's been well over 30 mins, I've run around killing all the critters but still not a single serpent has spawned. Sad =(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>verduran</b></h3>Now that I've finally done camping a rare of each color, there's something i can share.<br /><br />When I first started camping yesterday (Saturaday noon on a medium pop server) I was expecting them to be fairly abundant based on the comments here. Imagine my surprise when I did a few rounds and found none of them up, furthermore, there was no other campers around that I can see. <br /><br />So I started getting rid of the wild pets, I started killing off critters as well, but I have only managed to find 1 hatchling in the first hour. I found 2 more during the second hour. After that I got tired and stopped killing critters all along. They seem to spawn quite steadily every 30min or so.<br /><br />I took a break and came back at around 5:30pm, there were around 4 or 5 of them up. Since I hardly saw anyone else camping them I came to the conclusion that they seem to just spawn in their own pace regardless of the other critters. I was unsure on the other wild pets in the area (mostly the frogs) so I kept killing off those that can be battled. Spawn rates seemed to go up steadily throughout the night and started declining after midnight, so it could possibly be related to zone population.<br /><br />My advice would be to just check in every hour or so, there are usually around 3-4 up this way. But if competition is fierce the place is great for herbing, and the frogs spawn really quickly so it maybe a good place to level up your lower lvl pets while camping.<br /><br />Good luck to fellow campers. My first crimson and second jade are rares, but my rare golden hatchling didn't come until 8am this morning (around 18 hours later)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1067567</b></h3>Honestly, I wouldn't waste your time farming a rare golden one. They are pretty awful for combat. You're better off farming for the emerald protodrake whelp.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>545160</b></h3>I think they stop spawning at certain times of the night. Otherwise they usually respawn at around a 15-30 minute rate. During the day I have no problems looking for them. But once it hits 9pm it seems they all stop spawning. Not completely sure about this though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>853396</b></h3>A point of clarification: You can only battle this wild pet on the character you have that is exalted with the faction. Even though pets and the achievement points for factions are account wide, the ability to battle them does not transfer to characters that are not exalted with the faction.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>507760</b></h3>Groups of 3-5 Hatchling spawned every 20-30 minutes for me, I've accidentally killed two rares and tried Alt F4ing to come back to a despawned pet. <br /><br />So them being friendly may tamper with that trick.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Znaleziatko</b></h3>After five days of daily visits to the Arboretum I finally have my three rares - the Wild Crimson Hatchling was the last one to catch. From what I've observed the Jade Hatchlings are most common (I've seen couple of rares), then there are the Golden Hatchlings (two rares) and I came across only one rare Crimson Hatchling.<br /><br />I have a tip for all of you rare-hunters - don't even bother trying to catch anything from the Jade Forest before spending your time on those three hatchlings. They have many different secondaries. In the proccess of catching rare hatchlings I also got my <b>rare</b> version of: <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=65215">Garden Moth</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63004">Grove Viper</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63919">Leopard Tree Frog</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63715">Jumping Spider</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62997">Jungle Darter</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62994">Emerald Turtle</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63006">Sandy Petrel</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62998">Mirror Strider</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63005">Spirebound Crab</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62999">Temple Snake</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=65216">Shrine Fly</a>.<br /><br />Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lithae</b></h3>Been here since 11:30pm or so, it is now 12:40am, and have not seen a single spawn. It may be connected to population or time like others have mentioned, because every 10-30 min spawns are not happening at all. 0 have appeared.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>690507</b></h3>I'd like to advise as well, if you're camping for a rare Golden, to bring a pet that can change the mechanical lightning storm to another weather effect. The storm can absolutely destroy your team, and I'd forgotten about this effect...nearly lost a rare I'd been camping for days due to not having the right team out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kalnazzar</b></h3>why is there no Wild Azure Hatchling?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Eido</b></h3><b>To sum up a couple observations from others posts as well as my own, relating to the three hatchlings:</b><br /><br /><u>CONFIRMED INFORMATION:</u><br /><ul><li>Found <b>in and around</b> the Arboretum, near the east coast of <a href="/zone=5785/the-jade-forest">The Jade Forest</a>.</li><li>For these battle pets to appear, your <b>specific </b>character must be <b>Exalted </b>with <a href="/faction=1271/order-of-the-cloud-serpent">Order of the Cloud Serpent</a>.</li><li>These hatchlings are <b>Friendly</b>, meaning you can only kill them via <i>pet battle</i>.</li><li>During battle, the <a href="/npc=65321/wild-crimson-hatchling">Wild Crimson Hatchling</a> may cast <a href="/pet-ability=172/scorched-earth">Scorched Earth</a> which can damage <b>itself</b>.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jazzycakes2</b></h3>Golden was the last one needed in my collection, passed by one day and saw a single golden and thought &quot;I NEED IT&quot;, turned out to be rare and I was ecstatic. And then I was brought out of pet battle by a lv86 alliance druid spamfiring me, I was about to cry if it AOE'd the pet as well, thankfully I killed him before the pet reappeared and got me some rare dragon<br /><br />tl;dr I have a dragon</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kynthea</b></h3>This also has the same model as Arenji. <a href="/npc=64158/arenji">Arenji</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>783458</b></h3>A couple of notes on a strategy for capturing rare versions of these 3 hatchlings:<br /><br />You should kill all other battle pets that you find near by to increase chance at spawning the hatchlings that you need. Now, to get the hatchlings to respawn you do not need to complete the full fight, you just need to kill the first battle pet. I find that using my Clockwork Gnome I can kill the hatchlings in 2-3 hits (Blitz) forfeit the match then move on to the next target; because it's 'Mechanical' if it dies it gets health back and is unlikely to die again before killing the hatchling, it is also unlikely to need to be revived via ability or bandages due to this so you can keep forfeiting indefinitely, and when you encounter the rare you need you can just forfeit the match, heal your pets with your ability that needn't be on a cooldown, and restart the battle.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />As an aside, if you find rares up that you don't need, please leave them alive for other collectors, thanks.</div>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
