I wanted this guy REAL bad).\r\n\r\nToday (Sunday) at 7:00am EST (same as Server time), it rained.

If I have learned anything it is that for being on of the most lush, green, and beautiful places in Warcraft, it does not rain much Stranglethorn Vale. One the very first day, I had IMMENSE luck finding all of my pets. I had found a Harpy Youngling immediatly, it was the only one. I had then found an uncommon Giraffe Calf within an hour. From there I went to find the Tiny Twister. I had spent about an hour waiting for one, before I gave up. I went over to the Dalaran Crater, searched for a Loft Libram, didn't find one, and went AFK. When I came back, 5 Loft Libram had spawned beside me, my fourth one being a rare. I had then went back to seek a Tiny Twister, and found a single one was spawned for my taking. I had than decided to try for this pet. \r\n\r\nI had spent the rest of that day, and the next three days... waiting for it to rain. I had left my computer on, and the speakers loud. So I would be able to hear it rain while in the kitchen, or on the ps3. It just would not rain, I only logged off to go to college, and sleep. I even logged in to check this if I woke up to use the restroom. I had tryed what others had suggested. I first killed all of the gorillas for about 30 minutes, than waited; nothing. Than I had tryed killing everything that dared to move, waited; nothing. I had even tryed mining everything, wound up with 28 stacks of Iron ore, 1 and a half stacks of gold, and almost 3 stacks of silver ore, but no monkey. So as far as triggers go, I had been trying all of them for several days, and others had too, but none worked. I had switched screens to do some research for college, and remembered to look at WoW, and I noticed it looked smoky. It had just started to rain when I looked! I had the entire Island to myself, and battled every pet in search of a rare, as fast as I could. I had fought:\r\n\r\n6 poor spawns\r\n8 common spawns\r\n7 uncommon spawns\r\n\r\nDuring the first 5 minutes about 5 of these monkeys had spawned later than the rest, ussually close to the beach. Unfortunatly, no rares were spawned. After I had finished the last battle, like wildfire half a dozen other people showed up, looking for a pet monkey. Needless to say, I am more or less hated on my server, but I was the one who had taken the time to wait my monkey pet out, not them. :)\r\n\r\nMy final comments are.\r\n1. It rains on Jaguero when it wants to rain on jaguero, I am positive that there are no triggers. \r\n2. I noticed when I had battled a uncommon pet, it was always joined by another uncommon pet. I don't know if it is coincidence, or if it is to slow someone down after you capture your rare monkey to give others a chance.\r\n3. I really don't like gorilla's, and after this, I will never think the same of them.","date":"2013-01-30T00:00:47-06:00","rating":-3,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":72,"id":1806823,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"darktemplaru","body":"I managed to catch a rare one myself after a few that were not rare (was the 6th or 7th). the hardest part was waiting for the rain. \nIt started raining at 23.00 (GMT+1) server time (Silvermoon - EU) and it stopped at 23.12. \nCleaned the whole initial spawn in a few mins(there were around 10-12 Baby apes spread around the island).

If it's snowing in Thunderfall it doesn't mean that it's snowing in any of the Arctic Fox Kit spawn points.\r\nJaguero Island is one of these differently coded weather locations. Like everyone else has said, the island itself needs rain for the NPC to spawn.\r\nThe coding is unhelpful, too. It's not got a certain time rotation between raining and not raining. This goes for the other locations. It will simply rain when it wants to rain, so it's totally at random, and I'm relatively sure that server maintenance and restart doesn't affect it.

By camping, I mean one toon is parked there on the island, and I check in as often as I think of it, which has been many times.  Then I made a breakthrough.  \n\nThere is this lightweight add on called \"Cross Realm Assist\", [edit: now called Realm Hop Assist], which you can get (free of course) on Curse.com and probably other places too.  It allows you to realm-hop, by joining pre-made custom groups with auto-accept.  You can kind of screen the groups too, so that you're not joining a group that doesn't want realm hoppers.   I prefer to use the ones that are offering garrison services (like \"come use my engineer's hut and the dust trader at my garry\") and avoid the RP groups and other groups that are likely to summon me.  Even though they often say \"Custom PvE\", be aware that some of the realms will be PvP realms.  I would not however let that deter you, because Jaguero Isle is not a big PvP place. :)  Chances are that anyone else you find there is either questing or looking for a pet, like you.  Stay on your mount, in the air if you can fly, until it's raining and you spy your Baby Ape to battle.  The area where you will be battling has King Mukla, a bunch of adult Bonobos and some \"stealth\" panthers, who are level 33 or so.  If your toon's level is significantly higher than them, it will make for a much easier time avoiding these mobs or killing them if need be.   \n\nAfter getting the add on, I logged on my toon on the island, and started realm hopping.  The first time I did it, I tried all the realms I could find (maybe 12 or so) and it wasn't raining anywhere.  I spent maybe 15 minutes doing this.  The second time I tried it, the fourth realm I tried, it started raining just as I arrived there.  I was able to get my Baby Ape (a blue B\/B first try, then the rest all seemed to be gray or white, but I wanted a P\/B so I took a white one).  I was probably lucky, because it rained for quite awhile after I got there, which is why I concluded that it only started around the time I arrived.  People have all been saying that, when it rains, it only rains for about 15 minutes.  \n\nAfter I did maybe 2 pet battles, I had a hard time finding any more baby apes to battle, even though there was only one other person there who was also looking to get a Baby Ape.  She and I flew around looking and looking it seemed for about 5 minutes, maybe longer, and there were NO green paws on the map.  All of a sudden it seemed a bunch more spawned, and I had a number to choose from.  I only tell you this so you won't get discouraged and leave.  \n\nAnyway, I highly recommend this method for getting your Baby Ape, and the add on has many other applications.  It is MUCH better than sitting in front of your computer for hours, waiting for it to rain!","date":"2015-07-19T16:30:07-05:00","rating":5,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Thank you so much, I've been trying to get this for so long and didn't think of it until lI read this!","creationdate":"2015-07-21T10:15:49-05:00","id":886243,"rating":0,"commentid":2217093,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"bryangraham85","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"Spent 3 hours waiting for this baby ape as I had no idea for how long it'd take, and yes I know that is nothing apparently.

I spent maybe two minutes on each character.\n\n4) At around 7:30am server time, one of my alts saw rain.  My third Baby Ape encounter was a rare.

<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wamo</b></h3>These guys can be found on Jaguero Island in The Cape of Stranglethorn. They currently use the same model as <a href="/spell=40549/bananas">Bananas</a>.<br /><br />They're one of the weather-dependent wild pet spawns! They spawn when it <b>rains</b>, and are up for about 15-20 minutes before despawning.<br /><br />As said below, Jaguero Island is oddly separate to the rest of the Cape weather-wise. So if it's raining in the Cape, it may not be raining on the island, and visa versa.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>Unlike many pets, these don't do much wandering. When they are spawned, they tend to keep to one spot and not move from it. When clicked on, they have a monkey-screech sound effect.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>neuroxin</b></h3>Can anyone confirm whether or not these are still in the game? I've been camping this island for hours waiting for it to rain and it hasn't rained yet. Is there some trick or schedule to when it rains? This is getting really frustrating. :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kokiron</b></h3>It FINALLY started raining and I managed to get an uncommon quality one of these. Most of the ones that sprang up were poor quality accompanied by a rare quality crimson moth. I only got to fight a few of them because as soon as it started raining the place was swarmed with people.<br /><br />Edit: Right after posting this, they started respawning and I managed to get a rare one. Looks like as long as it keeps raining they'll continue to spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>The weather on Jaguaro, where these spawn, is different than The Cape Of Stranglethorn at the moment. I attempted to head to the island when I landed to find it raining, only to find a bright and sunny day while I was there. You'll want to be prepared for this, and check now and again whether it's raining on Stranglethorn or not.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>446320</b></h3><b>Couple of tips:</b><br /><br />Northern STV, Southern STV and Jaguero Isle have separate weather. If its raining in one, it will most likely not be raining on the others.<br /><br />The rain lasts for about 10-20 minutes. The length seems to be random. The Baby Apes will respawn throughout the rain.<br /><br />Park an alt on the Isle or be prepared to camp. I have seen the rain multiple times and have yet to see a pattern. <br /><br />Good Luck!</div>

I had already been sitting at the island for 5 hours solid - without leaving - and there had been no rain up to that point.<br /><br />I don't know if it's the day + time combo, but I had definitely been at the Isle during the week, at 7:00am, and there had been no rain.<br /><br />Per the wowhead map, they were all isolated to the north, east, and south sides of the island.<br /><br />I would guesstimate that approximately 20-30 of the baby ape's spawned as soon as the rain started.<br /><br />Rain stopped at 7:17am.<br /><br />Contrary to what other people have noticed, they ALL insta-despawned as soon as it stopped raining.<br /><br />I had killed many of them, trying to find a Rare, so *if* any had respawned, they certainly didn't stay up after the rain had ended. There wasn't a single other person nearby (I had the island to myself), so any potential respawns wouldn't have been killed either.<br /><br />My only piece of advice, because I wish it's something I had done from the beginning - bind yourself in Booty Bay, farm other mini's for 10 mins, and then hearth back to check for spawns ... and logout on the Isle so that you can quickly check in your spare moments.<br />Hope this helps!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hashupa</b></h3>I want to clarify what I mean by this comment, so I'm rewriting it.<br /><br />There is a possibility that the apes will not respawn before the rain is done.<br />Back in 5.0.5 when I posted this comment, I went around the entire island during a rainstorm and the apes only spawned ONCE and no respawns were available.<br /><br />It's more likely they will respawn, but you're better off capturing even a poor instead of waiting for a rare to spawn!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>VicarChromaggus</b></h3><b>About the weather effects:</b><br /><br /><div class="quote-box">&quot;Instead, each sub-zone among the 11 where weather is currently available is now linked to a set of variables that allow for the possibility of precipitation. The variables have been set to make the potential weather appropriate, meaning heavy showers are more likely in one region and drizzles in another. As Kaplan described it, the zone is practically asking itself whether there will be weather. &quot;It's sort of randomly picking: 'I'm ready to rain but do I want to rain?' &quot; he said. Duration will be chosen based on an automated system as well, with enough variables to make things unpredictable. &quot;We didn't want it to be such a mathematical formula that somebody could literally sit with a stopwatch, log in, go to a zone and go, 'OK in two, one, go â€” it's going to rain.' &quot;</div><br /><br /><u>Source:</u> <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Weather_effects" rel="nofollow">Weather Effects</a><br /><br /><b>My personal note:</b><br />This SHOULD mean that certain variables TRIGGER the rain.<br />The question remains: &quot;Which variables?&quot;.<br /><br />Considered Jaguero Island has it's on variables related to the change in weather, it will be more likely that you trigger the rain by doing whatever you can on the island, like killing, gathering, fishing. But this is just a theory.<br /><br />Please post whatever you did last on the island whenever it started to rain.<br />This includes: 'Logging in', 'Flying over', 'Killing', 'Proffesion use', 'Emoting' or just random sitting.<br /><br />The possibility that pet battles trigger the weather effect will be unlikely, since the weather effects have been implanted in patch 1.10, but could work.<br />Even re-entering the island by continiously switching between entering STV and Jaguero Island might work (Something like: variable = 50th person to enter island = rain).<br /><br /><b>Testing:</b><br />While killing <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=43417">Skymane Bonobo's</a> to trigger weather effects, this dropped on the 21th kill <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=8494">Parrot Cage (Hyacinth Macaw)</a> :)<br /><br /><b>What I did to get my apes after reconsidering killing the BonoboÂ´s:</b><br />Killed all the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=2521">Skymane Gorilla's</a> , so there were only the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=43417">Skymane Bonobo's</a>, Kept killing newly spawning Gorilla's.<br />Sat down, 5 minutes later: Rain, o glorious rain.

Also of note, I went back to farm a <a href="/npc=61323/wharf-rat">Wharf Rat</a> about 5 minutes later, and physically saw a Baby Ape respawn in front of me.

This was the first time I had seen it raining but the first few mins there were no Baby Apes to be seen. 5.28 they started spawning and I caught myself an uncommon :)<br />The rain lasted about 12 mins from when I had logged in and the remaining spawns disappeared once the rain ended. Happy ape hunting :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>augernaut1</b></h3>I must be luckier than most. First day (two days ago) I when to the island and after about 30 minutes of pet battling it began to rain. First baby ape I battled was a Rare, then the third was another rare. the rest until everyone else showed up was a uncommon and a few commons. Just came out to post this note that I logged in and after 10 minutes it started raining and I pick up a third rare on the first battle. If you see me around I would be willing to trade a rare for something I don't have. Good luck to y'all that are still trying.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1045514</b></h3>had an alt parked on the island to spot the rain. After 6-7 hours of just sitting there while doing other things it finally started to rain. Ran over there with my main and got a rare ape on the first catch! Felt really lucky :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1044793</b></h3>Can honestly say that 7 is my lucky number. Once again, I camped this for 7 hours and it FINALLY started raining. I did everything I could during that whole duration. Herbed, fished, killed, just sat there, etc....and at 9:54 p.m. server, it started raining.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cicchetto</b></h3>I caught mine just this morning. I was going around gathering ore, skins, fish, etc. I doubted it would rain, but I checked the island anyways. I arrived there at 5:15am server time and said &quot;please rain :(&quot;, I hopped onto wowhead and started reading about everyone's input. Then I maximized WoW and... it was raining (5:20am server time). I managed to go through enough of them to get an uncommon. Luckily none of the higher levels had seen me. They were all battling for the baby instead of being sneaky about it. <br /><br />Another note: I would assume that they do respawn. After I caught the first 3, I looked around for more and none were on the minimap. I had circled the mountains in the middle twice and none appeared. The third time around there were about 7 more.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>N1ppe</b></h3>You have to be inside Jaguero Isle zone to see the rain. If you stand outside the zone you won't see rain on the island.<br /><br />Did this mistake with my lv 1 orc camping there, was scared of some invisible panthers killing me :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lorax42</b></h3>This is my experience with the rain on the island:<br /><br />After being on the island for almost 3 hours, the rain started at 3:40pm server time. There were 3-4 other people on the island that were obviously there to find a Baby Ape. I managed to initiate 10 battles before the islands had been cleared out by farmers.<br /><br />At 3:53 server time, I found my first respawn. By this time, there were less people farming, so I was able to consistently start up battle one after the other for a bit of time.<br /><br />At 4:01 pm server time, I found my rare quality baby ape.<br /><br />I stopped battling after I got my rare, but saw about 3 more before the rain stopped at 4:08 server time.<br /><br /><b><u>Final totals:</u></b> <br /><ul><li>28 battles initiated </li><li>8 poor </li><li>13 common</li><li>6 uncommon</li><li>1 rare</li><li>28 minutes of rain time</li></ul><br /><br />Good Luck, Everybody!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1048249</b></h3>I just caught this one after camping most of the day and must point out a few things I noticed.<br /><br />What I did was move my main and moved an alt (85) on another server in a different time zone to their spawn and would switch back and forth every now and then. I did try the method for a while to kill certain mobs/all mobs/profession stuff but I really feel this is a placebo and won't actually do anything to help out. I ended up just parking myself in the air and waiting.<br /><br />There was no rain on my main server so I hopped over to my alt server and it was raining when I logged in around 4:08. I don't really care about rares so I caught one easily and sat around to see who else was catching stuff. The place was deserted so I decided to get a rare after all because they'd just disappear shortly anyway and after going through about 3 fights, found a rare.<br /><br />I really wanted to post this though because I'm pretty sure that they were respawning during the rain. Maybe it was a zoning thing (sigh) because I did see another player come over when I was about leave after getting a rare and he was from a different zone so I have no idea if it was my server or our servers blending or whatever nonsense that zone thing is causing. It could also be because of the time I was doing it during the rain, having no idea how long it had been raining before I logged on. But there were plenty of apes. Good luck to those still trying to get one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>789238</b></h3>I've been waiting for the rain on Jaguero Isle for over 6 hours, and discovered, when I was just about to run back to town to quickly heal up my pets and then come back again... the rain cycle of the Isle is different then the rest area. If you are off the Isle, even a few yards, you won't see the rain on the isle, and if you're on the isle, you won't see if it's clear or raining off it. Right now, as I wait, I move 2 yards off the island on my Shammy and I'm in a rain storm, while the island itself is bone dry. <br /><br />Kicking myself for standing out on the water fishing, because I don't know if I missed the spawn or not.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Galaxas</b></h3>I think I just experienced an anomaly, but it's currently raining on both the island and the cape right now. Started at exactly 5:30am EST on Jaguero, and as I was flying to do my pet daily I saw the cape raging as well. <br /><br />About 30 apes spawned, so I blew through them all in about 3 minutes looking for my rare, and within 2 minutes more started popping up. Didn't get the rare and decided to leave when people started showing up looking confused as to why they were all gone. xD Good thing they respawn!<br /><br />Edit: Seems Jaguero Isle is not as in need of rain as the rest of stranglethorn; the rain stopped by 5:42am and it's still raining on the cape. That's a very short window to get this cute little pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rothar</b></h3>I've had an alt parked on Jaguero Isle for over a week now with no luck, have never seen it rain until today.<br /><br />Oddly enough, I was doing Golden Lotus dailies out in Valley of Eternal Blossums, when it started raining. Just before turning the quests in the rain stopped and it cleared up. I thought, &quot;why not?&quot;, so I logged onto my alt.<br /><br />Sure enough, it was raining in Jaguero Isle! Mounted and ran about, engaged and captured the first Baby Ape I encountered!<br /><br />I don't know if the two are linked, or if this was just a fluke, but it's worth looking out for.<br /><br />(As has already been said, Jaguero Isle has its own weather pattern, separate from the rest of Cape of Stranglethorn.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>378260</b></h3><u><b>Rare hunters, take note!</b></u><br /><br />Alt+f4ing, exiting the game, or otherwise disconnecting will reset any pet battle so long as one pet in the encounter is still alive. After you re-enter the game, the pet will have respawned in the same spot with the same battle configuration, including add-on pets and rarity (if any). <br /><br />Any pet abilities in the encounter may be re-rolled when using this method.<br /><br /><i>So if you accidentally kill a rare battle pet, you can reset the encounter so long as one other pet is still alive.</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Riven</b></h3>I logged in to a rainy Jaguero Island a few days ago a little before 5:15 am EST (2 am server time). I believe the rain started at precisely 5, and ceased about 2 minutes after I arrived. I had enough time to battle 2 apes, although I noticed there had to be at least 15 spawns up and I didn't see anyone else on the island. It also happened to be raining in the cape at the same time, which was likely just coincidental. It seems as though very early morning may be a good time to check the island for rain. I have yet to personally come across any comments from people catching baby apes between 6pm and midnight, so perhaps we're onto something here...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Esploratore</b></h3>Here's my experience (this was one of my 2 missing pets in the eastern kingdoms, so done quite some stuff in pet battles): was checking at jaguero isle on my mage, fastest char to get there, and no rain, went here to read the comments, checked again in game, thought to kill gorillas and without even noticing for the first few seconds, it was actually raining in the island. I started searching for apes, found a lot, got 3 poor quality ones at first, then as I noticed they all had the same hp and stats (383 hp, 90 and 72 of the 2 stats), I knew they all were poor, so I immediately forfeited the matches, but then I found one with 497 hp, didn't expect much more, but at least common or uncommon, instead captured and it was a rare; literally 5 sec after the rain ended, very strange as I'm usually unlucky. Killed a gorilla the second the rain ended though, so these gorillas may actually trigger start and end of the rain. The rain lasted very few minutes, but if it started to raining as soon as I alt tabbed it's possible they actually were more.<br /><br />My screenshots say:<br /><br />Started checking for rain at around 5.00-5.05, not perfectly sure about this.<br />Saw the rain at 5.19 the first time and started catching apes.<br />Got the rare at 5.26 and that is also the minute in which the rain stopped.<br /><br />So it may actually be that I came back just in time before the rain was ending.<br /><br />Overnight, ofc.</div>

I got probably 20 common/poors and caught 2 uncommon over the duration of the 2 weeks before I finally got my rare. The rare I got had 497 hp before capture.

Was hanging about today during a rainfall and had 2 waves within approx 15-20 minutes. <br /><br />Don't know if &quot;killing&quot; all the current baby apes is required for a new wave to spawn or that it's just time based.<br /><br />Edit: kept some of them alive and didn't get a respawn for at least 10-15 min. Then the rain stopped and they all despawned, so can't really proof if you need to kill the previous ones to get a new wave.<br />Good luck to the pet farmers out there !</div>

There's got to be some add-on that tells people when it's raining in what zone, or a way to predict it somehow, perhaps it being linked with rain in other, far-away zones.<br /><br />I just zoned in to Jaguero Isle and I'm certain that me zoning in was what caused the rain. Even if not...<br /><br />Not thirty seconds after it began raining, the zone was swamped with people (perhaps thirty) trying to capture the Baby Ape. I got one, luckily, but I was there when it started raining (no one else was), and I was incredibly lucky to get just the one.</div>

I figured (according to the helpful comments that I have already seen) that it would not be raining on the island. This was the case. However, I decided to kill any of the beasts on the island as I do not have a hyacinth macaw yet. <br /><br /> <b>After about 5 minutes of killing anything that moved on the island, It started to rain. If there are multiple triggers to create rain, perhaps killing anything on the island will increase those chances.</b> The first one I captured was of uncommon status. I did not capture anymore of them seeing as I have been saving a beast stone just for this little guy. I used my Hearthstone and announced in trade that it was raining on the island in hopes that some good karma will come my way as I struggle to obtain a scourged whelpling.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>986651</b></h3>I just want to point out there is no rhyme or reason to the weather. I sat for 10 and 1/2 hours before it rained. Luckily, the rain happened at 12:10am and lasted until 12:23am. Our storm didn't seem to last as long as others have posted, so don't assume that you can just log in and check every 10 mins, you may miss it. I captured a common one first, just in case I didn't come across any better quality. There were a few people here so I had to fight for these little guys. Finally got an uncommon quality, sadly no rares. Friend of mine got a rare. Out of the 10 I battled, 5 were poor quality, 4 were common and 1 was uncommon. Good luck to those wanting this guy!</div>

I spent a few hours last night killing everything I ran into and nothing happened. I switched to a different toon on a different server today to farm and happened to log into a storm at 11:15pm US Central. There were people everywhere, but I managed to get to battle quite a few of the little cuties, most being poor quality. However, I ran into an uncommon just as the rain ended. Now I just need my rare!</div>

Please. -.-<br /><br />I waited/been waiting for about three hours now. Just running around the island. I got bored and started killing stuff but mainly I was there to get a rare rat. I still haven't got it, damn it.<br /><br />Then this ally panda came running by. Low level. I figure he's trying to quest so I lay off killing stuff for a while. 1/2hr or so later he's still running around. I figure, gah, he's bound to have gotten all he needs by now he's just killing to kill. So I resume killing stuff.<br />Turns out he was probably skilling up his skinning because I'd clear the apes out and he'd run along behind me and skin them all. <br />Eventually, he bowed graciously and hearthed. I was sad. He was the only company and really only the thing to DO while I waited.<br /><br />Back to farming my rare rat I guess -sigh-. Hey WoW God? You can make it start raining any time now. Please. I want to go to bed and my shoulder is starting to hurt from the excessive time spent using my mouse. :(</div>

I wanna note that there isn't just one that spawns, or a couple but a bunch, all over the island too not just where King Mukla is. And several people caught one. Mine was of poor quality but Im okay with that, so I didn't try farming, not to mention the several other people there who were trying for one.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ladyofthemasque</b></h3>Rain started at about 8:33am on a Friday morning, server time (pacific coast time as well). Rain ended 20 minutes later at 8:53am. I saw 4 or so poor (grey) quality, one common (white), several uncommon (green), and no rare (blue) baby apes. Didn't try any of the strand crabs that were available, just went for the baby apes that had spawned in the rain. Secondary battle animals included long-tailed moles, strand crabs, parrots, a tree python, a lizard hatchling, and a crimson moth.<br /><br />(After capturing a good quality green within the first few fights, I hit Retreat and just cycled through each pet set to see what else was available, in the hopes a blue rare would show up. I did this AFTER making sure I was the only person on Jaguero Isle looking for baby apes; otherwise it would've been rude and rather selfish to fight/retreat in rapid succession. Most of us players are nice people who don't mind sharing, after all.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>m4zurka</b></h3>I was camping at Jaguero Isle for about 40 minutes before it started raining. It was around 9:45 (EST and realm time) on a Monday morning. I saw two Baby Apes right away and captured one, although it was Poor quality. An alliance character was with me on the isle as well and snagged the second one. We both circled around the isle for a few minutes in opposite directions, and I found another Poor. Another Horde character joined us, and I beat him to one last ape as the rain was stopping: my Rare! The rain lasted no more than 10 minutes, and I personally saw only 4 apes total during that time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wedgietime</b></h3>Over 4 days, I have caught many of the rare, hard to get battle pets. If I have learned anything it is that for being on of the most lush, green, and beautiful places in Warcraft, it does not rain much Stranglethorn Vale. One the very first day, I had IMMENSE luck finding all of my pets. I had found a Harpy Youngling immediatly, it was the only one. I had then found an uncommon Giraffe Calf within an hour. From there I went to find the Tiny Twister. I had spent about an hour waiting for one, before I gave up. I went over to the Dalaran Crater, searched for a Loft Libram, didn't find one, and went AFK. When I came back, 5 Loft Libram had spawned beside me, my fourth one being a rare. I had then went back to seek a Tiny Twister, and found a single one was spawned for my taking. I had than decided to try for this pet. <br /><br />I had spent the rest of that day, and the next three days... waiting for it to rain. I had left my computer on, and the speakers loud. So I would be able to hear it rain while in the kitchen, or on the ps3. It just would not rain, I only logged off to go to college, and sleep. I even logged in to check this if I woke up to use the restroom. I had tryed what others had suggested. I first killed all of the gorillas for about 30 minutes, than waited; nothing. Than I had tryed killing everything that dared to move, waited; nothing. I had even tryed mining everything, wound up with 28 stacks of Iron ore, 1 and a half stacks of gold, and almost 3 stacks of silver ore, but no monkey. So as far as triggers go, I had been trying all of them for several days, and others had too, but none worked. I had switched screens to do some research for college, and remembered to look at WoW, and I noticed it looked smoky. It had just started to rain when I looked! I had the entire Island to myself, and battled every pet in search of a rare, as fast as I could. I had fought:<br /><br />6 poor spawns<br />8 common spawns<br />7 uncommon spawns<br /><br />During the first 5 minutes about 5 of these monkeys had spawned later than the rest, ussually close to the beach. Unfortunatly, no rares were spawned. After I had finished the last battle, like wildfire half a dozen other people showed up, looking for a pet monkey. Needless to say, I am more or less hated on my server, but I was the one who had taken the time to wait my monkey pet out, not them. :)<br /><br />My final comments are.<br />1. It rains on Jaguero when it wants to rain on jaguero, I am positive that there are no triggers. <br />2. I noticed when I had battled a uncommon pet, it was always joined by another uncommon pet. I don't know if it is coincidence, or if it is to slow someone down after you capture your rare monkey to give others a chance.<br />3. I really don't like gorilla's, and after this, I will never think the same of them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>darktemplaru</b></h3>I managed to catch a rare one myself after a few that were not rare (was the 6th or 7th). the hardest part was waiting for the rain. <br />It started raining at 23.00 (GMT+1) server time (Silvermoon - EU) and it stopped at 23.12. <br />Cleaned the whole initial spawn in a few mins(there were around 10-12 Baby apes spread around the island). I was the only one chasing pets on the island at that point. I didn't engage any other pet but the Baby ape.<br />1st respawn after i cleared the zone was at 23.12. There was another one at 23.13 and one at 23.14 and the very second the rain stopped. <br />Also remember to activate track pets on minimap if u are camping on an alt and forgot about it. I was running around and seeing the rain and wondering where the pets are.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1012488</b></h3>A brief word about the rain on Jaguero Isle: I've seen the rain effects in many zones all over Azeroth (Thunder Bluff is very nice in the rain) but what my priest alt experienced on the Isle was a bloody tropical downpour! My weather effects are turned to only halfway to reduce lag but even so my visibility was so reduced I had to slow down and sweep the mouse back and forth over the screen to avoid stepping on the stealthing kitties out there. A very impressive storm that night indeed! Anyone else see a storm like that too?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>RS817</b></h3>I decided to check the comments for any helpful tips and it started raining on the island (12:45 PM EST) It rained for about 15 minutes. I grabbed a poor quality and was able to grab an uncommon. I checked the few others that were left between myself and another player until they were all gone. I watched for a few minutes to see how long the rain was going to last and decided to start flying away. I got to the shore of the island and stopped for a second and the rain stopped for about 10 seconds and then started again. I flew back into the island and it was raining there and new apes had spawned. I grabbed a rare on the second one I tried. The second rain only lasted about 2-3 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1051133</b></h3>So just wanted to post my lucky story.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1090184</b></h3>First Off I would like to say congrats to anyone who has been able to get this battle pet...I kept one of my toons on the isle for about a week and sitting there for hours on end with no rain. Finally on the 7th day of sitting there (which I was about to give up) I left the island to help a friend and when I came back it was finally raining... This happened today at 2am EST and lastest for 15 minutes. I only noticed spawns for the baby ape happening on the monkey side of the island but there were quite a few other people there. I managed to get an uncommon baby ape and that is good enough for me. <br /><br />P.S. I did try all the triggers mentioned before by others and none seemed to have worked. Hope this helps and happy hunting :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JumperBaltzer</b></h3>These guys do only spawn in the rain, As far as I can tell, It rains on the island about 4-6 times a day, and the Baby Ape will despawn the second the rain stops (Unless you have one in Combat, it will complete the battle) keep in mind that Both Horde AND Alliance are trying to obtain this in the same area so use a PVE server if you do not want to fight for a shot at this pet.</div>

I did get my rare, it took about 9 different tries before I got him, I was the only one on the island as well.<br />Afterwards there were still 8+ there (and still spawning).<br />I told everyone in /1 to come get their ape!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>KingSeamus</b></h3>In addition to camping an alt there, if you have a friend on another server or a 2nd account with toons on other servers after checking with your alt, have the friend invite them to a group. The Friend or 2nd alt will need to be higher level, this can force CRZ to kick in and spawn you in a new realm. This will give a second &quot;check&quot; each time you log in to see if its raining. <br />This can also work with two toons that are the same level, but it may not always pull you off of your current realm. <br />GL All :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1106081</b></h3>i read a few posts complaining about ppl killing all of the pets off, i see why they do this because if you've waited so long of course you want a rare one, however this is avoidable i do it all the time, if you enter a pet battle and immediately forfeit, it takes 10% of all your pets health but the wild pet immediately respawns this works well because if you do find a rare one and your pets have low health when you finally happen to find it you can forfeit heal and rebattle that pet to cage i have currently done it with almost every pet i have caught because i dont see the point in caging a &quot;poor&quot;pet happy hunting! go to wowhead.com/map it shows all spawns in all areas very convenient when traveling a whole continent::)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1106081</b></h3>Another tip****** when battling pet battle masters i always go in and immediately forfeit the match so that i can see which order the battle master is sending their pets in, so lets say the battle master has a critter, a mechanical and a dragon in that order, you could see it then set your pets in the order of beast(to go against critter), elemental (to go against machine) and humanoid ( to go against dragonkin) when you have your stats set up right you can kick some major butt, so after your pets are in the desired order of battle simply heal and rebattle the master:)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sanguinezor</b></h3>I just spent a solid 12 hours(never away from the pc for more than 2 mins) camping this pet. <br /><br />What i have learned. <br /><br />- The theory about killing apes and killing certain apes and leaving them alive does not trigger the rain.<br />- There is NO TRIGGER for the rain.<br />- For obvious reasons. There does not NEED to be rain within a certain time period<br />- As stated previously. STV rain is seperate from the Isle rain<br /><br />I had intervals of annoyance and went on a killing spree and killed everything i saw in hopes of a Hyacinth Macaw drop. <br /><br />Following my camp.<br /><br />I recommend that you farm this casually. Leave a lowbie alt on the Island and log it once in awhile.<br />If you have the option of asking Real-id's on diff servers to check their CRZ, do it. It adds to the &quot;chance&quot; of hitting a lucky crz where it is raining.<br /><br />Happy Hunting.<br />Soooo Close to Zookeeper<br />Sanguinezor</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1109415</b></h3>I got mine last night, managed to find a rare :)<br /><br />I saw these on a pet listing and thought they were cute, went to go try to find one. At first I had no idea that it had to be raining. After getting to the island and not seeing any I alt-tabbed over to read about them more, and when I saw that it had to be raining I thought &quot;lol ain't nobody got time for that&quot; and knew I would never try to camp for rain or try to find one of these guys. When I tabbed back over to leave, it was raining! Seemed to me that it rainied for only about 10 minutes, it was 1:30 am PST. <br /><br />Third one that I engaged was a rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>NewsAlchemist</b></h3>Here's something to consider.<br />A friend of mine told me that he had been hunting these, same as me. He did them in the middle of the night and wee hours of the morning. 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. (ish).<br />He mentioned that he had been farming in Tanaris (Sithilid Hatchling), it stormed there, he moved to Storm Peaks (Arctic Fox) and got a three-time-charm by hitting Baby Ape in Jaguero next.<br /><br />I started on the same idea approximately 12 hours later - nabbed my Hatchling in Tanaris around 3-3:10 p.m., went to Jaguero for awhile, no rain -- so I moved to Storm Peaks around 3:30 p.m. - it was snowing. Now onto Jaguero Isle around 3:45 p.m. - 4 p.m.<br /><br />Perhaps they're timed to rotate, giving just enough time to travel from one to the other (about 20-25 minutes spawn time, before the weather &quot;moves&quot;) Its silly, but its worked out twice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>maryalice</b></h3>Captured my rare, Baby Ape, today (Friday) at 7:45 am PST - that's real and server time. <br /><br />Like others have said, it needs to be &quot;raining&quot; and nothing you do before then will make them spawn (i.e. killing stuff, taming all the crabs, etc.). I was training my level 1 critters to 10 using the crabs on he island and as soon as it started raining - BAMM! - the island was filled with Baby Ape in all the spots show on the map above. <br /><br />Happy hunting &amp; good luck :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Draewind</b></h3>Flew out to the Island and it was a beautiful sunny day. As I flew in under the trees it was raining hard and Baby Apes were everywhere on the east side of the island ... from waterline in the south to waterline in the north. The moral is ... get under the trees when you are checking the weather. It doesn't look like rain from the air around the island.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1116705</b></h3>Be aware, some say that the rain lasts at least 15-20 minutes, but I think this is completely random too. When I got on the island it started raining after a minute or two (I know I'm lucky) and it stopped roughly 30 seconds after. Luckily I was able to catch a Baby Ape before that, but don't idle around when it rains as it can stop very suddenly. Realm was Twisting Nether.<br />Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>aderana</b></h3>For anyone who is wondering, as I was, you can HEAR the rainstorm on Jaguero Isle. I had an alt camped there, and heard it raining even before I was fully logged in. Engaged the first one I saw and could tell the rain stopped from the sound as I was battling.<br /><br />This means you can camp this guy while you are tabbed out. Just make sure you have &quot;Sound in Background&quot; checked (Game Menu, System, Sound, then check the box, about 2/3 of the way down the list) and you will still hear your WoW sounds when tabbed out. I had my ambience (slider bar to the right) turned all the way up. You should be hearing birds chirping when it isn't raining. When you hear the rain start, tab in and capture away.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />Edit: Just verified that this still works. Unfortunately, if someone sets off a <a href="/item=104303/rain-stone">Rain Stone</a>, it SOUNDS like rain but doesn't spawn these apes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Panos999</b></h3>It finally started raining, @00:20 (after 5 hours straight of waiting) and the rain stayed for a good 45 min which gave a nice 3-4 waves of them, no rares though (6 peeps were farming it at the same time as me)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rj23</b></h3>If you are pet collector you will appreciate this, but probably hate me for it. In my quest to capture rare pets a friend of mine began casing Jaguero Isle waiting for rain. We were in separate realms. She left a toon here and I left a toon here. Periodically we would check in and over the course of a couple of weeks she caught hers and I was offline :( We both kept a toon in hopes of rain. Finally the rain came! Not only did I catch my Baby Ape, but I caught a rare before the rain stopped.<br /><br />Earlier she and I discussed some strategies for catching the Minifernal. I said, let me just go see if there is one there now. So I flew to Felwood. There were two in the area! I caught one that was uncommon. The other was poor, but it was still a Minifernal! So I cross realmed party with her and she caught it. To be clear there were none in her realm and she crossed to mine to catch it.<br /><br />With this streak going I decided to look and see if there was a sand storm brewing in Tanaris. There wasn't in my realm, but in my friends realm there was. So we partied again and I crossed into her realm. I was able to catch a rare Silithid Hatchling. From beginning to end it took less than an hour. I am a very unlucky person, but i have to say this was some serious luck! I still cannot believe this happened!<br /><br />If someone can teach me how to link in WoWhead I will go back and amend this story with links to each pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>480715</b></h3>All weather-dependant spawns are in sort of phased zones, as far as weather goes. The specific spawn points of the creatures have different weather coding, and the weather needs to be ideal in those specific points for them to spawn. A good example of this is Storm Peaks. If it's snowing in Thunderfall it doesn't mean that it's snowing in any of the Arctic Fox Kit spawn points.<br />Jaguero Island is one of these differently coded weather locations. Like everyone else has said, the island itself needs rain for the NPC to spawn.<br />The coding is unhelpful, too. It's not got a certain time rotation between raining and not raining. This goes for the other locations. It will simply rain when it wants to rain, so it's totally at random, and I'm relatively sure that server maintenance and restart doesn't affect it. You just have to wait.<br /><br />I'd suggest waiting in the middle of the island. There are always battle pets around the coast, mostly strand crabs. If you wait in the middle, even if your graphics are set quite low so you can't quite see the rain, the pets will appear on your minimap with 'track battle pets' enabled, and you won't get them confused with strand crabs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Triffy</b></h3>After who knows how long camping on Jag Island, finally tonight it rained ! <br /><br />I can't add much to what has already been written here :<br /><br />The Baby Apes spawn in two levels, 9 and 10. The higher level ones are on the south-east side (near and around the big gorilla)<br /><br />They seem to spawn immediately as the rain starts in a finite number. There were 2 of us on the Island as the rain started, and we worked through the pets north to south, I was expecting a re-spawn, but in spite of the rain continuing for another 20 odd minutes, no new baby apes appeared.<br /><br />Good Luck, and happy hunting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Laichzeit</b></h3><b>SOME USEFUL INFO:</b><br /><br /> I parked two different toons (from two different realms) in jaguero isle.<br /> the first realm (toon #1) was <u>Uldaman</u>. It's a lvl 90. No rain. Logged out at 12:10am central time (server time on both was 1:10am EST) and I went to the next server (<u>icecrown</u>).<br /> alt toon parked in jaguero isle, I<i>T WAS RAINING</i>. Meaning you seem to be on your own little um, &quot;world&quot; separate from some CRZ servers...or they get lumped in some other form. (I've seen people from uldaman while in icecrown on other places, so I don't know if the island has less servers since it's smaller).<br /> to test this, I noted all the toons in the area (jaguero isle). I saw alliance and horde and when I went to the other toon, I noticed those same people weren't there. The people who were battling the apes in icecrown while I was in uldaman were not there. I did log back to the icecrown toon to see if they were still there, and yeah they were. The main toon being a hunter it was easy to track them down, but as the other was a non-hunter, I had to search for them if they were of the opposite faction.<br /> rain lasted about 20 mins. I noticed the apes where spawning at a slower rate after the first batch, so if you're one of the first people there....please just get one and leave. That's what battle stones are for =(<br /><br /><b>so the moral of the story is, the more alts you have scattered in different realms, the higher chances you'll get to get this elusive pet. When they spawn, it is a funny sight. Apes...apes everywhere!</b></div>

Choose your uncommon drop pets or pets that aren't available to catch later at a higher level of course.<br />After you catch your Baby Ape continue to level those pets waiting for the sandstorm in Tanaris.<br />Remember not to level over 14 or that time will be wasted when upgrading with battle stone.<br /><br />Note: you can level tamed pets from 9 to 10 for the leveling achievement. same with leveling to 25.<br /><br />It's true, the rain is random for when and how long it will rain. And the island has its on climate so rain on the cape does not mean rain on the island. I have not read anything about any fix for spawns with any patch.</div>

It was around 17:25 (Turalyon EU, Server Time, i was too excited to check the clock) when it started raining I wasn't doing anything (i was chatting with a friend of mine, but i was just standing still in game) and there wasn't anyone else on the island (i was there with my Hunter so i could track), once i got 2 Apes (1 Poor B/B and one Uncommon P/P) i wrote in /1 that it was raining on the island, but no one came. <br />I kept fighting pets to find a rare. I found B/B and P/P quite evenly so i don't think the P/P spec is rare. I managed to find only 1 rare (B/B) just before it stopped raining (at 17:38).<br />It is worth mentioning that i've been on the island since 10 am, sometimes just standing and sometimes killing anything on sight and pet battling, but it looks like it had no effect on the rain</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>widderwise</b></h3>Turalyon EU: Rain began @ 9:40am server time.<br /><br />I took advantage of the 10 day invitation and re-opened my 2nd account. I spent a very long evening playing with my old Druid with the sound turned off. I ran my primary account with the sound on and logged to a suitable character on Jaguero Isle, sitting away from the path of patrolling mobs. This way I was able to play on the Druid account whilst listening to the sounds from Jaguero Isle for when it rained - the rain, by the way, makes a loud hissing noise. You'll know when it rains!<br /><br />It took approximately 7 hours to rain, possibly more since I have no idea when it had last rained on the island.<br /><br />Although I was pleased to finally get the Baby Ape I was disgusted with the incredible time sink that this has been, as well as other pets that rely on specific weather patterns to spawn. So much so that I raised a ticket to the GMs about how harsh it was for something that is, when all said and done, a cosmetic feature - since the abilities aren't unique to this pet. Either Blizzard should make the weather more regular or remove the weather as an issue and just put in placeholders like some of the other rares, or make it a seasonal pet, such as the Snowy Owl (the last pet I need for Safari achievement) that spawns in Winter and will no doubt be quite common for the duration.<br /><br />I only hope others have better luck than I did considering how much time I've spent over the last 2 months logging in randomly and camping for hours at an end.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DawnSeven</b></h3>Just a thought for rare hunters. We all know we run around and kill anything less than a rare so that a new pet can spawn, but people get righteously pissed about killing apes. Maybe somebody is hunting a rare, maybe someone doesn't care about the quality and just wants the pet, maybe someone doesn't care because they're going to stone it anyway. It really doesn't matter (and who wants to have a conference about it?). So if you're rare hunting and find something other than your blue and forfeit, stick a raid marker on it and move on. That way someone else can grab it if they don't care and you won't lose track of where you were and waste time repeatedly engaging the same pet(s) as you run around.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Freewolf</b></h3><u>Helpful Tips to Increase Your Chances at Seeing it Rain and Caging the Baby Ape</u><br /><br /><b>Baby Ape's location:</b> Jaguero Island that is in the zone and off the coast of 'The Cape of Stranglethorn'.<br /><br /><b>When the Baby Ape spawns:</b> This is another &quot;weather pet.&quot; In this case, rain. Raining on the Island is completely random, so it can be a bit irritating standing around and hoping for the rain to start falling. One good way to increase your chance of seeing it rain is by checking another realms. Of course, we all don't have toons on multiple realms but you can check different realms with one toon, from one realm by using the &quot;in-game que&quot; that is used for finding a raid group for the Celestials and/or Ordos. Go to Jaguero Island, stand on the hill that is in the center of the island so you will have almost a complete view in your mini map. Face in the location where the only gorilla there is wondering around.(Can't remember his name) This is where most of the Baby Apes will be spawned;hit the &quot;O&quot; button. This will open the &quot;/who window&quot;. At the bottom right there will be a raid tab, click. Next window will have a &quot;other raids&quot; button, click. In this window you'll check the Celestials and/or Ordos. When someone sends you an invite make sure it's from a realm that isn't merged with yours and click accept. It will send your toon to that realm. Wait a few seconds for your toon to completely make the realm jump.<b>Beware: Your toon needs to be standing on the ground and not on a flying mount, flying. To be safe don't be mounted at all.</b> If it's raining, run to the nearest Baby Ape, fight and cage ASAP.

Raining on the Island is completely random, so it can be a bit irritating standing around and hoping for the rain to start falling. <br />One good way to increase your chance of seeing it rain is by checking another realms. Of course, we all don't have toons on multiple realms but you can check different realms with one toon. <br /><b>This is how:</b> By using the &quot;in-game que&quot; that's used for finding a raid group for the Celestials and/or Ordos. <br /><b>1:</b> Go to Jaguero Island, stand on the hill that is in the center of the island so you will have a complete view in your mini map. <br /><b>2:</b> Face in the location where the only gorilla there is wandering around.(Can't remember his name) This is where most of the<a href="/npc=61324/baby-ape">Baby Ape</a> will be spawned. <br /><b>3:</b>Hit the &quot;O&quot; button. This will open your <u>&quot;Who Window&quot;</u>. At the bottom right there will be a raid tab, click. <br /><b>4:</b>Next window will have a <u>&quot;Other Raids&quot;</u> button, click. In this window you'll check the Celestials and/or Ordos. <br /><b>Now,</b>when someone sends you an invite make sure it's from a realm that isn't merged with yours and click accept. It will send your toon to that realm. Wait a few seconds for your toon to completely make the realm jump.<br /><b>BEWARE: Your toon needs to be standing on the ground and not on a flying mount, flying. To be safe don't be mounted at all.</b> <br />If it's raining, run to the nearest <a href="/npc=61324/baby-ape">Baby Ape</a>, fight and cage ASAP. If not raining, leave raid group and RE-que for a chance at another invite from a different realm. This technique has been tested and proven. <b>It Works!</b> <u>Also, a chance of finding a blue rare is pretty good, assuming that the area isn't over camped by other pet hunters.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mking52</b></h3>started raining about 12:00am EST (11:00pm server time Sargeras). I was waiting about 30 minutes. It rained about 25-30 min. I found 3 greens (lvl9,9,10) 2 whites (lvl9,9), 5 greys (lvl9,9,9,9,10). My husband caught 2 greens (lvl9,10) he found his share of greys and whites too. There were 4-5 other people looking for the apes at the same time. There was a lot of time waiting around for them to respawn after they were all killed. But it was fun. I don't know that I will go back to farm a blue one any time soon but maybe after I finish everything else.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zophora</b></h3>Just confirming that I found my Baby Ape on Jaguero Island. It took me a few days of checking the Island at different times till it was raining and the Baby Apes showed up right away for 15 minutes. I tried for the 15 minutes to locate a rare and was unsuccessful. So I will keep trying for that. I don't remember the exact time. I had been checking at 6:30 and 8:30 specifically because someone above had commented that they found the ape around that time. When I found my Baby Ape it was only a quarter past the hour. Anyhow, I guess that is it. Good luck :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>littleblueflash</b></h3>While I was in Karazhan area getting the restless shadeling, I noticed that it was raining there when I came out of the underground area. So I flew down to the island to see if it was perhaps raining there. I had about a 15 minute wait after I got there, and the rain started. Was able to get my baby ape and fly my hubby's character down there from stormwind just in time to get one for him also.<br /><br />Not sure if there's any correlation to the rain between the two areas but figured I'd post it just in case... =)<br /><br />Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1252843</b></h3>Just got one. <br /><br />Been sitting on the island for two days, off and on. It's Sunday evening and the rain started around 6:57pm and ended at exactly 7:15pm.<br /><br />The rain was thick and loud. It got dark but you could still see the sky.<br /><br />There was one other person, and we cleaned them out in the first 3 or 4 minutes. Respawns are slow, I only saw another 4 maybe before the rain stopped. <br /><br />Mostly whites and grays, I got one green. The other player kept hunting the whole time so I assume they didn't find a rare either.<br /><br />Hope this helps, don't give up :) and good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>xoMishka</b></h3>Wow. I am INSANELY lucky. I'm on my lunch break right now, and I made a list of rare battle pets I needed so I could go home and park my alts. First place I went to was Jaguero Isle, and when I got there... OMG! IT WAS RAINING! I start frantically flying around because I can see people on the ground pet battling, and FHEWFKJWEFKL THERE'S A BABY APE! <br /><br />The first one I clicked on was rare.<br /><br />Omg.<br /><br />I win.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>246363</b></h3>Some battle pets are affected by quests/phasing! <br /><br />After camping Jaguero Isle for days with a level 85 mage, it finally began to rain, but there were no battle pets anywhere to be seen. Fortunately, the rain continued for several minutes... <br /><br />I flew back to Booty Bay looking for battle pets along the way and saw none, so I logged on with my main character on another account and using Boots of the Bay, I teleported the level 100 hunter to Booty Bay and then flew both characters back to the island. It was still raining but for the mage, there were still no battle pets to be seen, but for the hunter there were Baby Apes everywhere!<br /><br />After capturing a poor quality Baby Ape using the hunter, and then an uncommon, the rain stopped. Still using the hunter, I began looking for a Polly with the mage in tow. The hunter could often see battle pets where the mage saw none regardless of if he could see the mage or be seen by the mage.<br /><br />One primary difference between the two characters is the mage has the BWEMBA'S SPIRIT quest and has Bwemba's spirit following him, whereas the hunter has completed that quest and cannot see the spirit following the mage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kjeldor33</b></h3>After checking in here and there over the last few days, I thought, why not take advantage of the cross realm raid finder and try my luck. Just look for folks sharing their garrisons for the daily quests, and hop around until you find a server where it's raining. In about 10 minutes, I found two different servers. The first server, it stopped raining after I caught my first ape. The second, I was able to catch two P/P rares and a B/B uncommon. Rather than keep hunting for a B/B rare, I decided to hearth home.<br /><br />Good Luck, and may the XR be with you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kiyosue</b></h3>if you really enjoy leveling pets like i do and don't mind spending 2-3 hours there, this is what i do. i use the Rematch add-on, and put a couple dozen pets into the leveling queue. then i have two flying pets (two s/s rare crows), but any flying will do against the aquatics for powerleveling. i put my leveling pet into the first slot, then power level pets using the crows from 1-10 in order to level them further down the road like when we have the mini diablo garrison daily. <br /><br />using both pet buff experience treats you go from 1-10 in a few fights. by spending a couple hours here leveling pets you are almost guaranteed to come across a rain shower. i've been doing this on and off for a few months and nearly every time i'm leveling it rains there and tons of baby apes spawn.<br /><br />if you don't mind spending a couple hours leveling pets you can nearly guarantee a spawn by waiting it out. just hopping between realms and logging in every so often on a camped toon is giving you a slimmer chance in my opinion. have fun and good luck :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kendallzemp</b></h3>I had been camping for the Baby Ape on Jaguero Island forever, six months at least! By camping, I mean one toon is parked there on the island, and I check in as often as I think of it, which has been many times. Then I made a breakthrough. <br /><br />There is this lightweight add on called &quot;Cross Realm Assist&quot;, , which you can get (free of course) on Curse.com and probably other places too. It allows you to realm-hop, by joining pre-made custom groups with auto-accept. You can kind of screen the groups too, so that you're not joining a group that doesn't want realm hoppers. I prefer to use the ones that are offering garrison services (like &quot;come use my engineer's hut and the dust trader at my garry&quot;) and avoid the RP groups and other groups that are likely to summon me. Even though they often say &quot;Custom PvE&quot;, be aware that some of the realms will be PvP realms. I would not however let that deter you, because Jaguero Isle is not a big PvP place. :) Chances are that anyone else you find there is either questing or looking for a pet, like you. Stay on your mount, in the air if you can fly, until it's raining and you spy your Baby Ape to battle. The area where you will be battling has King Mukla, a bunch of adult Bonobos and some &quot;stealth&quot; panthers, who are level 33 or so. If your toon's level is significantly higher than them, it will make for a much easier time avoiding these mobs or killing them if need be. <br /><br />After getting the add on, I logged on my toon on the island, and started realm hopping. The first time I did it, I tried all the realms I could find (maybe 12 or so) and it wasn't raining anywhere. I spent maybe 15 minutes doing this. The second time I tried it, the fourth realm I tried, it started raining just as I arrived there. I was able to get my Baby Ape (a blue B/B first try, then the rest all seemed to be gray or white, but I wanted a P/B so I took a white one). I was probably lucky, because it rained for quite awhile after I got there, which is why I concluded that it only started around the time I arrived. People have all been saying that, when it rains, it only rains for about 15 minutes. <br /><br />After I did maybe 2 pet battles, I had a hard time finding any more baby apes to battle, even though there was only one other person there who was also looking to get a Baby Ape. She and I flew around looking and looking it seemed for about 5 minutes, maybe longer, and there were NO green paws on the map. All of a sudden it seemed a bunch more spawned, and I had a number to choose from. I only tell you this so you won't get discouraged and leave. <br /><br />Anyway, I highly recommend this method for getting your Baby Ape, and the add on has many other applications. It is MUCH better than sitting in front of your computer for hours, waiting for it to rain!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vee4Vampy</b></h3>This has literally just happened to me:<br /><br />at around 23:00 (00:00 game time) I thought id fly around pet hunting, and seeing i was near the cape of stranglethorn, I hoped it was raining. As I flew over, I noticed the rain, and got my hopes up, but then as soon as I reached the Isle, the rain and clouds disappeared.<br /><br />I double checked to see if this was natural, and of course it was.<br /><br />But as I was checking forums, I looked back into WoW, while resting on the isle, and IT BEGAN TO RAIN! (And as an EXTRA lucky bonus, the very first pe I targetted was a rare with random stats!) I know a lot of people said there are no triggers and you have to hope and wait, but, maybe, the fact that it was raining over the rest of STV, and waiting on the isle paid off, the rain soon approached. Maybe this is a sign to wait and hope it wont be long before the rain reaches the island, hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Drakkena</b></h3>Hopping on and off of my alts the past couple of days I finally managed to see it Raining on the Island on Dragonmaw. There were dozens of these little guys all over the island and my first was an Uncommon. Since it was raining I put in General Chat that it was doing so and had several other people come by to claim their little baby gorillas so they could make progress towards this achievement. This guy was the last I needed for the Eastern Kingdoms one so now I'm just waiting on that Snowy Owl and Minifernal for Kalimdor and then I'll have them all for Zookeeper.<br /><br />Just wanting to pass the word on that if it's raining giving players a tell in the General Chat would be nice as it means less people camping and waiting for these guys to get the achievement.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zaranae</b></h3>I got this pet within like 20 minutes or so.<br /><br />Easy way to do it: Use the &quot;Custom Group&quot; finder and join random groups that do some dailies or something like that on another server.

I had luck with like the 15th group I joined.<br /><br />It might not be the nicest thing, but it's very easy and possible to do it like this.</div>

I did other things with WoW running in the background so I could hear the rain, if and when it finally decided to start. Finally at 7:30pm server time, 3:30am local, I was so tired and frustrated that I went on a killing rampage, after 2-3 loops around the island it started to rain and the baby apes were everywhere! I battled till the rain stopped and was only able to get an uncommon, but the quest is done, finally. I suggest killing everything over and over, it seemed to trigger the rain. Good luck</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sluggy108</b></h3>I catched mine just before I started on this comment. I'll now try to list every relevant detail.<br /><br />Luckily, it started raining a minute after I got to the island.<br />It rained for 21 minutes<br />Nothing happened for 9 minutes. Got really nervous.<br />Then they started spawning by the truckloads.<br />After 12 minutes, the rain stopped and every baby ape despawned at the same time. It sucks because I held a custom group open to anyone who wanted this pet but they all disappeared before they could get here. This conflicts with a lot of other comments here so I'm not sure if it's a bug.<br />The island doesn't look like it's raining even if you look at it from the nearest shore.<br /><br />I highly recommend to just camp a character there while you watch TV or something. From my experience, logging in every 30 minutes could potentially make you miss this pet, though you would get it eventually.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>katcall</b></h3>I farmed this dang thing for the better part of a year, probably 4-5x/week, following all advice here with respect to certain times of the day the baby ape may spawn, and still no rainy island and no baby ape. The other day I showed up around 1:00PM server, found a rainy island, and a dozen baby apes running around. They exist but they sure are annoying to find for a beast pet that isn't even that great ability-wise.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tynael</b></h3>Today, 19th September 2017 I got my Baby Ape on The Maelstrom. The rain started at 19:30 and rained for like 30 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ksb16rn</b></h3>I camped out all day and at 1:00 am Dalaran server I decided to check one last time today and it was raining. I caught several poor and one uncommon before it quit raining. It stopped raining at 1:15 am so it must have started raining before 1:00 am EST.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Noctemus</b></h3>Got one today. A interesting fact is that was rainning, and while i was battling the first one i got (a B/B one) stopped raining. The weather changed while battling. When i got him, i start to search around (some guys said that would still has others till 15 min after the raing stop) to get a rare, and i was not able to find any single one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bomigabster</b></h3>Took the advice of those who recommended camping a toon on the island. From what I hear the rain is random but I had also read a couple of posts where the apes appeared at around 7 p.m server time, and as it was 6:30 p.m I figured I'd hang around for a bit and level some little ones. The rain started at 6:45 p.m and there were Baby Apes everywhere for about 20 minutes.<br /><br />It's a good place to hang around if you want to try to catch the ape as well as level some lowbies, I got a few from lvl 1 to lvl 10ish with a level 25 back up on the team. Gives you something to do while waiting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vehhuiah</b></h3>Raining now on the isle. Already opened a group, don't know for how long the rain will last. Goldrinn server. <br /><br />Jesus up a tree, that's some HEAVY rain.<br /><br />....and it's gone. Oh well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>silentlyfree</b></h3>The Jaguero Isle off the coast of STV is not guaranteed to rain when it's raining on the STV mainland. <br />I kept an alt parked and checked every now and then for the rain. Lightning's Blade 3am server time it was raining on the island.<br /><br />Most of the Baby Ape's were poor quality or common quality.<br />After checking all of the Baby Ape's only one of them was uncommon quality with the breed P/P.<br />However, since pets quality can be upgraded to rare, the uncommon quality was welcome!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>littlefish07</b></h3>I like to think the reason why they come out in the rain is because they like to play in it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Soulsseeker</b></h3>Caught two rains today on the isle, didn't see a single baby ape initially, and not a single one spawned throughout the rain phases. Maybe it's bugged in 8.0 and they don't spawn? I don't want to imagine someone purposefully wiped them all out both times just to be a jerk.<br />edit: caught a third rain phase in the space of ~5 hours, and this time the isle was full of baby apes from the start. Some massive jerk must've killed them all the previous times.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ShadowMorn</b></h3>I couldn't get this pet for what seems like ages, but today, on this sad and rainy day of summer, I decided to change my camping methods. Watching as tiny rain drops roll down my window I set the volume to 100% and play this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTQbiNvZqaY" rel="nofollow">masterpiece</a> for an hour straight. Being completely entranced by the visions of some long forgotten words and ancient melodies, I suddenly start hearing the drums echoing deep in the jungle. I hear a fatherly soothing voice tell me: &quot;Hurry boy, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=61324/baby-ape">it</a>'s waiting there for you&quot;. And then, as by the will of the God himself, It finally rains. Fueled by the zeal of my new-found revelation, I rush to the screen only to see little green paws appearing everywhere. Bless the rains down in Jaguero Island.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Drayline</b></h3>Just started raining at 1:05am (Argent Dawn), lasted less than 10 mins... Got unlucky and kept critting the baby apes to death in pet battle. .<br /><br />Edit: Luckily it rained again later that day! :3</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mananarik</b></h3>Ok, funny story. I logged in to on my mage, to see if the rain is. I was lucky that time, and indeed it was raining, after catching baby ape i went to Tanaris, to check if sand storm is going, i was very surprised, cuz it was, so maybe they have the same timer... also i checked Un'Goro Crater, for Ravasaur Hatchling, the nest for it was spawned too, so maybe they all have the same timer, cuz before i checked none was there</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thisbe</b></h3>Just for info, since Warmode in BFA (8.1), it can be raining in one mode but not in the other. I was camping the island in PVE mode, and it started raining. I called a friend to come get the pet, and they were in Warmode. The apes spawned for me, but not for them. Just something to note if you still want to try and camp this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Inumaru</b></h3>I've wondered this for a little while now, is the rain on the island a lot more rare than the snowing in <a href="/zone=67/the-storm-peaks">The Storm Peaks</a> is for the <a href="/npc=62864/arctic-fox-kit">Arctic Fox Kit</a>?<br /><br />I ask, because it didn't seem to take too long to get the fox... but I'm not sure if that was partially due to there being quests available in Storm Peaks so the time went by faster, versus just sitting around on the island.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zovesta</b></h3>I've kept an alt on this island for four years. FOUR. YEARS. I log on infrequently, but that's still a damn long time to be looking for a pet. My poor dwarf is insane and cannot return to civilization anymore--he has become one with the jungle and lives among the primates. Anywho, today, somewhere around 5:30-6 CST, I logged on and there was a single Baby Ape on the island! The first I had ever seen in these four long years! There was no rain, and I hurried to dismount and engage it in a pet battle. Whoops! All my pets were dead. I opened up my collection to put in a live one quickly and--the Baby Ape despawned. <br />I cried for ten thousand years.<br /><br />Update: Five straight hours of camping later, I finally got it. It was my last weather-related pet. Started raining at 2:50 AM CST... grabbed the first one I saw, then announced it in Stormwind so someone else can get lucky with it.<br />Unfortunately, the hunter is nothing without the hunt, and my dwarf remains alone and confused on that isle, unsure of what to do now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pneumonia</b></h3>I just got my baby ape after only one hour camping. <br />Went to the island around 9:20 server time (server: Nagrand) and it started raining exactly at 10:00am server time (exactly noon New Zealand time).<br /><br />I can confirm they spawn exactly when the rain starts, about 20 baby apes, and while it was raining in Jaguero Island it wasnâ€™t raining at the cape of stranglethorn.<br /><br />You can definitely see the rain even with the lowest graphic settings, and you can hear it too. Change your sounds settings to music:off and ambience:full</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Progcrafter</b></h3>I caught my baby ape. I had an alt on the island, and I would check from time to time. Then, I stayed logged on to that alt. I was doing pet brawls. I won one brawl. When that brawl ended, I saw that it was dark and raining. I flew around the island, and there were apes. This made me get the World Safari achievement.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kimaell</b></h3>The Baby Apes despawn as soon as the rain stops... This happened in front of my eyes while I was flying to tag one of them :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kirceratops</b></h3>Today, I stayed on this island from 2pm to 7:30pm wherein it finally rained. Don't stop believing and find something good to watch in the meanwhile &lt;3</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Poonkie</b></h3>I had 3 different alts on 3 different servers camping the island. I kept logging into each alt every few hours or so. After about 5 days it was raining on one server but no baby apes to be found. I was flying around the island for good 20 minutes before giving up. This is after 9.0.1 patch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Arkamedix</b></h3>I've caught him today but it was a bit strange: <br />I arrived Jaguero Island, it was raining, i saw a <a href="/npc=61324/baby-ape">Baby Ape</a> on the minimap then suddently it dissapeared (i think phasing maybe?). But the strange thing is that after i didn't saw any other <a href="/npc=61324/baby-ape">Baby Ape</a>, although it was raining. So i decided to try my luck, opened LFG, joined a random group and BOOM...10 <a href="/npc=61324/baby-ape">Baby Ape</a> around me. Sadly none of them was blue, all of them where grey or white (not even green)...guess i need to use a <a href="/item=98715/marked-flawless-battle-stone">Marked Flawless Battle-Stone</a>. <br />Anyway i am happy...this was the only &quot;conditional pet&quot; i was missing from my rooster..i was hunting him since almost 2 years.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Elaera</b></h3>I don't know if this information will do anyone any good but I just got the ape and it rained from 17:53 to 18:12. So around 20 min. <br />And there are A LOT of these little apes! Where I was standing it spawned like 5 right in front of me. So there's no trouble finding one even if it were to be other players there too.<br /><br />Speaking of, do try to write in the General local chat (shortcode /1 ) when it's raining so that others can get the opportunity too :D But maybe make sure you get one yourself first ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>renegadegirl</b></h3>I've been checking for weeks on my main server (Uldum) for the rain to catch one of these guys. After seeing a couple people recommend server hopping in this comments section, I decided to make an alt on another server (Blackhand) today just to park on the island. <br /><br />After checking 6 or so different times today, the rain started at 7pm server time on the dot and I was able to get a baby ape!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aquaserge</b></h3>Just to put this out there, the island has its own weather pattern separate from the Cape of Stranglethorn. It can be raining in CoS, but not on Jaguero Isle, and so if you're going to camp this be sure to do so on the island itself otherwise you might miss the rain.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>shotmachine</b></h3>For anyone who happens to be studying online right now, I found that running a character in the background camped on the island to work great. Not only are you watching lectures and farming this badboy at the same time, but the ambient noise present on the island is also actually amazingly calming while grinding away at recorded lectures. I am considering listening to it even after catching one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>CBMgaming</b></h3>Just caught a <a href="/npc=61324/baby-ape">Baby Ape</a> on Jaguero Isle. <br /><br />Date: 11-29-2021<br />Time: 8:38pm<br />Realm: Garrosh</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Marishke</b></h3>Here's how I got a rare Baby Ape (and two uncommons) today after four hours:<br /><br />1) Make sure whatever character you're on doesn't have Bwemba following you in Stranglethorn. If Bwemba is flying around with you, battle pets will not appear on the island.<br /><br />2) I flew five of my characters (on five different servers) to the island. Make sure your characters are at least lv. 30 to easily deal with the mobs there, as you'll need to kill the mobs around the Baby Apes before starting the pet battle to make sure your battle isn't interrupted by a stealth cat or monkey.<br /><br />3) I flew each character two lazy loops around the island to break up the monotony, mining and gathering as I went to pass the time, as I quickly noticed that immediately switching from character to character was driving me nuts and was pretty pointless. I spent maybe two minutes on each character.<br /><br />4) At around 7:30am server time, one of my alts saw rain. My third Baby Ape encounter was a rare. I had enough time for at least ten pet battles with Baby Apes before the rain stopped - at least 15 minutes of rain.<br /><br />5) Upon logging into another server, while hearthing, it also started raining there! I then caught two uncommons. However, the rain stopped very quickly on one of the servers, maybe 3-5 minutes.<br /><br />Altogether, three out of five servers I was on (Sargeras, Stormrage, and Zul'jin) all saw rain between 7:30-8:05am server time.<br /><br />I highly recommend turning on a TV show and just wandering from alt to alt. Eventually, it will rain. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jakobsson</b></h3>I have been camping here a few days now. And finally it started to rain! But not a single ape spawned anywhere...<br /><br />Update: While writing this comment it spawned! The spawnes were delayed 10 minutes after the rain had gone away for some reason.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Apolyptica</b></h3>I had been logging into some of my trial chars every now and then who are located on Jaguero Isle until I finally got lucky. <br />For some reason however the baby apes weren't showing up, only the regular pets were there. <br /><br />So I decided to quickly fly to Booty Bay and lo and behold, when flying back the Baby apes were now properly phased on the isle.<br />And I was super lucky as well, I did couple of fights and on my last fight before the rain disappeared, a rare one showed up, which I successfully captured. <br />The Eastern Kingdom Safari achievement was unlocked in the process using a trial character, so you don't have to worry about having to use some of your regular characters.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DCCXVIII</b></h3>Finally starts raining in STV only for the rain to de-phase the moment you get near the island that the Baby Apes are on. Fly back to the mainland, it rains. Fly back to the island, no rain. WTF is going on here?<br /><br />Edit: It appears the island has its own separate rain phase. You need to just camp the island and hope it rains.</div>
