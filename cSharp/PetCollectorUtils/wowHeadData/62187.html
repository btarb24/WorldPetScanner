<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Amberlynn</b></h3>They do indeed spawn in the dry riverbeds. I realise there is a lot of conflicting information about the spawn times specifically and that nothing is truly confirmed....but my experience was as follows:<br /><br />On several occasions I flew over the area looking for Stone Armadillos at various times throughout the day, <i>and never found a single one</i>. Once I went to check at 9:32pm server and there were none up that I could find (this does not mean there were none at all, it means there were none that I found personally). <br /><br />After a friend told me that he read they start to spawn around 7:30pm server time and de-spawn around 9pm server time...I set an in game alarm for 7:30pm server.<br /><br />When my alarm went off I finished up what I was doing and headed towards Desolace to see if these elusive little guys were out and about. I was flying over the area around<u> <b>8pm</b> </u>server time and they were literally all over the place. There were so many!<br /><br />I caught an uncommon quality one and left it at that, it's what I needed and a rare would have been nice but ah well. <br /><br />None of this is absolute confirmation that they only spawn at night, but it seems like a safe bet that from evening until early morning they are possibly up. I get the feeling they come out at night (or in the evening after the sun sets) and perhaps stay out until the day time. <br /><br />If anyone can confirm a time in the afternoon that they caught one, that would be great. So far the only times I've noticed have stated evening, night, or early morning hours. Though all that is still conflicting information because some people say PST, EST, and server times. <br /><br />I can say that these guys truly seem to be a primary pet. If you are having trouble finding one, don't bother hunting down the other battle pets in the area...just look for a Stone Armadillo specifically.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>fantisera</b></h3>Not sure I just got lucky or not, but as I took the flight path into Desolace I noticed two on the map near Thunder Axe Fortress. Quickly flew back there and picked one up at 60/25 at around 1:15am server time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Elynia</b></h3>Found about 3 of them skittering around 67,27 area a little after 8PM server time.<br />First one I fought was rare quality, so I trapped it and left. I'm guessing I just got stupid lucky on that (it's also how I got my rat as well).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>solidsnak</b></h3>I was there looking for it around 9:25pm Server (skullcrusher) time and i couldn't find it. I logged out and i logged back in at 10PM sharp server time and there was a lot waiting for me. Hope it helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LTygress</b></h3>As everyone else has said, and just like every other battle pet in Kalimdor, the key to these guys is that they only spawn during a certain time - AT NIGHT. However, night goes by SERVER time, not by local time. And many people think the server suggested to them when they began the game, is in their local time. <br /><br />Not so, anymore. With the combined servers for low-level areas, server time is likely to be different from where your actual server sits. Keep in mind that everyone you see in these low-level areas, will see the same mobs and NPCs. So when one of them starts spawning stone armadillos, all <i>connected</i> servers will start spawning them too.<br /><br />But if it's night time according to whatever time-zone they choose to &quot;set&quot; it in, then they will spawn. And they don't STOP spawning after an hour or two anymore. They are up all night - it's only about how hard they are camped.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Uern</b></h3>I just captured one of these at 2:45am server time just west of where the words &quot;Magram Territory&quot; appear on the eastern side of the post-Cataclysm Desolace map.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lunamoonraker</b></h3>Found one spawned at 6:35pm realm time (Bronze Dragonflight-EU). Location was (70,48) though it was mainly to confirm this earlier spawn time. On further searching there were plenty of others already up before 7.00pm</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sesh</b></h3>They spawn when the sun goes down no matter what time it is. I captured one at 6:00 p.m. on my server because I live on the West coast and that is what time the sun goes down in winter. However I anticipate that when the sun comes back (after Yule the days progressively get longer till the summer solstice) they won't be spawning till 9:00 p.m. in some areas, if no latter. Summer on the coast means the sun doesn't go down till almost 11:00 p.m. so I wonder if I come back to this place in June will I get a different spawn time than in January.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Malthmazar</b></h3>Not true that they spawn at night. I got one at 1:26pm server time. I was south of Thargad's camp.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kendallzemp</b></h3>There are several theories about when these pets spawn, and here is mine. I think they spawn when the sun in Desolace goes down. That is, when the virtual sun that you see in the game is totally down. I base that on what I read, integrated with what I saw today.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aquaria</b></h3>Caught this guy at 9:55am server time to complete &quot;<a href="https://https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=6590/world-safari" rel="nofollow">World Safari</a>&quot; (woo!).
