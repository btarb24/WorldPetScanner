This ability allows the player to avoid most damage for the round, although some first strike moves will still hit first. Also, previously applied debuffs like poison still hit the player, though multi-move attacks will miss (like Dive, Burrow, etc...).  Also, the moves have been redistributed so that slot one can be Crush\/\/Demolish, slot two can be Stoneskin\/\/Sandstorm, and slot 3 can be Rupture\/\/Deflection.  This is a very hard hitting pet, though with the changes this patch, Anubisath Idol has lost a bit of its edge since the removal of Reflection took a huge damage potential from this pet and the 5 others that shared this skill.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation for skills to use in PvP and Trainer\/wild pet battles is: \r\n1) Crush, due to the high damage and low miss chance, \r\n2) Sandstorm, due to the fact that it has a very similar effective damage reduction to Stoneskin, but is also a damaging ability.  It also can be used to effectively remove the opponents weather buffs (Cleansing Rain, Darkness, whatever) often completely killing the build of the opposing team if it is based off of a weather buff.  Additionally the Sandstorm buff keeps most periodic damage from doing anything and the passive Humanoid heal allows this pet to survive most incoming damage.\r\n3)Reflection.  This is the most effective way to avoid any major damage moves, and is superb at avoiding damage when multi turn moves are stacked to hit at the same time, as it avoids basically all new incoming damage from attacks that round.\r\nNote* If Reflection and Rupture were both available they would be my go to moves as they were pre patch, since Rupture has a stun that can proc, and does huge damage.  My experience however has been that survival and avoidance of the big hits from enemies is better than the extra damage and low possibility to stun.","date":"2013-03-12T01:26:23-05:00","rating":20,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":13,"id":1831696,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"249748","body":"5.2 changed his reflect to a deflect.

No matter what obnoxious tamer, be it in Northrend or Tanaan, this guy almost never fails to reduce every fight to a war of attrition. He's not just a wall, he's a mile wide, unscalable stone monolith. Absolutely essential for anyone who even kinda wants to get into Pet Battles. You don't need me to tell you that, look at any strategy for any tamer or legendary battle pet, his name comes up plenty. What I find to be interesting is that while he stands alone as an immovable object, he's absolutely awful in team building. \r\n\r\nFunny enough, I don't find many pets I'd say [i]directly[\/i] benefit from him on a team. [petability=453] is a decent weather for Humanoids who constantly heal, but the damage reduction isn't going to help any fragile pets endure an otherwise fatal hit while also knocking 10% off their chance to connect at all, making [petability=404] and [petability=596] arguably better choices. He's got a stun with [petability=814] but I find it to be vastly inferior to [petability=606] or [petability=624] which allow you to swap before the stun, giving an otherwise weak or gimmicky pet an opening to capitalize on or set up a combo. The only other thing of note is [petability=490] that would let him completely avoid damage for a turn (status effects not included). Again though, this doesn't necessarily directly benefit a [u]team[\/u] other than allowing you to mitigate overwhelming damage like [npc=73627] 's [petability=1036] something that any pet with [petability=764] or [petability=334] can do just as well. His other abilities are nothing to write home about.\r\n\r\nTo give an example of a (for lack of a better term) 'better' pet, [npc=51635]. Has the damage mitigation, stun chance, and dodge of Anubis, while also having debuffing poison and self healing. As a Critter it shakes off stuns without losing a turn and even has a good deal more HP than the Idol. With support to make up for its lackluster speed, this unassuming quest reward could do all of Anubis' jobs and then some!\r\n\r\nThis post isn't just to tear down Anubis though, as I acknowledged at the beginning that despite many clearly targeted nerfs he is still one of the strongest pets in PvE, but to illustrate what makes a pet good does not make necessarily make it good as part of a team and to point others towards alternatives that will hopefully help people struggling with some battles to compose new and better teams. I know [i]I[\/i] found making the jump from PvE to PvP annoying when suddenly I couldn't just wall everything due to someone's team combo crumbling my idol. Even challenges like the Celestial Tournament are far more frustrating when you come to rely so much on one pet that the rest of your pets suffer for it. The familiar things that make Anubis a standout solo pet are on other pets with far more varied, team friendly move pools. Don't be afraid to experiment! Half the fun of pet battles is using ALL your critters to win.\r\n\r\n[small][i]Feel free to disagree, though I'd rather hear other thoughts on the matter than a simple downvote. I tried to make this comment informative about the pet and it's uses, rather than just regurgitating drop-rate info, so I appreciate feed back. \r\n\r\nI was prompted to write [i][b]this[\/b][\/i] particular comment in response to someone else complaining they were sick of seeing Anubisath Idol on every tamer page and that they felt pet battling was stagnant and tedious rather than fun. Pet battling is loads of fun! And a good part of that fun is learning to adapt and changing up your teams. If you're not having fun playing with Anubisath Idol or spaming Howlbowb then try something new! You might just stumble on the next 'must use' combo.

It drops off the Twin Emperors of Ahn-Qiraj, specifically Vek'lor, so make sure to damage him when going after them.  The twins can be taken solo at level 90, trivially at level 100, so there's not much of an excuse to not get it personally rather than purchasing it from the Auction House, though if a string of bad luck or an unwillingness to march out to the insect-infested rear end of Azeroth that is Silithus drives you there, it will probably set you back a few thousand gold -- not much by modern standards, but painful if you don't have at least one garrison running treasure missions or perhaps if you're reading this from a Legion or later future in which gold isn't quite so easy to come by.\r\n\r\nThe Anubisath Idol is the perennial favorite tank of the Battle Pet world.  As you explore the harder challenges of pet battles, you'll find it's one of the pets that comes up again and again for defeating such elite foes, and when it does it will always be with the same set of moves: Crush, Sandstorm, and Deflection.  This combination enables the Anubisath to outlast nearly any other pet: Sandstorm reduces the damage taken from each attack and near-perfect uptime (perfect if the Anubisath is faster than its foe, which it won't be).  Deflection has a very reasonable cooldown and allows you to evade any large hit you are able to predict.

CM Brennvin said the following on a forum post (I added the bold font):<br /><br />&quot;We believe there was a lot of confusion when we originally announced this change and we're certainly at fault for said confusion. The original patch note was very vague to the point of being misleading. It was never our intent to weaken old raid boss encounters to allow anyone to have a chance to solo them, regardless of class, spec, or skill. <br /><br />What we did change were encounters that were mechanically impossible for one person to accomplish, solely for the purpose of ensuring players have easier access to the hunt for the new rare companion pets -- <b>the drop rates of which are actually set to account for a group of three players, not one.</b><br /><br />Moving forward, though, we do not plan to adjust encounters for tougher raid bosses to be soloâ€™able by all classes and specs.&quot;<br /><br />(Source: <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7199913648?page=3#58" rel="nofollow">http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7199913648?page=3#58</a>)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>499847</b></h3><div class="quote-box">The reason he disappears is because you never hit him. You have to hit him with at least 1 magic attack or else he despawns when they die</div><br /><br />Thank you RagnarkEnd for this. For everyone soloing these bosses, make sure you hit each boss with one attack / spell before killing them. If you do not, you are not eligible for loot.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>971612</b></h3>This little guy is incredibly strong. He managed to solo a full group of three level 25 epics from Pandaria while still being 23. And yes, that was a daily quest fight, not a random wild one.<br /><br />Reflection is also always cast first, so it is entirely possible to powerlevel the Idol by using it on the first turn. Just use reflection then switch to any other pet, he'll be tagged for experience and won't suffer any damage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1074023</b></h3>Excellent pet!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mantrhax</b></h3>As usual Blizzard is trying to destroy the fun playing this pet....again<br /><br />who asked for ability swap ? not me<br /><br />Before i was doing all dailies everyday, now i just stopped doing it, probably ill get bored again with the game, i think its what blizzard is trying with this change, spoil the fun and make people hate then more and more<br /><br />Update 2 : Looks like this isnt the only change, i bet there are some undocumented changes on pet battles as well, looks like the dodge and miss increased, well, thats what happens when de design has a flaw.....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bluecatcxl</b></h3>With patch 5.2, the ability Reflection has been changed to Deflection. This ability allows the player to avoid most damage for the round, although some first strike moves will still hit first. Also, previously applied debuffs like poison still hit the player, though multi-move attacks will miss (like Dive, Burrow, etc...). Also, the moves have been redistributed so that slot one can be Crush//Demolish, slot two can be Stoneskin//Sandstorm, and slot 3 can be Rupture//Deflection. This is a very hard hitting pet, though with the changes this patch, Anubisath Idol has lost a bit of its edge since the removal of Reflection took a huge damage potential from this pet and the 5 others that shared this skill.<br /><br />My recommendation for skills to use in PvP and Trainer/wild pet battles is: <br />1) Crush, due to the high damage and low miss chance, <br />2) Sandstorm, due to the fact that it has a very similar effective damage reduction to Stoneskin, but is also a damaging ability. It also can be used to effectively remove the opponents weather buffs (Cleansing Rain, Darkness, whatever) often completely killing the build of the opposing team if it is based off of a weather buff. Additionally the Sandstorm buff keeps most periodic damage from doing anything and the passive Humanoid heal allows this pet to survive most incoming damage.<br />3)Reflection. This is the most effective way to avoid any major damage moves, and is superb at avoiding damage when multi turn moves are stacked to hit at the same time, as it avoids basically all new incoming damage from attacks that round.<br />Note* If Reflection and Rupture were both available they would be my go to moves as they were pre patch, since Rupture has a stun that can proc, and does huge damage. My experience however has been that survival and avoidance of the big hits from enemies is better than the extra damage and low possibility to stun.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>249748</b></h3>5.2 changed his reflect to a deflect. Huge nerf</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Supacharged</b></h3>So, I queued up for a random pet battle.. guy I was versing had 2 of these (level 25) and 1 level 23 snake. Managed to take down the snake no problem. Got to this guy, and he managed to alternate between his 2 lvl 25 pets enough to take down my lv 25 Rock Viper and lv 25 Restless Shadeling (both rare) which left just my level 24 Marsh Fiddler. I used Swarm (3 round ability, 3 hits per round) 5 times before dying. During this, I hit the idol all of 0 times. Ouch. Didn't make it through 1 anubisath idol, let alone the second</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>78194</b></h3>His <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=453">Sandstorm</a> ability makes this guy a great pet to powerlevel other pets. While standstorm is active *most* pets will block all damage from 3 round abilities such as <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=66741">Grand Master Aki's</a> pet <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=66728">Chirrup</a> and his <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=706">Swarm</a> ability. This allows you to swap in low level pets during the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=706">swarm</a>/<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=163">stampede</a>/<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=581">flock </a>type abilities, take no damage and swap back out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TevishSzat</b></h3>Changing Reflection to Deflection was, yes, a nerf. However, this is still a very powerful pet. I personally favor Crush/Sandstorm/Rupture: though one could make a good argument for deflection and winning through pure persistence, I personally find it is useful in general and for humanoids especially so to do damage with every action, and Rupture gives the Idol a new heavy damage action as well as a third type of damage. It is for the same reason I don't like Demolish on the idol: &quot;High Chance to Miss&quot; moves are risky at the best of times, and when you lose the racial healing as well as the action it's insult to (lack of) injury.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>GoRozZo</b></h3>Actually, this pet can win solo 1x3 in pvp of three 25 lvls. You can watch my video where i killed all three pets only withAnubisath Idol without any switches:<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYEDpfrAcSQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYEDpfrAcSQ</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thecanman</b></h3>The pet's namesake comes from <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Anubis_standing.svg" rel="nofollow">Anubis</a>, the Ancient Egyptian God of embalming the dead. Anubis was a man with the head of a Jackal. The pet is named after him (<b><u>Anubis</u></b>ath Idol), and looks just like him to boot.<br /><br />OK, now that we got that useless bit of trivia out of the way, let's talk about the pet. He has a number of uses. He has means to mitigate damage through reduction effects (Sandstorm/Stoneskin/Defelction), his big health pool (he only comes in the H/H breed), can deal big humanoid/elemental damage, and as a humanoid pet type, will heal himself for 4% (which equates to 69 hitpoints at level 25) after each successful attack. And to boot, whenever you're up against a beast pet, you can change the humanoid damage for mechanical damage, which is far more effective, at the cost of hit chance. He is a battlepet tank, so to speak.<br /><br />He is a great choice for taking on the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=68463">Burnng Pandaren Spirit</a>. When he brings out his dragonkin pet, you bring this out. Cast Sandstorm to mitigate Cyclone, use Deflection to avoid Lift-Off, spam Crush which will hit it hard. Combine him with a Faerie Dragon and a Snail/Strider and it's a walk in the park.<br /><br />And protip: Whenever you use Demolish, don't use sandstorm at the same time. Just don't.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>smackthekids</b></h3><i>As someone who played the living heck out of Pokemon Red/Blue, but never really got into Pet Battling due to the overwhelming amount of pets and abilities,</i> <b>THIS GUY IS FOR YOU!</b><br /><br />He is an absolute behemoth with an extremely simple set of abilities that can just about solo anything the massive world of Battle Pets can throw at it aside from certain Undeads. <br /><br />He has passive self-heals, a huge health pool, and a perfect set of 3 abilities that keeps him going strong (and with full HP) the entire fight with:<br /><ul><li>A strong attack with a chance to stun,</li><li>A hard hitting weather effect to reduce all damage to all your pets (and completely negate most Damage Over Time (DoT) effects down to 0 damage, and</li><li>An &quot;always goes first&quot; shield to completely stop all damage when you see a pet charging up a strong attack</li></ul><br /><br /> - You can literally just put up Sandstorm to cut the enemy's attacks into laughable damage, spam ability #1 all day long, and then use your deflection if you see you're about to take a lot of damage.<br /><br /> - He is also great for capturing pets, and even better for leveling your own pets! Enter combat with your low-level pet, and then switch to Anubisath, and Sandstorm will ensure your other pets resist AoE/DoT/multi-target attacks while they're inactive and sitting out after the 1st Round. Nothing is more frustrating than getting 0 Experience when the enemy kills your inactive pets from AoE/DoTs or weather effects and you have to revive and start over.<br /><br />If you are like me, and had no clue where to start with Battle Pets, GO GET YOUR <a href="/npc=68659/anubisath-idol">Anubisath Idol</a> NOW !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1396713</b></h3>This pet is still good in WoD?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1533088</b></h3>I'd love to say this pet is overrated, but even after countless nerfs he is still the undisputed king of PvE. No matter what obnoxious tamer, be it in Northrend or Tanaan, this guy almost never fails to reduce every fight to a war of attrition. He's not just a wall, he's a mile wide, unscalable stone monolith. Absolutely essential for anyone who even kinda wants to get into Pet Battles. You don't need me to tell you that, look at any strategy for any tamer or legendary battle pet, his name comes up plenty. What I find to be interesting is that while he stands alone as an immovable object, he's absolutely awful in team building. <br /><br />Funny enough, I don't find many pets I'd say <i>directly</i> benefit from him on a team. <a href="/pet-ability=453/sandstorm">Sandstorm</a> is a decent weather for Humanoids who constantly heal, but the damage reduction isn't going to help any fragile pets endure an otherwise fatal hit while also knocking 10% off their chance to connect at all, making <a href="/pet-ability=404/sunlight">Sunlight</a> and <a href="/pet-ability=596/moonlight">Moonlight</a> arguably better choices. He's got a stun with <a href="/pet-ability=814/rupture">Rupture</a> but I find it to be vastly inferior to <a href="/pet-ability=606/elementium-bolt">Elementium Bolt</a> or <a href="/pet-ability=624/ice-tomb">Ice Tomb</a> which allow you to swap before the stun, giving an otherwise weak or gimmicky pet an opening to capitalize on or set up a combo. The only other thing of note is <a href="/pet-ability=490/deflection">Deflection</a> that would let him completely avoid damage for a turn (status effects not included). Again though, this doesn't necessarily directly benefit a <u>team</u> other than allowing you to mitigate overwhelming damage like <a href="/npc=73627/lil-oondasta">Lil' Oondasta</a> 's <a href="/pet-ability=1036/frill-blast">Frill Blast</a> something that any pet with <a href="/pet-ability=764/phase-shift">Phase Shift</a> or <a href="/pet-ability=334/decoy">Decoy</a> can do just as well. His other abilities are nothing to write home about.<br /><br />To give an example of a (for lack of a better term) 'better' pet, <a href="/npc=51635/scooter-the-snail">Scooter the Snail</a>. Has the damage mitigation, stun chance, and dodge of Anubis, while also having debuffing poison and self healing. As a Critter it shakes off stuns without losing a turn and even has a good deal more HP than the Idol. With support to make up for its lackluster speed, this unassuming quest reward could do all of Anubis' jobs and then some!<br /><br />This post isn't just to tear down Anubis though, as I acknowledged at the beginning that despite many clearly targeted nerfs he is still one of the strongest pets in PvE, but to illustrate what makes a pet good does not make necessarily make it good as part of a team and to point others towards alternatives that will hopefully help people struggling with some battles to compose new and better teams. I know <i>I</i> found making the jump from PvE to PvP annoying when suddenly I couldn't just wall everything due to someone's team combo crumbling my idol. Even challenges like the Celestial Tournament are far more frustrating when you come to rely so much on one pet that the rest of your pets suffer for it. The familiar things that make Anubis a standout solo pet are on other pets with far more varied, team friendly move pools. Don't be afraid to experiment! Half the fun of pet battles is using ALL your critters to win.<br /><br /><i>Feel free to disagree, though I'd rather hear other thoughts on the matter than a simple downvote. I tried to make this comment informative about the pet and it's uses, rather than just regurgitating drop-rate info, so I appreciate feed back. <br /><br />I was prompted to write <b>this</b></i> particular comment in response to someone else complaining they were sick of seeing Anubisath Idol on every tamer page and that they felt pet battling was stagnant and tedious rather than fun. Pet battling is loads of fun! And a good part of that fun is learning to adapt and changing up your teams. If you're not having fun playing with Anubisath Idol or spaming Howlbowb then try something new! You might just stumble on the next 'must use' combo. Good luck and happy monster ranching!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>leviatan1</b></h3>Anyone farming this pet more than 5 times? i cant get it to drop :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Twinsen21</b></h3>His &quot;Crush&quot; ability can't, it really really <b>can not</b> be 90% hit chance with Sandstorm up, because I swear I miss like 1/4 of my attacks <i>every. single. fight.</i>. And I've done a lot of them with this pet. With needing this pet to beat many tamers this really annoys me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TevishSzat</b></h3>If you are getting into Battle Pets, do yourself a favor and get an Anubisath Idol. It drops off the Twin Emperors of Ahn-Qiraj, specifically Vek'lor, so make sure to damage him when going after them. The twins can be taken solo at level 90, trivially at level 100, so there's not much of an excuse to not get it personally rather than purchasing it from the Auction House, though if a string of bad luck or an unwillingness to march out to the insect-infested rear end of Azeroth that is Silithus drives you there, it will probably set you back a few thousand gold -- not much by modern standards, but painful if you don't have at least one garrison running treasure missions or perhaps if you're reading this from a Legion or later future in which gold isn't quite so easy to come by.<br /><br />The Anubisath Idol is the perennial favorite tank of the Battle Pet world. As you explore the harder challenges of pet battles, you'll find it's one of the pets that comes up again and again for defeating such elite foes, and when it does it will always be with the same set of moves: Crush, Sandstorm, and Deflection. This combination enables the Anubisath to outlast nearly any other pet: Sandstorm reduces the damage taken from each attack and near-perfect uptime (perfect if the Anubisath is faster than its foe, which it won't be). Deflection has a very reasonable cooldown and allows you to evade any large hit you are able to predict. Crush is nothing special but it has a 100% base hit rate and the Idol's Humanoid typing enables it the heal at the end of any round in which it dealt damage, which Crush is good at providing. The Idol laughs off both teams that do a lot of little hits and ones that do infrequent burst damage. It can be worn down, especially when its own sandstorm causes it to miss several uses of Crush in a row, but doing so is a herculean effort or at the very least rarely the job for a single pet.</div>
