The Owl is a direct counterpart to the Qiraji Guardling and it spawned from November to February.  Despite the fact that several GMs claimed this was a bug, and because of the fact that no blue has to-date come out and said in a straight forward way what \"summer\" and \"winter\" mean in terms of these pets [neither the traditional seasonal definition nor the traditional Warcraft definition, I can tell you that much already], it is reasonable to guess we'll be seeing these pets spawn between May and August.  In other words, like the Owl, spawning about a month and a half before summer begins, and ending bizarrely a half a month before the real summer actually ends.\n\nETA: Keep in mind, nothing is confirmed until the day this actually spawns.  I don't care what a GM tells you about it; GMs have given six different answers and are unlikely to know any more than we do.  Personally, I plan to check on the first of May, not June, and recommend you all do the same.\n\nETAÂ²: Thanks to Lentesh below I found [url=https:\/\/twitter.com\/mumper\/status\/314939609819803648]Mumper's[\/url] [url=https:\/\/twitter.com\/mumper\/status\/314939998468186113]tweets[\/url] regarding the seasonal pets.  He's still quite vague but it sounds now like the Qiraji Guardling will be going to a Summer Solstice to Autumnal Equinox schedule.  I'm still going to check it out on May 1st, but it's sounding now like we're going to have to wait for June 21st after all :(\n\nETAÂ³: Final edit, as many of you know [b]the Qiraji Guardling is finally in game[\/b].  As Mumper suggested, it was added on the 21st of June [and one blue post on the matter suggested strong that it will cease to be available when Autumn begins on the 20th of September].  Although it was a rare spawn [as in hard to find, not Blue] when it first went live, a hotfix went live on the 24th of June ensuring that they would be much easier to find.  On a personal note, when I went down there, there were a good dozen or so to choose from, so it seems as though the hotfix did the trick.

At that time, 7-8 spawned a few minutes apart and after they were captured, no more spawned. It would seem that the rumor of the 5-6 hour spawn timer is true, and the reports that killing critters helps is mere coincidence?\n\nI can personally confirm that they do spawn on both sides of the Scarab Wall, both sides of the Scarab Dias and on each side of both portals into the instance. They also spawn on the paths leading up to the two instance doors. They do NOT spawn inside the instance or but they DO spawn above the instance. They DO spawn as both primary and secondary pets.\n\nUPDATE: At 6:30 am (so 6.5 hours since the initial spawn) I saw three more, then I got mine at 6:45. Not really sure what that says for the spawn timer theory. At this point, I feel like we're all just guessing. But good luck to everyone! My spawn was poor quality. I plan to use a Battle-stone on it so that I don't have to take spawns from other people. I would encourage others to do the same. Right now, the important thing is to get one of any quality to complete the achievement.

Qiraji Guardling basically has the same huge number of breeds that Flayer Youngling does.  It would be best to practice patience than to suffer frustration at this time.  Non-Battle collectors will trickle away on their own as they get their achievement credit.\r\n\r\nSome noteworthy breeds for this pet include:\r\n- 1725\/260\/260  Basically use like Anubisath but with Reckless Strike instead of Rupture, imo the best Sandstorm breed\r\n- 1400\/325\/260  Moderately low speed, hits hard, probably the best stats if you're fond of Whirlwind and not Sandstorm\r\n- 1400\/260\/325  Max Speed variant for 2-turn stuns on Blackout Kick\r\n- 1400\/289\/289  Balance of power and speed, has ups and downs with pretty much all the moves\r\n\r\nIn general, Reckless Strike is one of the better selling points of this pet.  Crush's shaky accuracy is always a vulnerability, especially during Sandstorm.  You can use this pretty much exactly the same as Anubisath, except the much shorter cooldown on Reckless Strike lets you keep a stronger offensive presence.\r\n\r\nWhirlwind, in all fairness, is basically unusable.  Due to the turn cooldowns on 3\/4 of the other move slots (and Sandstorm countering your own Whirlwind), and Hawk Eye not actually DOING anything except every 4 turns, taking Whirlwind basically leaves you juggling 4 other options with cooldowns.  You can Whirlwind, Blackout Kick, then swap, but such frequent swapping defeats the purpose of Blackout Kick as well.  If you're fond of Whirlwind, Curious Wolvar Pup is another Humanoid with the move, and Deathtalon Whelpguard has it as well, and both come with the 1400\/325\/260 breed, but with movesets better able to support Whirlwind use.","date":"2013-06-21T11:26:23-05:00","rating":41,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":97,"id":1868976,"nreplies":3,"sticky":0,"user":"Hemingray","body":"[b]Edit: Hotfix notes for June 24: \"Qiraji Guardling's spawn rate has been greatly increased.\"[\/b]\n\nI rescind my previous statement below.

Before queing make sure you are in the area\/zone that you want to farm for the rare pet!

For years I wish I could tame one with a hunter and if I can manage to find this pet, then it'll be a pet I'll proudly display everywhere I go!<br /><br />Sadly it seems I have to wait til Summer. :\</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wamo</b></h3>Can be found at the Scarab Wall outside Ahn'qiraj in Silithus. They are one of the seasonal-dependent battle pet spawns, and spawn only during the northern hemisphere's <b>summer</b>, so around late June to late September.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LostDrewid</b></h3>The unfortunate thing about this being a summer-only pet is that the expansion - and pet battles with it - is released <i>one week</i> after the end of summer.<br /><br />Guess whether you want this pet or no, the Zookeeper title will be unobtainable for <s>nine</s> some number of months.<br /><br />So a quick update, as there is confusion regarding both this pet and the <a href="/npc=7554/snowy-owl">Snowy Owl</a>. The Owl is a direct counterpart to the Qiraji Guardling and it spawned from November to February. Despite the fact that several GMs claimed this was a bug, and because of the fact that no blue has to-date come out and said in a straight forward way what &quot;summer&quot; and &quot;winter&quot; mean in terms of these pets , it is reasonable to guess we'll be seeing these pets spawn between May and August. In other words, like the Owl, spawning about a month and a half before summer begins, and ending bizarrely a half a month before the real summer actually ends.<br /><br />ETA: Keep in mind, nothing is confirmed until the day this actually spawns. I don't care what a GM tells you about it; GMs have given six different answers and are unlikely to know any more than we do. Personally, I plan to check on the first of May, not June, and recommend you all do the same.<br /><br />ETAÂ²: Thanks to Lentesh below I found <a href="https://twitter.com/mumper/status/314939609819803648" rel="nofollow">Mumper's</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mumper/status/314939998468186113" rel="nofollow">tweets</a> regarding the seasonal pets. He's still quite vague but it sounds now like the Qiraji Guardling will be going to a Summer Solstice to Autumnal Equinox schedule. I'm still going to check it out on May 1st, but it's sounding now like we're going to have to wait for June 21st after all :(<br /><br />ETAÂ³: Final edit, as many of you know <b>the Qiraji Guardling is finally in game</b>. As Mumper suggested, it was added on the 21st of June . Although it was a rare spawn when it first went live, a hotfix went live on the 24th of June ensuring that they would be much easier to find. On a personal note, when I went down there, there were a good dozen or so to choose from, so it seems as though the hotfix did the trick. Happy hunting, everyone!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SFFCorgi</b></h3>As a trivial note: They used this model for some of the Mantid mobs in Beta (haven't got to the right place to see what they look like now).<br /><br />I always thought they looked like insectile versions of harpies.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>brionl</b></h3>During beta, they were also spawning south of the wall in the Ahn'Qiraj sub-zone.<br />The best part about that is pets south of the wall only spawn as singles. They don't bring any friends, easier to capture.<br />When Summer finally rolls around again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jaxsonbateman</b></h3>What makes this being currently unobtainable even worse is that it's one of three creatures that you can get via in-game methods that has Reckless Strike, which is a very, very good flying move. And one of the other two creatures, the Tirisfal Batling, is uncommon rarity. So effectively, if you want to have different creatures with Reckless Strike (perhaps for levelling alts in Vale of Eternal Blossoms), you need to settle for the uncommon Tirisfal Batling. If you want to have two <b>rare</b> pets with Reckless Strike, you pretty much either have to have a pet obtained previously/outside the game, or go with two Bats.<br /><br />While I'm fortunate enough to have a Vampiric Batling, I don't envy anyone who has to make that choice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1082746</b></h3>Hey hiltzster I just wanted to point out that the Summer Solstice for the Northern Hemisphere is in June, not March.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>244088</b></h3>4 months away from Zookeeper title. Can't wait to capture this Battle-pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Elethea1</b></h3>Pops up only during summer, and is not obtainable until next summer due to expansion release. Is also a requirement for like two or three acheivements. This is going to get ugly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Eillesthis</b></h3>All information about when this pet will be available is speculation, because we haven't had a summer since the expansion was actually released. It may be available:<br /><br />Weather summer - June, July, and August<br />Calendar summer - summer solstice (June 21) to autumnal equinox (September 22)<br />Holiday summer - Memorial Day (May 27) to Labor Day (September 2)<br />WoW fishing summer - vernal equinox (March 20) to autumnal equinox (September 22), like the <a href="/item=13756/raw-summer-bass">Raw Summer Bass</a><br /><br />This last one seems the most likely to me because it's the one based on something that happens in the game, but again, I'm just speculating. And all of these assume the Northern Hemisphere, although that's a safe bet for North American servers at least. We will know when someone actually sees one.<br /><br />Edit: Turns out it was the <b>summer solstice (June 21)</b>! Presumably it will disappear on the autumnal equinox (September 22) because it wasn't up when Mists launched on September 25, 2012. However given the fits and starts with the <a href="/npc=7554/snowy-owl">Snowy Owl</a> that could have been in error, so...it's still just speculation. We will know when they disappear.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shiva20</b></h3>Why isn;t it here yet, in the snow owl topic a gm confirmed the snow owl is gone due to seasons, so this should be poppin up left and right.....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1106361</b></h3>Judging by the lack of Snowy Owls as I'm searching for them in Winterspring AND by the comments in the entry for Snowy Owl, Blizzard defined &quot;Winter&quot; arbitrarily for that battle pet as November 1st through Feb 28th. (...despite that not matching any of their other definitions of winter, nor any standard definition of winter. Good jorb, Blizz.)<br /><br />So I imagine that Qiraji Guardling will show up May 1st through Aug 31st, keeping a four month window that doesn't match any definition of &quot;Summer&quot; anywhere in-game or out.<br /><br />My timing for working on Kalimdor Safari could not have been better! /sarcasm</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>249748</b></h3>Brace yourselves, summer is coming</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1031185</b></h3>Nothing yet....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sugarbaby</b></h3>It is 3:13 am Pacific standard. <br /><br />It is 20th of March here (it been the 20th all day too) and no sign of the guardling. <br /><br />Booooo!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Moosplauze</b></h3>Since I jumped to AQ very soon after the server came up and I couldn't find any Qiraji Guardling I battled all other random BattlePets in the area. Still no Guardling, so I wrote a GM ticket.<br />The Gamemaster told me, that spring started in WoW in February and Summer will not start before June. I asked if he is 100% sure about the information he was giving and he answered that he can only say so much, because it would be unfair to other players if he would give me more information. -.-</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Stetheleh</b></h3>Ok, i contacted a GM, too. Granted, it was about the snowy owl, at march 19, asking him if summer starts(and winters ends) march 20(as it is for the fishing thingies, and since wow has only two seasons) and basically, he told me that he couldn't disclose that information about seasonal pets cause it's a &quot;game hint&quot; as he called it, but he did say that the seasons in wow regarding these pets (snowy owl, qiraji guardling) are similar to the real life seasons. that's it.<br /><br />So, since no qiraji guardlings have appeared, i'm guessing that, indeed, winter ends last day of february and summer starts first day of june.<br /><br />Having said that, happy hunting, people. I'll still check every now and then if they are up.<br />After all, there was a bug with snowy owl, so, never know.</div>

Why do we have to wait 8+ months just to get this one last pet. It completely sours the fun process of achieving &quot;zookeeper&quot;.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1113154</b></h3>I wish people were not so quick to blame Blizzard for everything. They are running a game.

They did not do anything out of malice, but business. Cut them some slack. They never said you had to stick around to get this achievement, you decided that.

We will get through this, we are World of Warcraft players, we've been waiting and have been at the mercy of Blizzard for 8 years now.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ElliotHunts</b></h3>How to increase your chances with the multitude of other campers. (assuming they don't read this too :P) <br /><br />1. Use this targeting macro: <br />/cleartarget<br />/tar Qiraji Guardling<br />/stopmacro <br />/script SetRaidTarget(&quot;target&quot;,6)<br /><br />2. Go to keybindings and bind your 'Interact with Target' to something easy to reach. I bound to middle mouse button. <br /><br />I flew around spamming my macro which I put on my 1 keybind. Then my macro found one and put the square raid marker on the Guardling. A dozen other pet battlers flew toward it as well but I managed to grab it first due to my binding of 'Interact with Target' spammed like crazy on my middle mouse button. <br /><br />Alternatively you can sit in one spawn point and spam your macro. Either works.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>954889</b></h3>I was sitting at the Scarab Wall for about 10 minutes, and I would kill all the critters that would spawn. About 9 minutes into my onslaught, one spawned, and I managed to get it. While I was fighting the Guardling, a second spawned, and someone grabbed that fairly quick.<br /><br />Killing the other critters can't hurt your chances, and the few people who have done so seem to have increased chances. Another thing I was thinking, but it is merely speculative is that they spawn in pairs, one not long after another. <br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Alaurynn</b></h3>So I've been camping since midnight PST. At midnight straight up, several spawned and were quickly captured. Then none spawned all night, even though we killed all the critters in the area over and over, until about 5:45 am. At that time, 7-8 spawned a few minutes apart and after they were captured, no more spawned. It would seem that the rumor of the 5-6 hour spawn timer is true, and the reports that killing critters helps is mere coincidence?<br /><br />I can personally confirm that they do spawn on both sides of the Scarab Wall, both sides of the Scarab Dias and on each side of both portals into the instance. They also spawn on the paths leading up to the two instance doors. They do NOT spawn inside the instance or but they DO spawn above the instance. They DO spawn as both primary and secondary pets.<br /><br />UPDATE: At 6:30 am (so 6.5 hours since the initial spawn) I saw three more, then I got mine at 6:45. Not really sure what that says for the spawn timer theory. At this point, I feel like we're all just guessing. But good luck to everyone! My spawn was poor quality. I plan to use a Battle-stone on it so that I don't have to take spawns from other people. I would encourage others to do the same. Right now, the important thing is to get one of any quality to complete the achievement. We can worry about rarities and breeds later when things have calmed down a bit.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: My husband got his rare after just 15 minutes by killing the critters that spawned on top of the instance behind the doors. Each time he would kill 10-15 critters, a Quiraji would spawn. He repeated this process until he got his rare. I have updated my post to reflect his findings.</div>

CRZ makes it ludicrous. I would recommend waiting for a server restart as I am betting it works the same as other pets (like Minfernal) where they will be plentiful if you can get in right after a server restart. Be warned that since this is CRZ'd your home server may not come up at the same time that the CRZ comes up so you may still be late, but it has to be better than this...<br /><br />Just park a toon at the wall and wait for a restart...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ohgasauraus</b></h3>Why is there no map link to this entry for the spawn point of the pet?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>496978</b></h3>If you're out hunting this for World Safari, you may get lucky and not have to wait TOO long depending on your CRZ.<br /><br />If you're intending to hunt this for actual pvp pet battle use, don't even try right now. Qiraji Guardling basically has the same huge number of breeds that Flayer Youngling does. It would be best to practice patience than to suffer frustration at this time. Non-Battle collectors will trickle away on their own as they get their achievement credit.<br /><br />Some noteworthy breeds for this pet include:<br />- 1725/260/260 Basically use like Anubisath but with Reckless Strike instead of Rupture, imo the best Sandstorm breed<br />- 1400/325/260 Moderately low speed, hits hard, probably the best stats if you're fond of Whirlwind and not Sandstorm<br />- 1400/260/325 Max Speed variant for 2-turn stuns on Blackout Kick<br />- 1400/289/289 Balance of power and speed, has ups and downs with pretty much all the moves<br /><br />In general, Reckless Strike is one of the better selling points of this pet. Crush's shaky accuracy is always a vulnerability, especially during Sandstorm. You can use this pretty much exactly the same as Anubisath, except the much shorter cooldown on Reckless Strike lets you keep a stronger offensive presence.<br /><br />Whirlwind, in all fairness, is basically unusable. Due to the turn cooldowns on 3/4 of the other move slots (and Sandstorm countering your own Whirlwind), and Hawk Eye not actually DOING anything except every 4 turns, taking Whirlwind basically leaves you juggling 4 other options with cooldowns. You can Whirlwind, Blackout Kick, then swap, but such frequent swapping defeats the purpose of Blackout Kick as well. If you're fond of Whirlwind, Curious Wolvar Pup is another Humanoid with the move, and Deathtalon Whelpguard has it as well, and both come with the 1400/325/260 breed, but with movesets better able to support Whirlwind use.</div>

The highest health of all my lvl 25 pets is the Crawdad @ 1887. Roaches and the Scourged Whelp are second with 1806. So The Guardling looks to be 3rd in highest health. I've used her a few times now @ lvl 25 and she is pretty solid. Reckless Strike deals 420 at lvl 20 which is decent as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Amberlynn</b></h3><u><i><b>Please do not kill Qiraji Guardlings on purpose!</b></i></u><br /><br />No matter what you have read <i>anywhere</i> it is better to allow people to fight and tame (or accidentally kill) them. <br /><br />Targeting and killing them is <i>not helping</i>.<br /><br />Allow people the chance to actually tame them. <br /><br />Please let others tame their pets and get their achievements and titles. <u><b>If</b></u> clearing spawns helps more to spawn, then allow others to tame or accidentally kill them via pet battle. This would help the spawn rate to the same effect.<br /><br />Edit: This misunderstanding may have been formed by the fact that it <u><i>might</i></u> help force spawns by killing critters and other battle pets in the area. I ran around killing critters and saw other people killing the snake and scarab battle pets in the area and after doing so I witnessed 2 people fighting and taming Qiraji Guardlings. This is not concrete confirmation, but it seems there may be some validity to the idea. Since Guardlings seem to be primary only I would like to ask....<b>has anyone seen a Guardling as a secondary pet</b>? I have been personally avoiding killing battle pets specifically because I simply do not know.<br /><br />Thanks auntmousie for testing it out. As far as I've been able to tell by asking around (I have personally only caught 2, and one was right after server maintenance when no one else was around because the servers were up early) and reading up on it...it is highly unlikely to spawn as a secondary pet. Not that it matters as much at this point since they did up the spawn rate and complaints about it have started to stop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sinestra139</b></h3>What's wrong with you Blizz? We have been waiting months for this pet. Why not make it a spawn fest so that we can all get our pet and title? Surely insects such as this should spawn in masses. Instead we are left to waste hours, days and possibly weeks to compete with dozens of other players for the rare spawn to turn up. Its a very miserable way to spend midsummer, even more miserable than the weather!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sidhebane</b></h3>I think Blizz dropped the ball on this one. As a long-anticipated seasonal pet, they had to know that it would be highly-sought after, purely for achievement's sake (Rather than on its own merits), and that there would be a LOT of people aftre it. And yet, even for these opening days, they leave it on this sort of minfernal-ish timer? <br /><br />How does that add to the game, making everyone who wants to complete their collection have to camp for hours? Sure, it gets us online, but we're certainly not enjoying ourselves with a game we want to recommend to our friends. It simply makes us frustrated, and changes our reaction to others from &quot;Grats, you got it!&quot; to &quot;You bastard, that was my spawn!&quot;<br /><br />This is not a &quot;rare, special, hyped&quot; pet like the val'kyr. This is just the last goddamn pet we need to finish our ach. It's already arbitrarily restricted by having us wait ten months to get it. Why give it a spawn rate so low? If anything, it should have had a spawn BOOSTED for the opening days, like quest mobs at the start of an expansion. <br /><br />Isn't having a bunch of happy gamers showing off their pets to their friends and guildies, a better result than a bunch of frustrated campers complaining &quot;Nope, can't tank for you, the f___king this still hasn't spawned&quot;</div>

I keep getting killed, but when I die I'm apparently inside the AQ instance, but when I go to my corpse, it says I'm not in the instance. I'm having to take res sickness, &quot;run out&quot;, which apparently is really in, then out again to get to where the pets are. <br /><br />If anyone else is running into this, please let me know. It's kind of bothersome.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Decabah</b></h3>Given that this is the last pet that people need for their achievement and that so many of us were looking forwards to being <i>done</i> with insane camping afterwards, I'm surprised at Blizzard for their glib &quot;rares are rare lol&quot; responses.<br /><br />Fine, rares are rare. Rares are next to impossible when there are 28 -- I counted -- people in a small area, all hoping for a needle in a haystack when that needle may or may not spawn in the next two hours and you may or may not get it depending on your luck, latency or whether you happened to blink at that specific moment.<br /><br />I don't want pets handed to me, I like to work for them. But I like to be <i>able</i> to work for them, and even after one day I can tell that the spawn rate/amount isn't cutting it.<br /><br />Edited to add: downrate me all you like, but you know I'm right.<br /><br />Having said all of that, I received mine at 37, 55 at 5:45am exactly on Whisperwind shortly (5 minutes or so) after seeing a goblin DK kill a Quardling in the exact same spot so hopefully someone else can benefit from that information.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nagassh</b></h3>After having my main realm be plagued by CRZ, I ended up having the most luck by using one of my alts that happened to be on a low pop RPPVP server (Ravenholdt EU), I saw a grand total of 3 people there, none of which stuck around for long before a guardling spawned.<br /><br />While pvp servers carry the obvious drawback of the possibility of being pvped out of pet battles, it seems the threat of that is keeping said realms so sparsely populated that it's not super likely - rolling a DK on a low pop RPPVP realm might be the easiest way to go about getting a guardling.</div>

Uncommen quality, will use a stone on it to make it rare so others have a chance to get one of their own.<br /><br />It spawned in a corner on the sands on the left side of the stairs to AQ40 (left side if you are approaching the instance) I made a target macro for targetting it, it seems so tiny on the sand that i thought i accidentally targeted a snake but a second look made me realise it wasn't a snake.<br /><br />Very happy zookeeper over here :)<br />This pet makes number 500 of unique pets for me!<br />Have a nice weekend :)</div>

I camped the spot for about 4 and a half hours and it was just my luck to find it. I cannot confirm it shows up as a secondary pet nor can I confirm any other locations, only this one. My suggestion: just camp that area, since there is a second theoretical location right by it I read about above. I have never camped any other rare pets I have captured, only this one, and given the amount of people looking for it at this particular time, it seemed to work for me just to sit in one spot and let everyone else fly around. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bladden</b></h3>I would like to point out that I just acquired this pet, a lvl 15 common. It's stats when caught were 147 power, 132 speed, 834 health. This does not match any of the breeds listed as possible at this date (22/06/2013), it does however match breed 7 exactly. This would indicate that this breed does indeed exist for this pet, if rare (or just not reported yet?), and needs to be added to the database one way or the other.<br /><br />P.S I would do it personally, but the wowhead client doesn't work for me.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tamiller</b></h3>I have seen several people suggest making DKs on low pop realms to work on catching this guy.<br /><br />While it is possible that could work, keep these things in mind:<br /><br />You're looking at 1.5-2 hours to get your DK out of the starting zone (not too bad).<br />You will not be able to fly in Silithus/AQ unless you are willing to level to 60, and somehow acquire a bunch of gold to pay for flight training. (ouch)<br /><br />You can certainly catch the pet without flying, but if there are other campers, you will almost certainly lose the race to the spawn unless you get very, very lucky.<br /><br />It's probably better to just wait until the camping situation on your own server dies down a bit.

It was poor quality, but I have battle stones to upgrade for a reason. I wanted to see if killing critters in AQ would force a spawn. The pet seems to only spawn as a primary pet, so I killed any critter I could. Within 30 minutes the little humanoid bug spawned. Your results may vary, but at the least if you get bored hunting this guy feel free to take it out on the scarabs and sidewinders.<br /><br />Also wanted to add that this pet can be breed #4 P/P.

I validated the fact that the spawn rate for this pet has indeed increased. I'm on server Proudmoore-US and my tip is to stay at coord. 50.8, 12.3 and be patient. 4 Guardling spawned in 1 hour, average wait time of 15 min. <br /><br />There are other spots that's spawning of course, like near the summoning stone. I know, because you can sense the joy of the players when they blurt out in the chat, GOT ONE! In succession. It seems that their righteous anger is a thing in the past from frustration of long &amp; boring camping hours.<br /><br />It's sad Blizzard did not anticipate to increase the spawn rate from day 1. A lot of players now has distant trust to the very creator of this wonderful game.<br /><br />I hope that Blizzard will learn from this experience. Your loyal paying players does not deserve this kind of treatment.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>flaotinging</b></h3>With the hotfix it probably does not matter to note such things but I've observed that they spawned en masse at 4am server time (Brazilian server) and then again 45 minutes later. Of course, they spawn at various intervals in between as they get snatched up or killed but, suddenly... Qiraji at 4:00am and 4:45am; maybe 5:30am will see another spawning?<br /><br />If so, 4:00, 4:45, 5:30, 6:15, 7:00 and repeat every 3 hours server time to be part of a mass spawning could be a thing.<br /><br />Just a theory and probably incorrect - but if anyone else can corroborate it would be interesting to know.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>355273</b></h3>The spawn rate has been ridiculously increased. So I started checking for rares and killing them afterwards because there were so many of them. I killed about 30 and got a rare H/S.<br />By the time it took for me to write this 4 new ones spawned just in my vision radius.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Laichzeit</b></h3>As of june 24th, 2013, the spawn rate has been hotfixed.<br /><br />Just went there to see if there was still a lot of people...green paws...green paws EVERYWHERE!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Fieora</b></h3>Respawns of this have been greatly increased, there were four people battling inside the walls, just infront of the raid entrances. <br />I killed a few Scarab Hatchling critters and a quardling spawned within 10 seconds.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>caylithe</b></h3>I caught mine this morning, right after Moon Guard came back up. Out side of the Meeting Stone on the road. <br />When I logged in, there were 4 of the pets spawned... I took my time and made sure my battle pets were healed and then picked the one that kept flying back and forth in front of me. When the battle came up... the lil guardling was RARE... I was so excited... I was able to capture him and easily defeat the 2 snakes that spawned with him. <br />I captured him approximately 0710 central time. <br />Thank's Blizzard for the restart and the boost to the spawn time.... <br /><br />but... now about those darned minfernals.......................................................</div>

So glad they increased the spawn rate. Now on to getting a level 25 team!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1012488</b></h3>Whereas the other seasonal pet, the Snowy Owl spawned so widely and unpredictably across Winterspring as to make farming a rare a very un-sporting thing to do to other players: the guardling is now so plentiful and spawns in such a concentrated area free of hostile mobs you may feel free to farm them at your leisure and even use them to level other lowbie pets. Just be sure to have a Terrible Turnip or low-level pet in your team to insure you don't kill the rare one when you find it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1047029</b></h3>OK ALL! READ THIS POST! Guaranteed to save you several hours of farming for rare spawn pets! Works 100%! 5.4+ patch<br /><br />So here is a method to farm ANY WORLD SPAWN PET OR WORLD RARES and do it in about 5-10 minutes <br /><br />First in World of Warcraft press &quot;O&quot; and go to Other Raids Tab and que for Ordos and Celestial raid or any popular world raid boss! Once you get picked up you transfer to that server...which hopefully one of the rares has spawned on that server... If not leave group and re-que for a different group. Took me 3-4 times before finding a server that has the the rare spawn pet or world rare spawns. Eazy as pie...<br /><br />Tip: to speed up the que time enter a high item level in comments you get picked up in less than 40 secs. Before queing make sure you are in the area/zone that you want to farm for the rare pet! Also the above method works for rare world spawns...farming...and other stuff.<br /><br />Also if you find this HELPFUL Please login and BUMP or Promote! Protipz!</div>
