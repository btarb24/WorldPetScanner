So thought I'd post to clear it up.<br /><br />All you need is 2 Dark Iron Ale Mugs. Go to the quest giver at the darkmoon faire, (Morja) she stands near the First Aid quest giver. Lay ONE mug down at her feet and wait. Even if the mug despawns before jubjub gets there.. he will still do the drinking action and an ! will appear over the quest giver. Click on her, then click accept to trade your second ale mug in for the unhatched egg.<br /><br />If you bought ten .. sell the other 8 on the ah, or give 4 to two other alts because you can own 3 jubjubs.<br /><br />My one question as I wait for my first three eggs to hatch is.. is this pet crateable?</div>
