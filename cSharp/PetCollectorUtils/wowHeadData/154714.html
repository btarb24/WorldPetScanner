<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ozyorkbourne</b></h3>I'd advise that if possible you pursue this one quickly and probably at night, before others start going for them. I'd been dreading this but did it at 2am server time and found two in two minutes. Both of them rare quality. tried giving it away but couldn't, so I took that to mean all the enthusiasts have them while those who don't care much haven't bothered yet. 3-4 days in to a patch is a great time to go after these rarer pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>neekthehunter</b></h3>Kay, this one is a bit hard to get. It seems that only one can be up at any time, so get ready for some flying. I scouted the entire zone several times without spotting one, so I decided to take down some Deeptide Fingerlings, since they appear in same area, and since they are like Bloodseeker. After a while it appeared at 30.35, and I got it easily.<br />My guess is that you will always get a Blue/Rare one...but I'm not going to spend more time looking for another just to see if it's green ;-)<br />GL on getting it and it will probably be one of the last ones you need for the Naz Safari achi.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jeolene</b></h3>Came here to see why I had never caught this one before only to find out that you are supposed to kill other critters to get one to spawn, but I only killed a few hydras in the area where I found one and didn't kill anything else.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>selkie47</b></h3>Bloodseekers can be found as main pets in the battle pet group (not as an additional) so just fly around and look at names.

I put my character near the edge of the waterfall and the game automatically shifts the character's position always to the edge of the waterfall but never off the edge. It was here I battled the three trash mobs. After that I started the pet battle and won a blue P/P variety.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zeffira</b></h3>After running to all the spawn locations of Deeptide Fingerlings, killing them off as suggested, and then waiting for them to respawn as Bloodseekers, and doing this for hours and days with no success of a Bloodseeker spawning, I thought of a strategy. Since they are &quot;bloodseekers&quot;, I thought perhaps if I use a pet that causes the Deeptide Fingerling to bleed when battling it, perhaps it would bring back a Bloodseeker when it respawned... I know, crazy, right? The very first time I tried, I used a Bucktooth Flapper which caused the Deeptide Fingerling to bleed, then followed with an attack of &quot;blood in the water&quot; on a Deeptide Fingerling already captured. Upon respawning, lo and behold the first Bloodseeker I had seen in 3 days of hunting. Coincidence? All I know is I'm happy to have the achievement FINALLY!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Orwaa</b></h3>Took me 2 days but I got mine at 46/39. I tried killing all the Deeptide Fingerlings and even did the Blood in the Water trick with Bucktooth Flapper and Deeptide Fingerling. I collected Ore to kill time as I had killed so many pets that very few were up at all. Not sure which if any worked but I got one. It was even a blue!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lumaris1989</b></h3>Found mine at 75/31, as from alle the others comments it was a rare with PP-Breed. I made circles around the rivers and killed all Deeptide Fingerlings, both Battle Pets and normal critters.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Stollentroll</b></h3>This one drives me entirely insane. Not only the Deeptide Fingerlings sharing the spawn points are not killable outside of Pet Battle, the area ist obstructed so often that I can't even kill them in PB so I am running around Nazjatar, screaming at waterfalls FOR TWO WEEKS now, starting to think that one is a myth and was only invented by Blizzard in an elusive scheme including this page to drive me crazy. No other explanation possible.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Exephia</b></h3>Finally got it today. I decided to try the method of battling each Fingerling and then forfeiting and after 65 (today - 300 total) It spawned in place of a fingerling at the 3 waterfalls near Abyssal Pool.<br /><br />/way 46.46, 36.05<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TomCat</b></h3>After many hours circling the zone and only clearing the battle pet version of Deeptide Fingerling (battle the pet, kill the Deeptide Fingerling, and then forfeit), I realized that I can spawn more battle pets by also killing the critter version of Deeptide Fingerling. After one full lap clearing both types of Deeptide Fingerling, I started to do a flyover of the whole area, not killing anything, to see if the Bloodseeker had spawned anywhere. I found it fairly quickly.<br /><br />TLDR; Kill every deeptide fingerling once, including the critters and battle pets. To kill the battle pets, you have to find a spot on the shore near each one to initiate battle and just kill the first fingerling and forfeit. Once you've done a full lap doing this, fly back around everywhere and you may very well find the Bloodseeker. It took about 30 minutes for me to get one once I changed my ways and stopped ignoring the critters.</div>

Later, while finishing up Nautical Nuisances, I found another around 57,40. Seems like there is much less competition for them with WM turned on.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Traoth</b></h3>This is the worst thing I've had the displeasure of experiencing. I killed every Deeptide Fingerling in both WM and no WM. I've done this for 6 hours now, not a single Bloodseeker. The respawn times are so long and the fact I have to pet battle each Deeptide is so frustrating. They completely changed the rules for this pet compared to other rare pets that share a spawn pool with another pet. Why can't we just kill them like normal? Why is everything become a tedious time waster?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SamashNZ</b></h3>Already im so sick of this pet. Its ridiculous. I've been going for 4 hours. Killed about 30-40 Deeptide Fingerlings more maybe? Lost count... I'm done.</div>

I went to each point one by one killing only the critter version of the Deeptide Fingerling. After going to each point I hit the waypoint macro again and started point to point again and on this second round I found my Bloodseeker, took a total of about 10 minutes.
