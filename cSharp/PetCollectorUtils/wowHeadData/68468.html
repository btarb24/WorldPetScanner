The nice thing is that you can level a level 1 pet this way as your weak pet won't take any damage.\r\n\r\n1) Start with your low level pet.  Attack once, but it will get stunned and not attack (it will still get credit though).  Swap in your next pet.\r\n\r\n[i]If you have a strong enough pet, you can leave it out for one more turn in order to soak the big hit the enemy does next, which will make the rest of the fight easier, but this is not necessary to win.  The rest of this strat assumes you swapped after the initial stun.[\/i]\r\n\r\n2) The trick pet for this part of the fight seems to be Squirrels of any sort.  \r\n\r\n[i]As a critter, it takes reduced damage from the elemental's attacks and takes limited negative effects from the stuns.  Basically, if you're slower than the enemy, when he stuns you, he spends one turn to stun you for one turn, and there's no net loss.  If you're faster, you attack, he stuns you, and it wears off by next turn, meaning the enemy actually wastes a turn by stunning.  I've been able to beat this trainer with several different critters due to this, but none were really super reliable until I found Squirrels.[\/i]\r\n\r\nIf you have the choice, you will want a Squirrel that's faster than 334 speed, out-speeding the enemy critter.  I personally have found a standard [npc=61081 domain=www] with 341 speed.  You need your Squirrel to have Woodchipper and Nut Barrage.  If you're faster than 334 speed, use Crouch.\r\n\r\n[i]If you're slower than 334 speed, use Adrenaline rush.  I'll explain the strat for a faster pet as it's more reliable.  However, I want to make 2 notes about the slower Adrenaline Rush strat.  You don't need Adrenaline Rush to be active immediately in the fight, but you do need Adrenaline Rush up before the enemy uses his abilities that can stun for the reasons mentioned above (occurs 3 turns after the first time he uses the large hitting ability).  Second, make sure Adrenaline Rush is active when you kill the elemental.  If you wait long enough on the first Adrenaline Rush, one Rush should cover both of these[\/i]\r\n\r\nTurn 1) On the first turn, use Woodchipper.\r\nTurn 2) On the second turn, use Crouch.  Note that delaying the Crouch by one turn is on purpose; this causes the final turn of it to line up with the elemental's hard-hitting ability.\r\nTurn 3+) Use a cycle of Nut Barrage when it's off cooldown; if not, Crouch; if not, Woodchipper.\r\n\r\nIf you've done things correctly, Nut Barrage should have at least a few turns of its dot available, your critter should be alive with any amount of health (probably pretty low), and you should have first attack on the next turn.\r\n\r\n3) The enemy will now bring out his Critter.  The goal here is you need to knock off roughly 1\/3 of its health with your Squirrel, but the enemy critter's opening attack hits extremely hard.  As long as you're faster than the enemy Critter, you should be able to Woodchipper (which is Beast vs. Critter), and then the damage of Woodchipper and Nut Barrage's dot will knock off a large portion of the enemy's health before it wears off.  Your Squirrel dies.\r\n\r\n4) Swap in your Mechanical pet.  [spell=103544 domain=www] is a common pet that will work (Missile\/Minefield\/Ion Cannon), but I found [spell=65682 domain=www] to be better (Missile\/Minefield\/Extra Plating).  They both work under the same concept, but Warbot does a good bit more damage than the Tonk does and has access to Extra Plating.\r\n\r\nIf using Warbot, use Extra Plating as often as possible.  In either case, get Minefield down and then Missile the enemy Critter to death.  Mechs take reduced damage from 2 out of the 3 of the Critter's attacks, so this shouldn't be too hard.  The goal of this part of the fight is you need to kill the Critter with Minefield in place and without proccing your mech's survive-death ability.\r\n\r\n5) The enemy Beast comes out.  If using the Tonk, immediately Ion Cannon.  If using the Warbot, Missile the first turn, Extra Plating the second (if it's available), Missile the third.\r\n\r\nThe way this places out is this.  In either case, the Burrow will probably \"kill\" your mech, but you'll proc the survive-death ability.  By the end of this turn, whether you used Ion Cannons or multiple missiles, the enemy Beast will be under 100 health.  He'll Stone Rush, kill your Mech, but the damage he does to himself will kill the Beast as well.  You'll still win because your level 1 pet is alive.  Despite how close of a call this is, it's surprisingly repeatable.","date":"2013-03-16T12:05:36-05:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":11,"id":1839190,"nreplies":12,"sticky":0,"user":"jjanchan","body":"[b]UPDATED for 5.3![\/b]\nHere's a guide to beat this trainer with only 2 level 25 pets, allowing you to \"carry\" and power level a third!\n\n[b]Step 1:[\/b] You will need a rabbit pet with >300 Speed at level 25.  The best candidates are [i]just[\/i] over 300 speed, which is fast enough, while maximising the other stats.  Certain breeds of rabbits will work best (Rare breeds 3, 11, 12).  If hunting for the correct breed is not your thing, you can also use a [npc=32791], which will have enough speed even at  uncommon rarity and is very easy to acquire.  If, like me you are lucky enough to have [npc=59358], even better, as he is already rare!\n\n[b]Step 2:[\/b] You need a mechanical with Beast attacks to finish off Sludgy.  I have found the [npc=68838] works the best.  I will write this guide using this pet, although it can be applied to other mechanicals - just be sure to select at least one strong Beast type ability.  Easy to acquire alternatives include [npc=43916] and [npc=15699].\n\n[b]Step 3[\/b]: Have your carried pet handy - place it in the first battle slot so it starts.\n\nHere is the setup you want to run:\nSlot 1 - [Carried Pet]\nSlot 2 - [Rabbit of your choice] : [petability=360] | [petability=312] | [petability=159]\nSlot 3 - [npc=68838] : [petability=429] | [petability=923] | [petability=536]\n\n[i]Enemy Team Summary[\/i]\nPandaren Earth Spirit : [petability=569] | [petability=814] | [petability=801]\nSludgy : [petability=448] | [petability=450] | [petability=445]\nDarnak the Tunneler : [petability=436] | [petability=159] | [petability=621]\n\n[b][u]Pandaren Earth Spirit[\/u][\/b]\n\nBelow is the ability order that this pet uses against you.\n1. [petability=569]\n2. [petability=814]\n3. [petability=801]\n4. [petability=801]\n5. [petability=801]\n6. [petability=801]\nRESTART AT STEP 1\n\nAs your rabbit is a critter, it takes reduced damage from Elemental attacks AND the Crystal Prison will really do nothing to the critter as CC is less effective against critters!  You want to avoid [petability=814], since it hurts.  The way to do that is as follows.\n\nUse your carry pet to soak round 1 and 2*.  Switch in your rabbit (round 3) and use [petability=159] for rounds 4-5 (You will avoid one [petability=801] and soak one the following round).  Next use [petability=360] for two rounds (round 6 and then back to round 1), then use [petability=312] to avoid the [petability=814] in round 2 (and also the following [petability=801] on round 3!).  Use [petability=360] for round 3, and then start again with [petability=159] on round 4-5 (as listed above), rinsing and repeating till the Earth Spirit is dead!\n\n*NOTE: The [petability=814] in Round 2 as listed above will deal about 500-550 damage to your carried pet, or about 350 if they are a critter (takes less damage from Elemental attacks).   So, unless they are Mechanical (will resurrect after taking a killing blow) or Magic (can only take a maximum of 40% of it's health in a single hit) you will want to make sure your carried pet has enough health to withstand a hit!\n\n[u][b]Sludgy[\/b][\/u]\n\nMechanicals take less damage from 2 out of 3 of Sludgy's attacks, and when possessing a Beast type ability, can put out a lot of damage to get him down quick.\n\nWhen Sludgy comes out, switch to your mechanical - in this case [npc=68838].  The strategy with the [npc=68838] is very straightforward - [petability=536], then [petability=429] till Sludgy is dead.  It may well be that your mechanical dies or is very close to death by the time Sludgy goes down - that's ok.\n\n[u][b]Darnak the Tunneler[\/b][\/u]\n\nBelow is the ability order that this pet uses against you.\n1. [petability=436]\n2. [petability=159] (Submerge)\n3. [petability=159] (Emerges)\n4. [petability=621]\n5. No ability (all abilities on CD)\n6. [petability=621]\nRESTART AT STEP 1\n\nTime to bring your rabbit back in to work his magic!  The precise setup of abilities selected for your rabbit means that it will take ZERO damage from Darnak.  Here's how.\n\nSwitch your rabbit back in as soon as Darnak comes out; he will do [petability=436] when you do so.  Next use [petability=360] for one round, and when Darnak submerges, use [petability=312], which avoids not only the [petability=159], but also the following [petability=621] on round 4!  Continue with [petability=360] for rounds 4 and 5 (round 5 is a free shot round, Darnak doesn't even do anything!) and finally [petability=159] for round 6, which avoids [petability=621].  Now rinse and repeat your way to a win!\n\nAs one of the hardest trainers out there, this method will be a sure fire way to farm experience and bags day after day.","date":"2013-04-04T23:10:21-05:00","rating":45,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"How am I the first to up-vote this well written, detailed, precise, and most of all accurate comment?!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>helver</b></h3>After trying to put together a team to counter this guy's pets, but failing miserably, I built a team to basically survive the elemental. What he'll do is first thing, he'll cast a stun. Then he'll cast a damage plus chance of stun attack. So what I did was use a team of:<br /><br />Golden Civet Kitten<br />Garden Frog<br />Kun-Lai Runt<br /><br />The civet lead off, surged, ate the first stun, then switched out for the Frog. The Frog hit Water Jet a couple of times, managed to dodge some attacks and when he got stunned, I brought the civet back in. The civet finished off the elemental and did some damage to the critter. When the civet was dead, I brought in the runt to finish off the critter and do some damage to the beast. Once the runt was dead, I brought the frog back in. He had a lucky dodge but managed to finish off the beast.<br /><br />This fight was, to me, harder than the Pandaren Fire Elemental. You definitely have to figure out a way to deal with all the stuns that you'll encounter.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1067881</b></h3>you can use a lv 25 rare Eternal strider and combined cleansing Rain with pump. <br />if a pet dies you bring him in ready to attack second round with pump this move always go first and that will one shot the Thundering Pandaren Spirit! with mighty 1890 DMG boyah!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kalenmiyan</b></h3>Man, I struggled against this bastard for so long!<br /><br />My winning combination was:<br /><br />Disgusting Oozeling<br />Ravager Hatchling<br />Fel Flame (Lil' Ragnaros works too).<br /><br />Against the Earth Spirit, I had my Oozeling hit him with Acidic Goo and Corrosion, then Absorb. He'll still win the first match, but it sets up nicely for the Ravager to get in there with Devour. The next pet you'll face should be the spirit's own Oozeling. Ravager is a Beast type, so no problem there. Finish with Devour if possible for a nice hp boost.<br /><br />Against his rat, use Screech to slow him down and then follow that up with Rend. You'll probably die, but you've saved the best for last; Have your Fel Flame (or Lil' Rag) use Immolate, and follow that up with Conflag. That should get him low enough that you can just finish him off with a Burn or two. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>690507</b></h3>As with all of the pandaren spirit fights, the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=64352">Whelk</a> is amazing against the elemental - it takes reduced damage, has the critter stun resistance, has a dive ability to avoid one potential stun, and hits hard. Keep the Acidic Goo up, use Dive on cooldown, and Goo will tick him down should you get stunned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1070312</b></h3>Mr.Bigglesworth is really recommend for the earth elemental, it's Ice Tomb stuns and deals 1.4k++ dmg when combined with the pets ability 'Prowl'. And since the pet is faster than the Elemental you will always be able to cast Ice Tomb before you get stunned by the Elemental.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rakesha</b></h3>Finally beat this Grand Tamer just now. I used the following in order of how they are in my setup:<br /><br />Leopard Tree Frog - Rare - Lvl 25<br />Rapana Whelk - Rare - Lvl 23 (Lvl'd to 24 when I beat the trainer lol)<br />Kun Lai Runt - Rare - Lvl 25<br /><br />Was a bit easier and I honestly believe the Whelk is a must. Made the fight SO much easier!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Manishtusu</b></h3>Rabbits are amazing against the elemental. Start with dodge to avoid both stun attacks, burrow, eat some of it's basic attacks (which doesn't hit for much on a critter) and repeat. I usually finish with above 50% health.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Spectreofwar</b></h3>I'll add my winning combination as well. I started with the Earth spirit as my first of the four tamers, so after the first few tries I was overwhelmed. I mixed and matched opposing types and still got stomped by their huge power and hitpoints. Eventually I broke out an old themed pet group consisting of:<br /><br />Anubisath Sentinel<br />Flayer Youngling<br />Voodoo Figurine<br /><br />The combination of two Reflections means that, as your first action whenever you face the elemental, your opponent is going to swap (since the AI hates leaving a stunned pet to be damaged no matter the circumstance). The Flayer youngling eats the ooze alive, reflecting the first attack and then rampaging for the rest.<br /><br />The rat didn't have much to say against either the flayer or the sentinel. The Voodoo Figurine was impressively good against the elemental, and that extra life after dying was the last hit he needed. The Figurine was my only casualty.<br /><br />I went on with this configuration to beat the other three trainers with no second chances needed, each fight was easier than the Earth one. Stun was a P.I.T.A, but turning it against them worked very, very well!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1062573</b></h3>Ok, so, for those looking to 2-pet this trainer, I've found a way to do it in patch 5.2 It's harder than in 5.1 and leaves less margin for error, but it doesn't rely on any particularly hard rng. The nice thing is that you can level a level 1 pet this way as your weak pet won't take any damage.<br /><br />1) Start with your low level pet. Attack once, but it will get stunned and not attack (it will still get credit though). Swap in your next pet.<br /><br /><i>If you have a strong enough pet, you can leave it out for one more turn in order to soak the big hit the enemy does next, which will make the rest of the fight easier, but this is not necessary to win. The rest of this strat assumes you swapped after the initial stun.</i><br /><br />2) The trick pet for this part of the fight seems to be Squirrels of any sort. <br /><br /><i>As a critter, it takes reduced damage from the elemental's attacks and takes limited negative effects from the stuns. Basically, if you're slower than the enemy, when he stuns you, he spends one turn to stun you for one turn, and there's no net loss. If you're faster, you attack, he stuns you, and it wears off by next turn, meaning the enemy actually wastes a turn by stunning. I've been able to beat this trainer with several different critters due to this, but none were really super reliable until I found Squirrels.</i><br /><br />If you have the choice, you will want a Squirrel that's faster than 334 speed, out-speeding the enemy critter. I personally have found a standard <a href="/npc=61081/squirrel">Squirrel</a> with 341 speed. You need your Squirrel to have Woodchipper and Nut Barrage. If you're faster than 334 speed, use Crouch.<br /><br /><i>If you're slower than 334 speed, use Adrenaline rush. I'll explain the strat for a faster pet as it's more reliable. However, I want to make 2 notes about the slower Adrenaline Rush strat. You don't need Adrenaline Rush to be active immediately in the fight, but you do need Adrenaline Rush up before the enemy uses his abilities that can stun for the reasons mentioned above (occurs 3 turns after the first time he uses the large hitting ability). Second, make sure Adrenaline Rush is active when you kill the elemental. If you wait long enough on the first Adrenaline Rush, one Rush should cover both of these</i><br /><br />Turn 1) On the first turn, use Woodchipper.<br />Turn 2) On the second turn, use Crouch. Note that delaying the Crouch by one turn is on purpose; this causes the final turn of it to line up with the elemental's hard-hitting ability.<br />Turn 3+) Use a cycle of Nut Barrage when it's off cooldown; if not, Crouch; if not, Woodchipper.<br /><br />If you've done things correctly, Nut Barrage should have at least a few turns of its dot available, your critter should be alive with any amount of health (probably pretty low), and you should have first attack on the next turn.<br /><br />3) The enemy will now bring out his Critter. The goal here is you need to knock off roughly 1/3 of its health with your Squirrel, but the enemy critter's opening attack hits extremely hard. As long as you're faster than the enemy Critter, you should be able to Woodchipper (which is Beast vs. Critter), and then the damage of Woodchipper and Nut Barrage's dot will knock off a large portion of the enemy's health before it wears off. Your Squirrel dies.<br /><br />4) Swap in your Mechanical pet. <a href="/spell=103544/darkmoon-tonk">Darkmoon Tonk</a> is a common pet that will work (Missile/Minefield/Ion Cannon), but I found <a href="/spell=65682/warbot">Warbot</a> to be better (Missile/Minefield/Extra Plating). They both work under the same concept, but Warbot does a good bit more damage than the Tonk does and has access to Extra Plating.<br /><br />If using Warbot, use Extra Plating as often as possible. In either case, get Minefield down and then Missile the enemy Critter to death. Mechs take reduced damage from 2 out of the 3 of the Critter's attacks, so this shouldn't be too hard. The goal of this part of the fight is you need to kill the Critter with Minefield in place and without proccing your mech's survive-death ability.<br /><br />5) The enemy Beast comes out. If using the Tonk, immediately Ion Cannon. If using the Warbot, Missile the first turn, Extra Plating the second (if it's available), Missile the third.<br /><br />The way this places out is this. In either case, the Burrow will probably &quot;kill&quot; your mech, but you'll proc the survive-death ability. By the end of this turn, whether you used Ion Cannons or multiple missiles, the enemy Beast will be under 100 health. He'll Stone Rush, kill your Mech, but the damage he does to himself will kill the Beast as well. You'll still win because your level 1 pet is alive. Despite how close of a call this is, it's surprisingly repeatable.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jjanchan</b></h3><b>UPDATED for 5.3!</b><br />Here's a guide to beat this trainer with only 2 level 25 pets, allowing you to &quot;carry&quot; and power level a third!<br /><br /><b>Step 1:</b> You will need a rabbit pet with &gt;300 Speed at level 25. The best candidates are <i>just</i> over 300 speed, which is fast enough, while maximising the other stats. Certain breeds of rabbits will work best (Rare breeds 3, 11, 12). If hunting for the correct breed is not your thing, you can also use a <a href="/npc=32791/spring-rabbit">Spring Rabbit</a>, which will have enough speed even at uncommon rarity and is very easy to acquire. If, like me you are lucky enough to have <a href="/npc=59358/darkmoon-rabbit">Darkmoon Rabbit</a>, even better, as he is already rare!<br /><br /><b>Step 2:</b> You need a mechanical with Beast attacks to finish off Sludgy. I have found the <a href="/npc=68838/fluxfire-feline">Fluxfire Feline</a> works the best. I will write this guide using this pet, although it can be applied to other mechanicals - just be sure to select at least one strong Beast type ability. Easy to acquire alternatives include <a href="/npc=43916/de-weaponized-mechanical-companion">De-Weaponized Mechanical Companion</a> and <a href="/npc=15699/tranquil-mechanical-yeti">Tranquil Mechanical Yeti</a>.<br /><br /><b>Step 3</b>: Have your carried pet handy - place it in the first battle slot so it starts.<br /><br />Here is the setup you want to run:<br />Slot 1 - <br />Slot 2 - : <a href="/pet-ability=360/flurry">Flurry</a> | <a href="/pet-ability=312/dodge">Dodge</a> | <a href="/pet-ability=159/burrow">Burrow</a><br />Slot 3 - <a href="/npc=68838/fluxfire-feline">Fluxfire Feline</a> : <a href="/pet-ability=429/claw">Claw</a> | <a href="/pet-ability=923/flux">Flux</a> | <a href="/pet-ability=536/prowl">Prowl</a><br /><br /><i>Enemy Team Summary</i><br />Pandaren Earth Spirit : <a href="/pet-ability=569/crystal-prison">Crystal Prison</a> | <a href="/pet-ability=814/rupture">Rupture</a> | <a href="/pet-ability=801/stone-shot">Stone Shot</a><br />Sludgy : <a href="/pet-ability=448/creeping-ooze">Creeping Ooze</a> | <a href="/pet-ability=450/expunge">Expunge</a> | <a href="/pet-ability=445/ooze-touch">Ooze Touch</a><br />Darnak the Tunneler : <a href="/pet-ability=436/stoneskin">Stoneskin</a> | <a href="/pet-ability=159/burrow">Burrow</a> | <a href="/pet-ability=621/stone-rush">Stone Rush</a><br /><br /><b><u>Pandaren Earth Spirit</u></b><br /><br />Below is the ability order that this pet uses against you.<br />1. <a href="/pet-ability=569/crystal-prison">Crystal Prison</a><br />2. <a href="/pet-ability=814/rupture">Rupture</a><br />3. <a href="/pet-ability=801/stone-shot">Stone Shot</a><br />4. <a href="/pet-ability=801/stone-shot">Stone Shot</a><br />5. <a href="/pet-ability=801/stone-shot">Stone Shot</a><br />6. <a href="/pet-ability=801/stone-shot">Stone Shot</a><br />RESTART AT STEP 1<br /><br />As your rabbit is a critter, it takes reduced damage from Elemental attacks AND the Crystal Prison will really do nothing to the critter as CC is less effective against critters! You want to avoid <a href="/pet-ability=814/rupture">Rupture</a>, since it hurts. The way to do that is as follows.<br /><br />Use your carry pet to soak round 1 and 2*. Switch in your rabbit (round 3) and use <a href="/pet-ability=159/burrow">Burrow</a> for rounds 4-5 (You will avoid one <a href="/pet-ability=801/stone-shot">Stone Shot</a> and soak one the following round). Next use <a href="/pet-ability=360/flurry">Flurry</a> for two rounds (round 6 and then back to round 1), then use <a href="/pet-ability=312/dodge">Dodge</a> to avoid the <a href="/pet-ability=814/rupture">Rupture</a> in round 2 (and also the following <a href="/pet-ability=801/stone-shot">Stone Shot</a> on round 3!). Use <a href="/pet-ability=360/flurry">Flurry</a> for round 3, and then start again with <a href="/pet-ability=159/burrow">Burrow</a> on round 4-5 (as listed above), rinsing and repeating till the Earth Spirit is dead!<br /><br />*NOTE: The <a href="/pet-ability=814/rupture">Rupture</a> in Round 2 as listed above will deal about 500-550 damage to your carried pet, or about 350 if they are a critter (takes less damage from Elemental attacks). So, unless they are Mechanical (will resurrect after taking a killing blow) or Magic (can only take a maximum of 40% of it's health in a single hit) you will want to make sure your carried pet has enough health to withstand a hit!<br /><br /><u><b>Sludgy</b></u><br /><br />Mechanicals take less damage from 2 out of 3 of Sludgy's attacks, and when possessing a Beast type ability, can put out a lot of damage to get him down quick.<br /><br />When Sludgy comes out, switch to your mechanical - in this case <a href="/npc=68838/fluxfire-feline">Fluxfire Feline</a>. The strategy with the <a href="/npc=68838/fluxfire-feline">Fluxfire Feline</a> is very straightforward - <a href="/pet-ability=536/prowl">Prowl</a>, then <a href="/pet-ability=429/claw">Claw</a> till Sludgy is dead. It may well be that your mechanical dies or is very close to death by the time Sludgy goes down - that's ok.<br /><br /><u><b>Darnak the Tunneler</b></u><br /><br />Below is the ability order that this pet uses against you.<br />1. <a href="/pet-ability=436/stoneskin">Stoneskin</a><br />2. <a href="/pet-ability=159/burrow">Burrow</a> (Submerge)<br />3. <a href="/pet-ability=159/burrow">Burrow</a> (Emerges)<br />4. <a href="/pet-ability=621/stone-rush">Stone Rush</a><br />5. No ability (all abilities on CD)<br />6. <a href="/pet-ability=621/stone-rush">Stone Rush</a><br />RESTART AT STEP 1<br /><br />Time to bring your rabbit back in to work his magic! The precise setup of abilities selected for your rabbit means that it will take ZERO damage from Darnak. Here's how.<br /><br />Switch your rabbit back in as soon as Darnak comes out; he will do <a href="/pet-ability=436/stoneskin">Stoneskin</a> when you do so. Next use <a href="/pet-ability=360/flurry">Flurry</a> for one round, and when Darnak submerges, use <a href="/pet-ability=312/dodge">Dodge</a>, which avoids not only the <a href="/pet-ability=159/burrow">Burrow</a>, but also the following <a href="/pet-ability=621/stone-rush">Stone Rush</a> on round 4! Continue with <a href="/pet-ability=360/flurry">Flurry</a> for rounds 4 and 5 (round 5 is a free shot round, Darnak doesn't even do anything!) and finally <a href="/pet-ability=159/burrow">Burrow</a> for round 6, which avoids <a href="/pet-ability=621/stone-rush">Stone Rush</a>. Now rinse and repeat your way to a win!<br /><br />As one of the hardest trainers out there, this method will be a sure fire way to farm experience and bags day after day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>917356</b></h3>I confirmed that even if the only thing that your 1st pet is soak damage, it would get experience from these pet elemental battles.<br /><br />most common strategy would to use a pet that has defense against elemental like critters, i used a tolai hare pup (a rabbit), lots of damage avoidance, and a moth, most moth share the same move set, so it's quite common and viable strategy against these elemental pet battles.<br /><br />those two kind of pets are very common, and with a bit of patience and luck, you should have the rare ones, find the ones with high speeds, it will be very usefull.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>orcsmash</b></h3>The earth elemental will always open with a stun and get 2 free hits so your first pet must be a critter.<br /><br />I killed the earth spirit with a level 23 bandicoon, the rest is easy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shivacode</b></h3>Since none of the comments talk about this guy as a fighter, I'll do it and say this:<br /><br />Don't select this guy as the quest reward. Water Spirit is part of the Howl Bomb combo with Chrominius and Unborn Valk that can slaughter any Legendary PVE fight in the game. Pick that one. This guy is pretty lame except the stun and even then it's not great thanks to his craptastic speed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>KiritaWindwalker</b></h3>Original Combo Suggested by Vetis in a reply:<br /><br />First Pet: Carry/Plushie<br /><br />A Whelk (Or snail) <br />I use:<br />Absorb, Acidic Goo, Then Dive<br /><br />With a Tiny Harvester<br />Metal Fist, Extra Plating, and Demo<br /><br />Take the first two attacks with the Carry/ Plushie. I like the Plushie to Use In for a Hug on the 3rd round to avoid extra damage. Bring in Snail/Whelk.<br /><br />Start with keeping Goo up and then Dive. Fill with Absorb. Rinse Repeat till dead.<br /><br />He should of died a good ways into the Sludgey.<br /><br />Next bring out your Harvester.<br /><br />Keep Plating up and I personally like to just Metal Fist Sludgy down since its such a low hit chance.<br /><br />For last pet, you can choose to Spam Demo (till fist can kill) or just spam fist till its dead (which is what I do to take out the luck factor). Try to reapply plating during his burrow phases.<br /><br />This was the best 2 pet method i've found to work repeatably.<br /><br />Happy Hunting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Plaidiator</b></h3>I finally got one of these and was very sad to see that it no longer has its cool earth elemental feet that rotate around. That was one of the things that made me like the look of the pet the most. In one of the screenshots posted, it shows the feet and in another it does not. Did something change?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hunt3x</b></h3>What you need is:<br />1. Get two rabbit pets with more then 300 in speed.<br />2. Your third pet can be whatever you want.<br /><br />Fight and ability:<br />1. Ability for your rabbits &gt; Scratch + Dodge + Burrow.<br />2. Always start with Burrow &gt; dodge &gt; scratch when you attack. (if you start with burrow you let it cooldown, so you can use it 1 more time before it dies, helps alot)<br />3. Order is &gt; Burrow &gt; dodge &gt; Scratch and repeat.<br /><br />Result of fight:<br />By the time your 2nd rabbit dies, either boss dies or its around 10% in hp on 3rd pet<br /><br />My choice of pets:<br />Darkmoon Rabbit<br />Spring Rabbit<br />Darkmoon Zeppelin(doesn't matter what you choose here, but thats my set)<br /><br />Please upvote my comment!
