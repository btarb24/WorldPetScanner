<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>The rug which Dust Bunnies spawn from appear in more locations in Dalaran than just the barbershop. Apparently, in addition to the upper floor of the barbershop, there are also spawn locations for the rug in:<br />Magical Menagerie (the pet store)<br />Upstairs at The Legerdemain Lounge<br />Outside 'The Filthy Animal' (Horde-only)<br />Behind the Paladin portal at The Greymane Enclave (Alliance-only)<br /><br />I'll update if I find out about any others. <br /><br />I can also reliably say that, unless the spawn time has been considerably increased from beta (which is naturally very possible), there appears to only be one carpet up at a time in the city; I camped the barbershop for over an hour without luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wegie</b></h3>The rug spawned in the barbershop for me today at 4:44 p.m. PST, Lightbringer-US server. I parked my alts on different servers in the barbershop and went through them to peek into random shops for the rug. Then I logged on my main for the first time in 14 hours, and the rug is right there. There was plenty of time for me to go through the dust bunnies and get the breed that I wanted. I didn't come across any of rare quality, though, but I have a stone that can fix that.<br /><br />I should add that I spent an hour on launch night circling Dalaran on various toons in search of the rug, to no avail. The dust bunny is the pet I've been looking forward to getting in Legion and also the one that made me the most anxious. May you all find your own balls of gray fluff soon!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kalameda</b></h3>I've been checking intermittently since Legion went live to see the interactive rug in the barber shop to spawn these little guys, and today I was finally lucky enough to see it and click it immediately, obviously. <br /><br />Once this item is used, it seems like a set number of Dust Bunnies will spawn <i>all over Dalaran</i>. I counted about a dozen or so. The bunnies appear all at once, and since the timer seems to be yet unknown, best catch one while they're up and upgrade it if need be instead of cycling through every one available to find the perfect rare breed you want (unless you're on a very low-population realm), because other people may battle them, leaving none left for you!<br /><br />The model viewer and the screenshots really don't do this little guy justice. He's completely grey with black eyes and paws like a newspaper cartoon, and when he runs, a cloud of dust follows him everywhere he goes. Completely adorable.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>I found after clicking the item that instead of a set number, the bunnies just kept spawning.<br /><br />I had a 15 minute buff that let me 'see' the bunnies, and as long as I could kill them, I kept finding more popping up here and there. It wasn't until the buff ran out that the bunnies stopped showing up. <br /><br />For the record, my buff ran out in mid-battle with a bunny; the battle did not suddenly end. The game let me finish the pet battle. <br /><br />The dust bunnies that spawn after clicking the carpet, however, are *only* visible to the person who clicked it. No one else is able to see or interact with them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lemon031</b></h3>The combo of rug + dust bunny reminds me of a puzzle in <i>Beyond Zork</i>; I wonder if this is potentially a reference/callback to that.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rainec</b></h3><u><b>Alliance Tip:</b><br /></u><br />If you have a <b>point-based movement spell</b> like the Warrior leap, Demon Hunter tank hop, or maybe the Rogue chain, <b>you can get the rug even if it's on the Horde side.</b><br /><br />Go out to the flight landing area. There's a perfectly toppled pillar that forms a ramp right up to the wall that overlooks the exact spot the rug sits. If you use the movement spell right onto the rug, and click quickly enough, you will get the buff before being ported out if the server lag is in your favor. The buff applies instantly.<br /><br />Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pixiwix</b></h3>I've been checking for this rug several times a day in every known spawn point since Legion's launch. It finally spawned for me today at 5:30pm server time (if that matters to anyone). It spawned in the pet store behind the counter. The rug is blue with a gold/yellow outline/design and sparkles (you can't miss it, especially if you've been searching for it and know where rugs usually aren't).<br /><br />After clicking on it, I found 6 dust bunnies all around Dalaran within the 15 minute window. I managed to trap an uncommon (green) one but didn't find a rare (blue) one (of the 6 I found, 4 were poor quality and 2 were green). I also caught a grey (poor) bat as a secondary pet that I didn't previously have. Most of the other secondary pets were cockroaches or small frogs. <br /><br />I wouldn't go crazy searching for the rug, honestly; just check every time you're in Dalaran. It will save you huge amounts of sanity (speaking as someone who has an obsession with hunting down rare spawns). Good luck and just keep trying!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kamodius</b></h3>Just wanted to confirm that on live, as of 10/12/2016, the rug spawns <i>much</i> less frequently, and is a one-person only buff. A guildie of mine and I were camping it while grouped, found it on our Alliance characters and clicked simultaneously.<br /><br />I found it on the same character approximately 12 hours prior in the same place (the alliance area behind the Paladin portal).<br /><br />TL;DR - It's not like the Dalaran books, i.e. having a window for other people to click, and it has a much longer spawn time than 15 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Chereesa</b></h3>This may be pure coincidence, but i was just coming from picking up my burnt food and heading toward the transmog vendor when i saw a group of 5 enchanted brooms sweeping the street in front of the ally teleport room. <br /><br />this reminded me to go back there and check, and lo and behold, the carpet was spawned. did a couple battles til i got an s/s rare. <br /><br />went out afterwards looking for the brooms and they weren't to be found anywhere in the city. maybe they are tied to the rug spawn as an indication that its up somewhere in the city?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sheldorx</b></h3>Do yourself a favor after checking all sites on your own server without any joy then use server hop, save yourself the wasted time of going back and forth, server hop and chances are your gonna find it a lot quicker, mine spawned as a rare dust bunny and then 2 poor small frogs. Good luck finding your new pet!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>reedwand</b></h3>I was searching for this and was under the impression it would be the actual carpets already in the room but it is a spawned carpet, so if you go into Breanni's shop for instance, there are no rugs in there normally so you can literally do a fly by every time you are in Dalaran - easier than searching for books :)<br /><br />The dust bunny fights are lvl 25 Critter and the dusty one brings along 2 friends, which are random. <br />I battled as many as I could in the hopes of getting a rare, I didn't find one but remember you can buy a <a href="/item=98715/marked-flawless-battle-stone">Marked Flawless Battle-Stone</a> with <a href="/item=116415/shiny-pet-charm">Shiny Pet Charm</a> from <a href="/npc=98725/lio-the-lioness">Lio the Lioness</a> who is in your Garrison *shudder* as well as in Breanni's shop, in Dalaran. <br /><br />I am not sure which bread is the best, but with your timer you should have enough time to capture all 3 breeds. I went on the outside of Dalaran through the broken wall and I found none outside, nor any in the shops or inns, just on the streets of Dalaran itself.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lavandar</b></h3>Just to brag and laugh about this cute little guy ...<br /><br />I'd gotten the rug before but had no idea what it was for. I must have looked it up later and did a /facepalm. Then I forgot about it.<br /><br />Tonight, months later, he came to mind again, so I came here and read your comments. Then I went to where I'd found the rug before and ... it was there. :D<br /><br />I can make the 3 dust bunnies I got rares without a problem. Happy hunting. :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tulavelir</b></h3>In honor of my mother in law's house, they should make a Dust Buffalo.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Graysmith</b></h3>At the time of writing <b>this is the only rabbit in the game that's available in a P/S breed</b>, so definitely make sure to capture one or two of that breed when you can.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shalakazam</b></h3>I can confirm that a regular Joe like myself can click on the rug when it's horde side when utilizing enough patience. I thought from the comments I wouldn't be able to obtain it since I play a hunter and not a warrior or some such. However, I was determined to try. <br /><br />Remaining mounted, I climbed the broken tower at Krasus' landing, followed the ledge until I stood directly behind the dusty rug, and dive-bombed in. <br /><br />After several tries, I was able to click the rug and activate the buff before being rudely removed from the area! <br /><br />Hope this helps at least one of you who still haven't gotten it! Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TheGodofC0okies</b></h3>This is absolutely ridiculous honestly, only thing worse than this is the Time-Lost Proto Drake. All of this server hopping and waiting for a spawn (which we don't even know the timer for by the way) for a damn bunny. And it's on the Safari Achivement as well to make things even worse!<br /><br />These type of things aren't fun at all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nevarii</b></h3>Since it is a buff you get from the rug, it is possible to remove it. I just removed mine after getting 2 blue Dust Bunnies and one common. The Dust Bunnies in Dalaran disappear 2 seconds after it is removed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Habu64</b></h3>Trial characters work for this really well. Start a trial toon on an RP or low population server, and start farming. <br /><br />On a trial character, hearthstone to your capital city, then use the portal room to port to Legion Dalaran. Easy, peasy!<br /><br />Happy Hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Arms</b></h3>All Alliance frustrated that the only rug you can find is in the Horde teleportation zone - Fly well above it (not high enough that you die from fall damage) dismount mid-air and spam click on the rug. You will get the buff and teleport at the exact same time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>aprildawn567</b></h3>I found the dust rug behind the counter in Magical Menagerie /way 58.83, 38.56. The dust bunnies appeared immediately in Dalaran. This was at 6 a.m. EST on a Sunday, so I'm not sure if I just got lucky, or these were added back with the recent Shadowlands pre-expansion.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DeimosPhoboss</b></h3>Found the rug at 64.30 38.02 at 0100hrs which is the sewer grate cover next to horde inn. Not gonna lie, I feel I got really really lucky as I had just been on wowhead earlier reading how this would be difficult, all in all in took 90mins lol.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dreamgarden</b></h3>/way #627 52.6 30.0 Dusty Rug (Barber Shop)<br />/way #627 59.0 38.2 Dusty Rug (Magical Menagerie)<br />/way #627 31.0 72.9 Dusty Rug (Alliance-Greyfang Enclave)<br />/way #627 64.3 38.0 Dusty Rug (Horde-Filthy Animal)<br />/way #628 ? Dusty Rug (Underbelly-Legerdemain) - removed after beta?<br /><br />The rug spawned while I was standing on the spot in the barber shop (I thought that was pretty lucky), so I loaded up Grumpy ran out and happened to get a Rare on the first one I tried. Apparently that was the last item I needed for the Broken Isles Safarai, so I also got a Rescued Fawn. Awesome!<br /><br />So... I was wondering about the comments like &quot;he's so dusty&quot;. It's because he his model has a cloud of dust around him. His pet icon looks like a gray cloud with eyes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Moosplauze</b></h3>I have done Dalaran rounds looking for this rug a couple times on live servers with no success. When I just got to Dalaran on a new character that I chose Chromie Time Legion for, I walked into the Barber Shop and almost tripped over the colorful rug...not sure if I was incredibly lucky or if Chromie Time (also try wm on/off during chromie time) is the best bet to grab these. Good luck and any feedback appreciated, my character is on EU-Blackrock (High population).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Exephia</b></h3>Logged onto a low level alt, selected Chromie Timeline.<br /><br />Skipped the intro, checked the spots and instantly found a carpet. This was on a high pop server on EU.<br /><br />Definitely worth trying!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ArmyVet0409</b></h3>I did this today. If you can't find it try turning War Mode on/off depending on how you look for it the first time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bellie</b></h3>Did this yesterday - tried all of the advice but still had to come back here probably 10 times in a week. Think it is just a luck of the draw thing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>barneystrife</b></h3>The ABSOLUTE best times to get the rug is late evening and very early morning when no one is looking for it. Once that is attained, the rest is easy. Bob's your Uncle.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Enlivened</b></h3>I have been hunting this pet for a few years; now with multiple ports to Dalaran I have found the the rugs were only spawning in <b>Broken Isles Dalaran</b>. I wasted so much time in the wrong Dalaran. Don't be me. Once I realized my mistake, I was able to find the rug on multiple toons and got 2 rare quality and 1 green quality. Good Luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tommerbenry</b></h3>If you are using PetTracker addon, it will show where bunnies will appear AFTER you get the rug buff, NOT the locations of the rug</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ercarp</b></h3>The rug was on the Horde side for me but I was able to fly in fast enough (as an Alliance) and click it before the game ported me out.</div>
