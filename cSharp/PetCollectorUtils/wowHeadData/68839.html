<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ozlem</b></h3>One just spawned for me on the hill to the back of Everlook overlooking the town <br /><br />up until then I spent 2hrs fighting everything in the zone in hopes one would be a secondary pet and then 2hrs killing the non battle pets in Everlook.<br /><br />It was a poor quality pet but beggars can't be choosers with the new 5.1 pets so I'll take him and love him forever.<br /><br />EDIT: Yeah they spawn in town but I'm still seeing so many in random spots around 'Everlook', there is a goblin near a sign next to the road to Everlook, on the very edge of 'Everlook' named section of the map, and often I find a lone cub just sitting there chilling out next to that goblin when in town is heavily camped. So definitely keep checking the perimeter.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1059984</b></h3>Great tip for anyone farming any of the mechanical pets out there, non-combat critters spawn in the same spots, keep killing them off and you will get combat ones to spawn, found mine a ways outside the walls.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aletheua</b></h3>I just went and got one today to update my pet log, I didn't look for quality - but I see that poor seems to be the biggest grab for these little guys.<br /><br />They spawn around Everlook, usually with spiders and alpine chipmunks. They don't hit very hard, and are generally the first pet you battle. Hit them with another mechanical for assured small damage, so you don't kill it before you get a chance to catch it. Being mechanical in nature, if you DO kill it before you can throw a trap, they usually res themselves, giving you one more go at it.<br /><br />A beast pet on your team can take care of the chipmunks after.<br /><br />Kill all the other pets in the area while looking for this guy. I did not see him as a second or third spawn in any of the other packs; he will spawn in and around Everlook, he is not strictly an in-town spawner.<br /><br />Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>604233</b></h3>Within seconds of killing the non battle critters in the area they started spawning. I recommend killing all the critters you can around everlook.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>fademyken</b></h3>hey guys , so yeah im sort of perfectionist when it comes to little things like this and i only collect rares of all my pets, so i go around hunting until i get one of the type im looking for......<br /><br />DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I MADE... i camped everlook for a bit found 1 fought it captured it and it happened to be uncommon... not too long after another popped up fought it and since it was poor i forfeited... I then proceeded to release the uncommon and was left with zilch...<br /><br />I had no clue blizz had made the encounter rate so low on these pets and assumed they would be somewhat common ..... after about an hour killing critters around everlook i have found a common ... i am keeping this common. <br /><br />and when i get one of the pet items that can upgrade your pet to rare, i will do so. I suggest you do the same since it it kinda rare... to get a common haha.<br /><br />hope this helps</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>yezdk</b></h3>Found it outside Everlook after 5 minutes<br /><br />Quality: Rare<br />Level 16<br />Health: 1130<br />Attack: 185<br />Speed: 146</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Karthwyn</b></h3>Killing the robotic critters around and in winterspring boost drop rates on Robochicks, Nut varmints, and the Anodized Robo Cub fairly significantly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vexious</b></h3>Found mine around <b>59 52</b><br /><br />Took me about <b>3</b> times to kill all the pets in the area before this bad boy spawned.<br /><br />Confirmed it can spawn outside of Everlook <i>AND</i> inside.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aradona</b></h3>Found one right outside of Everlook on the SE side a bit, an uncommon. Oddly enough, two alliance players went into a pet battle, and it was still there afterwards, not sure if that was a bug or something. It was however the only one I found in the area. I'm pretty sure it won't show up as a secondary pet, but I haven't fully tested that theory.<br /><br />It also has a decent moveset, with 2 healing abilities, 1 Mech damaging ability and 2 Beast damaging abilities. Can definitely be a solid addition to a team.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nolapete</b></h3>I killed all the non combat pets in the area and found one spawn (poor) after about 10 minutes. Unfortunately, my pet killed it and when I returned after Alt-F4 someone else grabbed it. It's going to take a lot of patience to get this pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>859994</b></h3>I found one just east of Everlook. I did not kill critters (other folks may have been killing them in the area however), but flew around in circles around the town; being sure to check both inside the town and the surrounding hills. The one I captured actually spawned on top of a battle-able squirrel so that I almost missed him on my map.<br /><br />My advice is, if others are in the area, just keep circling. One is bound to pop up, and you can reach it faster since you're already mounted.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>769961</b></h3>Found one at 59,2 ; 45.6 <br /><br />So do not hesitate to look outside the town as well !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Starchy</b></h3>Went to Winterspring to level up some pets, so I stayed in the area around town for the stable master and killed whatever I saw outside the walls. After about 20 minutes, one of these guys spawned a little SW of the town, near the sign with Bronn Fitzwrench (58, 52). Spawn rates may be tied to other critters, but not sure. Good luck!<br /><br />Uncommon<br />Level: 17<br />Health: 1222<br />Attack: 163<br />Speed: 143<br /><br />Edit: A second one spawned near the flightpoint NE of town (61,49) as well. Try killing other critters to get these little guys to spawn (and other pets inside Winterspring)!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Selanda</b></h3>I found this today after about 30 minutes of trying to get it. Found it in Winterspring just north of Everlook. I killed all the non combat pets in and around the town.<br /><br />Me and a horde hunter both went into combat with it at the same time, and both got one. It was a rare quality pet.<br /><br />If your CRZ is super busy with people camping it, try getting a friend to invite you to their server, and hope it isn't crawling with people camping it like I did.<br /><br />GL!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SnappDiggity</b></h3>This is a solid battle pet and has become one of my favorite for 2 reasons. <br /><br />1. Supercharge + Demolish is very powerful. Even with the changes coming in 5.2 (reducing damage increase from 150% to 125%). You may miss a few times, but when you connect it's nearly always a one-shot. <br /><br />2. Having the both heals on the same tier. You don't have to choose between a heal and a damage ability.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>slumber</b></h3>i caught one (poor quality, but whatever!) a bit west of everlook. the coords were close by <i>58.08, 50.62</i>. i was hovering over the center of everlook and just killing the other battle pets that spawn there, but i couldn't see the robo cub until i went over to the stable master to repair, he was that far outside of the town.<br /><br />so if you're looking for this little guy, make sure you're not sticking to the walled-in area of everlook, as he seems to be able to spawn outside viewable distance on the minimap!<br /><br />(for those without coords, there is a small cluster of three trees on the west side of everlook where the road splits for the horde flightmaster and the stable master, as well as a path to the left. i saw the bear right around those three trees.)<br /><br /><b>also:</b> as i was typing this, i tabbed back into WoW and another one spawned, also far outside of town--right next to the road sign southwest of everlook (coords are <i>58, 52.46</i>). again, pretty far outside the walled area.<br /><br /><b>eta:</b> another at coords <i>60.72, 46.4</i>, kind of to the right of what i think is a GY (there are six stones in the ground atop what look like graves). so again, all the ones i'm seeing so far today (including a couple more other than the ones i have talked about in this comment) have all been outside the city. not sure if that's just RNG for me right now or if they are just more likely to not spawn within the walls of everlook. happy hunting (':</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1069318</b></h3>Found a common quality between two buildings. Now that I see its abilities it doesn't seem like the best mechanical battle pet. Its heal takes several rounds and its mechanical damage attack has a high chance to miss.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mccord</b></h3>Hi, in the comments on the Scourged Whelpling there is a post about tricking the CRZ mechanic. I tried it on the Robo Cub and it worked! If you see plenty of Cubs while inflight on a taxi but they vanish when you land try this: make a target macro ( /tar anodi) and bind &quot;interact with target&quot; to a hotkey. Then take a gryphon to Everlook (Hyjal works fine), hit your target macro inflight and when you have a Cub targeted spam the interact hotkey, if the gryphon is near the pet and in interact range it will take you right into the fight! Afterwards you'll likely be disconnected but keep the pet. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>776458</b></h3>I got to Everlook about 1/2hr before server reset in the morning. There was a Nelf hunter running around and killing every type of critter around, obviously looking for the Cub as well. I waited around until server reset and it did NOT help spawn these guys. I figured with all the critters being killed AND a server reset they'd be all over the place like the Spawn of Onyxia but no.<br />Managed to snag a poor Spawn of Onyxia, an uncommon Harpy Young and an uncommon Giraffe Calf just this morning so the wee AM hours are definitely the time to farm. Going to go back to check if the reset popped up any Minfernals and then off to Outlands to check for Flayer Young. (Mages are so handy).<br />Happy hunting all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tuctuc</b></h3>Found two of them on the hill east of everlook both were common quality, but the second one had another pet in the fight with rare quality bing a robo chicken. So I was mildly pleased.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mysticallyme</b></h3>I just spent about 40 mins circling the city and battling other pets, came back to everlook after reading a comment about checking buildings etc and there was one just to the right of the entrance. A common, but for now I am happy with it, They are cute :)<br /><br /> be patient they will appear.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AnarchParadigm</b></h3>Flew into the Everlook FP and saw a ton of them, but as soon as I landed, every battle pet in/around Everlook vanished (as if phased). I am currently Hated with Everlook (was farming Bloodsail rep working on the Insane achievement). <br /><br />Anyone else confirm that you have to be (at least) Neutral with Everlook in order for these to spawn?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Triffy</b></h3>I have had five of these spawn for me in less than an hour. 3 green and 2 grey. All I have done is run a circle around Everlook's walls killing mechanicals. This is not a hard farm at all. It is a CRZ and expect to be ninajed at least once. Whilst running around killing critters, there were more than a couple of the aforementioned hovering above the town itself.<br /><br />GL<br /><br /><s>I feel ill ! Wasn't looking for him, just came across him randomly. (blue version) Started the battle, and he was a fairly easy capture; problem was I had a very low lvl Lil Rag in my line up, as I have been trying to get him cheep xp. I lost the battle and the prize :(<br /><br />If you are going up there to capture this chap, make sure of your pets, that you haven't changed the spell selection on another toon etc. , because if you do find him you don't want to lose him.<br /><br />Good Luck !<br /><br />P.S. It was almost right outside the gates of Everlook</s></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Djehuty</b></h3>Got a common Anodized Robo Cub at (59.84, 45.81) at 1:37 am.<br /><br />Edit: Just got another one inside Everlook at coords (59.39, 50.27) at 1:43 am. This time it was an uncommon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>992790</b></h3>First one I found today was just outside Everlook and it was rare ! Talk about luck :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1034239</b></h3>I was on a flight path from Orgrimmar to Mount Hyjal to get my Nordrassil Wisp and as I flew over Everlook I see a bunch of pet icons on my map and I drag my mouse over them and I see all these Anodized Bear cubs! I freaked out because I couldn't dismount so first thing I did when I got dropped off at Hyjal was mount up and rush Everlook! I found one at uncommon quality (green) and I plan on using a battle stone to upgrade to rare quality!<br /><br />I found the Bear Cubs 10pm Pacific! Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>742619</b></h3>These are the only cub model that I've seen which open their mouths, the other cub models, including the raccoons, just shake their heads.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>719639</b></h3>Must be a luck thing, usually my luck sucks but I flew over Everlook doing the Lunar Festival thing and found an uncommon one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>picklelover83</b></h3>Used MyxomatosisFM's flight path method (posted on the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62317#comments:id=1800184">Minfernal</a> page) to capture my uncommon Anodized Robo Cub this morning. Took FP from Nordrassil, Mt. Hyjal to Winterspring. Spammed my <b>/tar Anodized R</b> macro and &quot;Interact with Target&quot; keybind. Worked on first flight, but targeted 3-4 different cubs before they were in range enough for the interact to work. <br /><br />Can confirm that this works on both the Minfernal and Robo Cub, as I got both of mine today this past hour. Just make sure you are taking a FP that is out of your own realm. Nordrassil to Winterspring seemed to work just fine, you will see many in the CRZ as you fly in but once you land you'll phase into your own realm. After the capture you will continue to be on the FP but will most like disconnect shortly after. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>764992</b></h3>Was farming rares in Winterspring for around 2 hours, including the ARC. Would see one or two each pass by Everlook. Then just after dailies reset on my server (3am PST) the ARC were everywhere, must have been 25 in and around Everlook. Got my rare on the 6th battle. Might be worth checking your server for the same circumstance, and would like to hear if anyone else sees this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>clark2005</b></h3>OK, so after reading all the comments I went out circling Everlook (inside and out) kill all the mechanical creatures I seen. After 2 hours only 2 <a href="/npc=62119/robo-chick">Robo-Chick</a> had spawned, so I stopped killing them and just waited. After about 10 minutes or so a <a href="/npc=68839/anodized-robo-cub">Anodized Robo Cub</a> spawned around 60,46. So, I don't know if killing the critters actually help or not, or if it's all just luck. Take what you will from this. :) Good luck!<br /><br />Oh and I ended up with a poor quality cub, which is fine with me. I will just use a <a href="/item=92680/flawless-mechanical-battle-stone">Flawless Mechanical Battle-Stone</a> to upgrade him. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>816171</b></h3>I've been killing all the robotic critters for 45 mins; did about 6 passes in and around everlook; only thing that keeps spawining is more non battle critters.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>816171</b></h3>Think i figured this out...i was just killing the robo critters. I think there is a threshold as to how many can be flagged as battle pets in an area.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Matthat15</b></h3>This battle pet is still pretty rare, but not even close to as hard to get as the <a href="/npc=62317/minfernal">Minfernal</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>skarpethinn</b></h3>i found mine at about 17:40 server time, just southwest of Everlook, literally right behind <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=16416">Bronn Fitzwrench</a>, who is standing on the corner where the road to Everlook branches off the main road (loc 58, 52) - one point of this post being that they spawn outside the town as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1101420</b></h3>I was at the Stable Master, Azzleby right outside Everlook healing my pets. I was about to fly away when I noticed the green paw pop up (58, 49) on my map and it was the anodized robo cub, poor quality but well worth it :) First one I've actually seen, ever. <br /><br />Just found another one as soon as I tabbed back into wow from writing this. <br />Poor Quality, found at (57, 48)<br /><br />Happy hunting!<br /><br />Update - 10 minutes after first post. <br /><br />Found Common Quality cub at (61, 53) <br /><br />2nd Update - A minute after previous post.<br /><br />Found Rare Quality cub at (59,48)<br /><br />So there was a total of 4 cubs I killed within let's say 15 minutes of each other. Poor quality (x2) - common - rare. <br />I was killing whatever other robotic pets spawned in between these kills. Out of the other robotic ones, I also caught the Robo-Chick - Rare Quality and Rabid nut varmint 5000 - Rare Quality.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>holdwine</b></h3>I like to use my Robocub against <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=68563">Kafi</a>, or really any beast I encounter while doing the Beasts of Legend or Pandaria Pet Trainer dailies. Supercharge followed by Demolish takes off a massive chunk of health and can even one-shot elite beasts like <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=67382">Fezwick</a> at the Darkmoon Faire. The 50% miss chance can really hurt, though, especially against the legendary beasts. If Demolish misses the first time, it's usually best to skip the Supercharge the next time, depending on how hard Kafi hits you. If by chance he misses, or doesn't headbutt, then feel free to try another combo strike. Needless to say there is no time to repair either. I haven't had as much luck with this pet against the Direhorn Runts in PvP battles, but then no one is having much luck against those beasts, currently.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>919061</b></h3>Kill the Battle Pets, not the critters!<br /><br />Today I tried the theory that killing the battle pets in the area would cause this and other mechanical battle pets to spawn. I circled around Everlook in ever widening circles, eventually going pretty far out killing Alpine Hares and Alpine Chipmunks . Every time I killed a few battle pets, I would head back and look for new spawns in Everlook. This worked! I was able to get one of the Anodized Robo-cubs to spawn within 15 minutes. I had to roam pretty far a couple of times and kill of the poor/common pets that did spawn.<br /><br />I hope this helps!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zatie</b></h3>If you're farming this to add to your collection - all the tips above will be great help.<br /><br />If you're farming this pet and thinking about leveling it as a mechanical type to help you battle...pass. His main, primary attack is actually a beast attack and the mechanical attack you can choose to replace it...has a 50% hit chance. It's third slot attack...is actually a beast attack. There is NO mechanical attack to replace it with. There is a mechanical spell, but all it does is up the damage of your next spell. If it's your only damaging mechanical spell (the one with a 50% hit chance) and it MISSES...you've now wasted TWO turns and you're probably dead.<br /><br />Wish someone would have written this before so I could have saved myself the time of getting this thing to 25.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1187388</b></h3>Three of this battle pet at level 25 (blue or not) seems to be one of the more effective ways to deal with Little Oondasta. In my experience the fact that they can pack quite a punch and also survive one extra turn with their mechanical ability makes them pretty good at kicking mini-dinosaur butt. An overcharge plus one or two Demolishes makes quick work of pretty much any Beast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Arrkhal</b></h3>Spawn rates must have changed for 5.4. I'm on a high population server (Moon Guard), and Everlook is always <i>packed</i> with Robo cubs every time I pass through on my way to battle Trixxy.<br /><br />I killed about 8-10 while hunting for a rare H/P and leveling some lowbie pets, just circled, and there are still 10 of them left. Either spawn rates are very high now (on this server), or a lot of people are experiencing phasing issues.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bibliomnomnom</b></h3>I have been playing for three hours just outside Everlook and have found a bunch of these guys. Mostly poor quality, but I've found three rare quality ones as well. It's Midsummer right now, and I found the rare ones next to the Alliance fires.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>QuartrDollarKing</b></h3>They must have nerfed the spawn rate for these guys into the ground sometime in WOD. Finally see one after days of checking to complete my mech pet collection and I get beaten to the punch buy a guy who kills it to catch a SPIDER!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jweegens</b></h3>Found one right inside the town at 59, 50.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1483721</b></h3>This was my first mechanical pet, and I've used it in hundreds of pet battles. I'm not sure if I just have really bad luck, but I've found that the success rate of the Demolish skill is way below 50%. For me, it's been closer to 15-20%, and I'm saying this after using it as my main mech pet against beasts all the way up to the Pandaria fabled beasts dailies.<br /><br />It may not be the case for everyone, but if you want a reliable mechanical pet against beasts, I'd recommend using a different one.<br /><br />If you are using it against a beast, I'd advise against using Supercharge, because it only increases damage by 25% for the very next attack. You're better off using both rounds to try and land a hit with Demolish.<br /><br />In addition, I've noticed that you can tell when the pet is going to land an attack with Demolish. If it runs straight up to the other pet, the attack will succeed. If it runs to the side of the pet it's attacking, it's going to miss.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>louks03</b></h3>Seems like this battle pet is much more common than it used to be. I find it up in Everlook like all the time. I have only seen it poor so far.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mjedzi1028</b></h3>I would absolutely love this as one of the mechanical pets for hunter!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gamecrazed</b></h3>as far as i know, as of Patch 7.3.5 the spawn rate of ANY combat Variations is abysmally low. ive been camping Everlook for 2 hours, killing any non-Combat variations of Robo Chicks, Nut varmint 5000's, and Rabbots's and ive only had 1 combat variation spawn and haven't even seen any Anodized Robo Cub's.</div>
