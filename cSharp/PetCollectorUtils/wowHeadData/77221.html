Around 222 base damage in one hit (or 167 vs. an Elite). Whether or not it's the most efficient way to win, it would at least be entertaining.</div>

Throw in a howl and we might just have ourselves the heaviest hitting single attack yet.<br /><br />Tested on a crunchy scorpion without crouch, using the P/P breed level 25 Starlette, an Alpine Foxling at really low health and a Mr. Wiggles at really low health. I used Wind-Up, swapped to my piggie, spammed Uncanny Luck until it died. The Foxling required 2 hits to kill it, so I used Dazzling Dance and Howl. It died directly after, so I had 3 turns of Uncanny Luck and 2 turns of Howl. My Starlet was all that was left now, ready for the real test. Wind-Up was still active so I used Supercharge and Wind-Up again. The result was a staggering 8595 crit.</div>

I have one each of the 152 12/11 and 14/10 pets. <br /><br />Just curious if anyone else is seeing this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kliamovich</b></h3>I have yet to see this pet as Breed #6 H/H<br /><br />Edit: Found one today on the AH going for 10k, seems to be a very rare breed</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aliandrin</b></h3>You want the tanky breed that grows up to have 1725 health. These are currently selling for 5k gold on Illidan (a high-populated server) and will only rise as they become unavailable. If you got the 11/10 breed, do not sell it short (or at all imo), because you just hit the jackpot.<br /><br />First, the Wind Up + Supercharge + Wind Up is going to be instakill regardless. You don't need the 341 attack. Even Explosion will hit for more, since it deals damage based on health. 1725 is enough health to survive three hits from almost any pokemon currently in the game. With this combo (unless the opponent can evade) you do that, and you win.<br /><br />Secondly, and a minor point, the steel-type resurrection goes on a percentage of your health. You want high health so you don't get one-shot afterwards, gleaning two free turns instead of one. Unless you're killed quickly, you just got another Wind Up off.<br /><br />I'm showcasing the proper min-max of this incredibly overpowered pet in hopes that he makes his way into the meta. If he does, magic-types may become viable due to their anti-one-shot racial.</div>

So don't get scammed by stupid rumours.<br /><br />I personally love this pet, but I have to admit that most people here are exaggerating how good this pet really is. If you know how to play, you'll find out many ways to easily counter this pet.</div>
