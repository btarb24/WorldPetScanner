No spawn for 2 hours and checking back and forth nothing spawned up to the north east either.  I checked every rat battle pet that spawn with no libram in the group.  So I decided to just allow my 2 toons to idle there above these two locations casually checking around every few mins. At exactly 3 p.m. server time on Whisperwind (which is central time) A libram spawned.  I flew down and it was a blue yay!  So my 2nd account had been a toon base off of Senjin realm. I would join group to have it come to whisperwind and camp and had casually left group to check Senjin as well.  When I found my Libram on my whisperwind account I left group to check Senjin and sure enough there were Librams up there as well.  \r\n\r\nNo method of killing anything helped me. It seems more logical that they are just on a spawn timer.  \r\n\r\n6\/12 - Wednesday","date":"2013-06-12T15:12:22-05:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":56,"id":1867678,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"1071324","body":"Ok so after going for the Take 'Em All On ([achievement=6851 domain=www]) I just needed to fight a magic creature i first tried for the Jade Oozeling but didn't have any luck.

I did NOT check here first, because it looked like lots of spawn points around the crater. And there were 2 LLs up (both poor), so I went through the normal steps: circle around, scan, battle the rats in the hope of a sec spawn on a LL. Over an hour like this, and I pulled a few other rares - Snowshoe, a spider, etc.\r\n\r\nGave up, did other stuff, and came back later on in the in-game 'day'. Only 1 LL was up, but it was an Uncommon, so I grabbed it, but kept looking for a Rare LL. \r\n\r\nSame routine - I killed the 'rare' dragon a handful of times, picked up a rare rat upgrade and a couple more secondaries. Then came here, and tried the strats mentioned in the top-rated posts.\r\n\r\nNo luck in getting LLs to spawn. Got bored with it, and on to other stuff. Food, sleep, etc.\r\n\r\nChecked back in (this) morn, and only  a couple of rats. Meh - logged out.\r\n\r\nDid work over my IRL day today, and logged in game around 3:30am server time. To find roughly 6 LLs up, and a couple of rats (plus 1 infected deer) - pet battles all over the crater! I battled all of them I saw (another 2 Uncommon LLs, but no rare), and as they respawned, it was more LLs than rats . . . \r\n\r\nUNTIL 5am SERVER TIME. \r\n\r\nIn the hours since then, I have only seen 1 LL spawn, and that is battling the rats, killing the critters, etc. A HUGE difference from before 5am.\r\n\r\nHere is what 2 days have taught me:\r\n\r\n* I NEVER SAW IT SHOW UP AS A SECONDARY, in 2 days, 4 sessions of active battling\/farming. \r\n\r\n* no spawns in the crater. The closest I have seen is 1 right in front of the rare dragon spawn Indigos (saw it spawn there twice).\r\n\r\n* they will spawn inside the bubble edge, on the circles, in the ruins, and a couple at the edges of the woods. 2 spawned at the far north, right over by the water edge, close to Archmage Cedric. The 2 places I saw them most were at the larger ruins at the NE and SSW (near the statue & gallows). \r\n\r\n* you will see a couple of spawns for blighted squirrels, but these are actually in Silverpine\/the neighboring zone (lvl 3) - so I just ignored those.\r\n\r\nIf you battle enough rats, you will eventually get most of the other zone-available rares, except  Huge toad, infected fawn, and the infected cub.\r\n\r\n* If I had to start this process over again, I would have done it on a horde, as you can keep yourself busy killing everything around the crater in the (insanely low) hopes of the Black Tabby Cat Carrier zone drop. Alliance can kill the Arcane Remnants, but if you are horde, you can also clear out all the Dalaran mages, workers.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps - if anyone can try\/confirm the 'before 5am server time' increased spawns - EITHER WAY, YEA OR NAY - and comment after, I'd appreciate it!\r\n\r\nHappy hunting!\r\n\r\n~Darquenezz of Cenarion Circle~","date":"2013-07-28T09:27:16-05:00","rating":6,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Day 3 of the Rare hunt: I have had a working day today, so just logged in 5:30am server time.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Alliekatt</b></h3>Galakrond did NOT spawn any at the server restarts today. However, all the rats and capturable rats that i had killed.. did respawn LOL <br /><br />I just wanted to clarify that I was specifically waiting to see if this would &quot;cause&quot; the Lofty Libram to magically appear, as some have claimed and speculated. I was farming and killing up to the point of being disconnected. Logged back in and waiting for the server to come back online. No dice. So for this little guy, at least on Galakrond, server resets are not the magic ticket. <br /><br />On my horde realm i've tried killing all the summoners, workers, arcane remnants, critters and battle rats.. anything that wiggled was not safe. No books lol <br /><br />Since Alliance cannot kill the summoners and workers - i'm pretty confident that this would not play into the rng drop pool.<br /><br />I will continue to slay critters and battle pets, and upon my word vow to be satisfied with even a poor quality! lol<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jeolene</b></h3>So, my first thought was &quot;where would something like this spawn in this zone? Dalaran crater, of course!&quot; Was bummed that I didn't find any when I got there, so I decided to go start a ratpocolypse with a nice target macro of:<br /><br />/tar rat<br />/startattack<br /><br />The rats have a fairly quick respawn timer and in the half hour of doing this, I got 3 books to spawn, along with about 4 other battle rats. Of the few battle rats that I engaged, the book was not a second add, so I'm going to assume this won't happen.<br /><br />I have also noticed that with the few books I battled, they seem to take quite a few more hits to take down. While the rats and rabbits (and one time a toad) can be done in by 1-2 hits from my lvl 25 pets, the book take about 2-3 times that many hits just to get it to 'capture' health. The books also seem to only spawn where the rats did, being the old burned out buildings, I have not seen anything spawn in the crater or anywhere there aren't buildings. I did only find a poor, which I'm good enough with, maybe come back later one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Feathers</b></h3>Flew in to see a couple of derps flying around the crater aimlessly, one guy said he'd been there for an hour. Place was chock full of rats. Killed them all and a libram spawned within 3 minutes... sure enough, it was a rare. Moral of the story: Check wowhead first.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Coriam</b></h3>For what it's worth, my first sighting of one of these nifty pets was within the bounds of the dome, on the little hill leading to Indigos (31.8,40.1). I didn't see any down within the crater's scar, however.<br /><br />Edit: Also, two other Librams outside the dome, half a dozen battleable rats and easily twice that in just basic-critter rats running around at the same time. Rats and Librams are not mutually exclusive.<br /><br />Further edit: Why downrate? Just because you killed a rat and a libram spawned doesn't make the events related.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kolbruns</b></h3>So to sum up all the random comments, and from my experience, DON'T just kill the rats, BATTLE THEM. The Libram could be a secondary, or you may get a Snowshoe Hare, which is almost as big a PITA! to farm as the Libram. 30 mins of farming and got two Librams to spawn, common and poor, both at the Southern-most area of the crater. Good luck to all.<br /><br />edit: while not having seen a Libram spawn as a secondary firsthand, there have been posts claiming that one was obtained that way. No way of knowing if the ppl are mistaken/pulling our leg, or if it's a really poor chance of it as secondary.(##RESPBREAK##)2572##DELIM##MasterOfDisguise##DELIM##</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>alpanhell</b></h3>I went to Dalaran crater today and saw about 5 libram's and a few other critter battle pets. I battled them all looking for a rare libram and didnt' get one. I then waited around for a half hour and saw several critter pets respawn (which I checked for libram secondary and didn't see any) no libram's.<br /><br />During this entire time there was no one else there, it was just me.<br /><br />This tells me that the libram's do not share a respawn timer. What I plan on doing is just visiting here every once in awhile as I don't have the patience (or inclination) to sit here for hours like some do. If I see libram's I'll check them out for rares and then come back later once I've checked them all.</div>

You can change the item name after the &quot;/Tar&quot; if you want to change it to target other pets that you are hunting as well. You can also add other targets to the list. I have left a few others on this as well as an example. <br /><br />If you are new at macros, hit escape in the game, select macros and create a new macro. You can select any of the icons for it. Copy and paste the section below in the body of the macro. Save it and put the icon in your action bar and click as you walk or fly around. It will mark your target with an &quot;X&quot; over it's head.<br /><br />Happy Hunting!<br /><br />/tar Lofty Libram<br />/tar Stunted Yw<br />/tar Sumprush R<br />/stopmacro <br />/run SetRaidT</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1065858</b></h3>I will say that there has been a lot of debate about killing trash critters. I tested it with the Lofty Libram. <br /><br />Left it alone and stood there for a few hours, got ONE spawn. I didn't see anyone move around me and I stayed in the area with a &quot;higher spawn rate.&quot;<br /><br />I then went around /targeting things and killing the trash critters. Got 2 librams (both crap but I still grabbed one) in about 30 minutes. Not great but it proved it well enough for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>52390</b></h3>Levelling this guy is easy. I've confirmed that the Arcane Explosion tags the entire enemy team for xp. So, go to some high level battles; libram opens the battle with an explosion, and then swaps out. Levels fast, low to no risk of the libram dying. Once levelled combines well with Sprite Darter Hatchling (Evanescence to absorb special attack, Moonfire to buff magic damage, then use Libram).<br /><br />I named mine &quot;Necrogoblicon.&quot; Because gnomes are the inferior (albeit adorable) race.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zarrise</b></h3>I had my doubts, but ttanker1's strategy worked perfectly. Two Lofty Librams popped up after I killed rats...took about 30 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1084235</b></h3>First post is wrong. You can indeed force the libram to spawn by killing the critters in the area. I tried his method first and after 2 hours of no success attempted the second method and spawned 2 in about 45 mins. Please downgrade the first comment to avoid further confusion. Good luck catching your own libram.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JoyousOblivion</b></h3>I'm not sure how these guys spawn, but last night I was in the area and wanted to catch one. i wish I had of known they were hard to find as I gave up trying to find a rare after about 30 minutes.

This occurred after 4 nights of camping for about 2-3 hours at a time. <br /><br />At the risk of sounding like a broken record, DEFINITELY kill the non combat low level critters to help spawn rate, and DEFINITELY check every battle pet that pops.This guy was a secondary to a grey rat.<br /><br />Good luck! :)</div>

Arm yourself!&quot;<br />~The Doctor, Doctor Who<br /><br />So you want to arm yourself? These battle pets are found around the Dalaran Crater. They are still hard to come by, as most of the pets I see here are Rats; but don't just kill them! The Librams CAN be secondary pets that join the battle... that's how I got my first one (though it was poor quality).<br /><br />Cross Realm Zones doesn't help either, since I've seen 3 other lvl 90s from various realms up here looking for these and Snowshoe Hares... So in an hour I've only seen two Librams (and I don't know how many I've missed because of the other players). My best one is Uncommon, but one day when I have more time maybe I'll find a rare.<br /><br />But keep trying! You'll get one. =)<br /><br />Edit: right after I posted this, I came across two librams and a snowshoe hare back to back. So, guess it's also just up to RNG and if it feels like being nice. Still no rare librams though. =/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Queenofdruids</b></h3>To get the book to spawn, you need to battle ALL of the critters around the area. If there are no more critters just fly around and maybe a book will spawn. And if more critters spawn, battle all of them. Took me about a day of battling pets to get it. When I logged on around the night time, I flew near all of the houses on the right side of the giant hole, and there tons of them! Good luck and I hope this helps. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Calathia</b></h3>I had been farming for this companion for about 4 hours. I tried various methods posted by others. First method I tried was killing all the rats. Tried this for about an hour with no luck. Not a single spawn and I was the only one in the area. I decided to get onto a second account and have it camp one area (top right) while I played the other account at the south point. I then tried the advice of another comment saying to stay in one spot and kill the 4 various rats that spawn there and that it was a &quot;fail proof&quot; way of getting it.. No spawn for 2 hours and checking back and forth nothing spawned up to the north east either. I checked every rat battle pet that spawn with no libram in the group. So I decided to just allow my 2 toons to idle there above these two locations casually checking around every few mins. At exactly 3 p.m. server time on Whisperwind (which is central time) A libram spawned. I flew down and it was a blue yay! So my 2nd account had been a toon base off of Senjin realm. I would join group to have it come to whisperwind and camp and had casually left group to check Senjin as well. When I found my Libram on my whisperwind account I left group to check Senjin and sure enough there were Librams up there as well. <br /><br />No method of killing anything helped me. It seems more logical that they are just on a spawn timer. <br /><br />6/12 - Wednesday</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gajackson</b></h3>As a follow-up to my Tiny Twister post, July 2013:<br /><br />When I came to the Dal crater yesterday, it was just about 6:30 am server time. I did NOT check here first, because it looked like lots of spawn points around the crater. And there were 2 LLs up (both poor), so I went through the normal steps: circle around, scan, battle the rats in the hope of a sec spawn on a LL. Over an hour like this, and I pulled a few other rares - Snowshoe, a spider, etc.<br /><br />Gave up, did other stuff, and came back later on in the in-game 'day'. Only 1 LL was up, but it was an Uncommon, so I grabbed it, but kept looking for a Rare LL. <br /><br />Same routine - I killed the 'rare' dragon a handful of times, picked up a rare rat upgrade and a couple more secondaries. Then came here, and tried the strats mentioned in the top-rated posts.<br /><br />No luck in getting LLs to spawn. Got bored with it, and on to other stuff. Food, sleep, etc.<br /><br />Checked back in (this) morn, and only a couple of rats. Meh - logged out.<br /><br />Did work over my IRL day today, and logged in game around 3:30am server time. To find roughly 6 LLs up, and a couple of rats (plus 1 infected deer) - pet battles all over the crater! I battled all of them I saw (another 2 Uncommon LLs, but no rare), and as they respawned, it was more LLs than rats . . . <br /><br />UNTIL 5am SERVER TIME. <br /><br />In the hours since then, I have only seen 1 LL spawn, and that is battling the rats, killing the critters, etc. A HUGE difference from before 5am.<br /><br />Here is what 2 days have taught me:<br /><br />* I NEVER SAW IT SHOW UP AS A SECONDARY, in 2 days, 4 sessions of active battling/farming. <br /><br />* no spawns in the crater. The closest I have seen is 1 right in front of the rare dragon spawn Indigos (saw it spawn there twice).<br /><br />* they will spawn inside the bubble edge, on the circles, in the ruins, and a couple at the edges of the woods. 2 spawned at the far north, right over by the water edge, close to Archmage Cedric. The 2 places I saw them most were at the larger ruins at the NE and SSW (near the statue &amp; gallows). <br /><br />* you will see a couple of spawns for blighted squirrels, but these are actually in Silverpine/the neighboring zone (lvl 3) - so I just ignored those.<br /><br />If you battle enough rats, you will eventually get most of the other zone-available rares, except Huge toad, infected fawn, and the infected cub.<br /><br />* If I had to start this process over again, I would have done it on a horde, as you can keep yourself busy killing everything around the crater in the (insanely low) hopes of the Black Tabby Cat Carrier zone drop. Alliance can kill the Arcane Remnants, but if you are horde, you can also clear out all the Dalaran mages, workers.<br /><br />I hope this helps - if anyone can try/confirm the 'before 5am server time' increased spawns - EITHER WAY, YEA OR NAY - and comment after, I'd appreciate it!<br /><br />Happy hunting!<br /><br />~Darquenezz of Cenarion Circle~</div>

I'd all but given up trying when I found the elusive rare! I captured him then went up to the next Lofty Libram to try my one out and I kid you not it was another rare! I caught him also but after all the hours of trying I couldn't really believe it. When I logged back in later I battled a few rats and just for the poops and giggles of it I clicked on a couple of Lofty Librams......the second one was another rare but I forfeited and left him for the next lucky player to come along.

All the stuff about killing all the rats in the area and killing everything around the crater to get it to spawn is mostly RNG playing tricks with you. It just comes down to luck, as with most rare items/pets/mounts in this game.<br /><br />Keep at it, and it will come when you least expect it :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Callmerabies</b></h3>I read the first comment and assumed I would be farming rats for 20 minute before i found a libram.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Askania</b></h3><b>After following a combination of Kolbruns theory and ttanker1 here is what worked for me.</b><br /><br />Any battle pets you see, unless there is an upgrade or missing pet, forfeit the fight and kill them, this will cut down the time you wait for the Libram's to spawn. Lofty's are <u>NOT</u> a secondary spawn. After 3 hours of killing everything, I got 5 spawns including one on a ledge in the crater. One of these 5 was in fact a rare. All spawned from 31.2 31.8 (which when you go there it is the north western part of the crater as shown on the mini map) in a straight line heading south from that point. The 5 spawned individually to each other rather than all at once, and none spawned at all in the eastern side of the crater.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1062417</b></h3>Just got him!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Heimdallen</b></h3>I decided to wander over to the Dalaran Crater after killing the Greench to see if a Lofty Libram was up, and to my surprise I found no less than a dozen of them up! Many times I've gone by there and not one has been up, and killing rats and snakes and squirrels for a while yielded no Libram respawns, so I was kind of dumbfounded. <br /><br />Apparently it's worth randomly checking because this might happen to you, too! I easily bagged a rare on my third try, saving myself a flawless upgrade stone. <br /><br />They were up all throughout the ruined buildings, some relatively far from the pink line on the crater, and there were also a few well inside the pink ring on rocky outcrops inside the crater. So they don't just spawn in a tight pattern on the very edge of the crater, it's all of the ruins there. <br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>magicpetsarebest</b></h3>Battle and KILL rats for it to respawn. Their spawn time must have been reduced or it just depends on how many (if any) are farming it on your server. I caught 3 and killed 1 within the hour. I was the only player around though.<br /><br /> EDIT: I guess I just cleared them all, because only Rats are spawning now lol guess I'll try for a rare one some other time!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>celexis17</b></h3>I did about an hour and a half to two hours of farming and ran into about 20 rats I had to beat in battles or kill in order to get just ONE Libram to spawn. It spawned in the northeastern corner just after the houses. Just be prepared to sit for a while. Not sure which is worse, farming this or the Black Tabby....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>silveropal3</b></h3>After about two hours of flying around the Dalaran Crater edge, killing all the rats and battling the battle-able rats I was going to fly to Silverpine Forest to go and capture a pet there.<br /><br />I decided to make one more round around the crater.......AND THERE IT WAS!<br /><br />One Lofty Libram @ 28, 43. Uncommon quality. It was the only one I got to spawn (if I even did get it to spawn).<br /><br />I never got a Lofty Libram as a secondary and I battled every pet I saw, I didn't forfeit any battles.<br /><br />At one point I started killing the humanoids that were around the crater, but only on one time around the crater.<br /><br />This happened at 5:20AM CST.<br /><br />EDIT<br />Scratch that. I wrote this comment and then decided to take yet another last round about the crater and I found another Libram @ around 32, 42, this one poor quality. Fought it and captured it.<br /><br />Feeling my luck had changed I flew around again and there was another Libram around the same spot, Common quality. Fought this one and captured it, too!<br /><br />This happened between 5:25AM and 5:30AM CST.<br /><br />EDITx2!<br />@ 27, 39 I found another Libram around 5:53 CST, poor quality.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>schnizol</b></h3>I saw only one... it was a poor quality pet, but I caught just for the looks of it.</div>

I'm talking everywhere, I could find only 1-2 rats. Earlier I looked for this pet for hours and hours on end and found 0. There has to be a pattern here, anyone knows? Time of day? Day of week?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Slunko</b></h3><u><b>LISTEN UP</b> and save yourself a headache.</u><br /><br />Info about the Libram from the 7.0.3 patch and how to get it:<br /><br />After days spent and many hours farming rats I can tell you that you are wasting your time. <br /><b>Here's what I've found out:</b> <br /><ul><li>Lofty Libram doesn't come as a 2nd tag pet to a rat. Killing rats for days did nothing to help spawn Librams either, nor was killing critters. </li></ul><br /><ul><li>The rare spawn doesn't seem to play a role in any of this. </li></ul><br /><ul><li>I was tryin the methods suggested here with no luck so I decided to <u><b>leave a character in the crater area and log him in for a quick lookaround every once in a while.</b></u> It worked. </li></ul><br /><br />On saturday morning (9:00 server time) the area was FULL of Lofty Librams flying around, respawning faster than I could kill them. Even then, they NEVER came as a 2nd pet to a rat, so don't waste your time with rats, but rather wait, log in and look around the area if the Lofty Librams are spawning, if not, move on. <br />After 30mins or so of killing them they just stopped respawning, so It's safe to say they are on some sort of a <b>timer</b>.<br /><br /><b>TL;DR:</b> <u>7.0.3 info;</u> They spawn on their own, on a timer, NEVER 2ndary to rats. Don't waste time on rats, <u><b>leave your character in the area, log in at different times and fly around to see if librams are spawning or not.</b></u> I got mine on a saturday morning.<br /><br />Happy hunting and vote up, so others can see this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gamerunknown</b></h3>For those having trouble with this: I'd highly recommend trying a bunch of different servers if you have high enough alts to travel around, rather than waiting to force a spawn. Spent about 3 hours trying to get a spawn, then just hopped alts for 20 minutes and found 2 there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TamlinFTW</b></h3>I was grinding the crater for a couple of hours total over the past couple of week, with absolutely zero results.<br /><br />Then today I was on my way past there doing some archaeology and decided to check in and see if there were any librams, and suddenly the place was FULL of them!<br /><br />I captured two uncommon and one poor and killed a couple more before finding a rare. And there are still at least ten more Lofty Librams in the area that I haven't even checked yet!<br /><br />Is this just some amazing fluke? Did I manage to hit a server reset or something? Or does this indicate that there are certain times at which the spawn rate goes way up?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Loki421</b></h3>1. Spawns in the mornings around 6:00-10:00 AM server time, peaking at 8:00 AM. (not every morning)<br />2. Tons of them spawn, should be easy to get.<br />3. Got mine at 8:10 AM Thursday, there were about 20+ there.<br />4. Killing rats does <u>not</u> appear to trigger spawns.<br />5. Can spawn at other times of day, but most people report mornings. <br /><br />Note: This is based on what I experienced and what others have reported. I've checked back a few different mornings and every time there is a bunch there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SlayferSan</b></h3>*First of all I am still to catch him, farming at the moment*<br />Been farming for 3 days now<br /><br />1. Did not see him yet as a secondary pet and I've killed hundreds in battle<br />2. If you do not battle any of the pat and go to the different area they will change after 5-10 min; example: Squirrels can become Rats, passive Rats can become active and so on. (Area reset I guess, well checked)<br />3. Number of active battle Rats vary from 2 to 10 <br />4. Killing all the critters in the area gives a little help as far as I could see. Since they are changing on their own killing all of them is pointless.<br /><br />I've got all rares including, Rat, Spider, Maggot, Toad, Huge Toad, Squirrel, Chicken, even Snowhoe Hare as a secondary pet. I've battled every active pet for more number of wins, using Dream Whelpling from Emerald Nightmare, since it has shield spell and they can not damage him since they are way too low level. <br />I advise to just battle all active pets, than goo fly around for some time, I was fishing or mining and than get back and battle again and look for Lofty or hope you get him as secondary which I really don't know if it's possible. Will update as soon as I get Lofty Libram!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>pfeff</b></h3>Its been said before, but I want to reiterate. If you don't see any at a current time at dalaran crater, don't waste your time farming waiting for them to spawn. They seem to spawn at different times of the day, particularly the morning. I farmed for like 3 hours with none in sight. I got back on around 7 am cst(6 est or 9 pst) and found 4 or 5 roaming around.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ojjo</b></h3>When it rains, it pours.<br /><br />For three days I farmed for this on and off. Generally I was there for an hour or more at each session. Went as long as four hours once. I tried a few methods at first. I circled the entire crater killing everything with no success at forcing a spawn. Then I tried killing just critters and battling eligible Rats; also with no spawns and never a secondary pet Libram to fight. I tried camping in one spot at several different spots with the same results. Last, I tried just doing battles and leaving the critters alone. This dramatically improved battle pet spawn rate, but still no Librams. I logged out, and watched a flick. As it happens &quot;Magical Beasts and Where to Find Them.&quot; I paused the film about 30 minutes in and logged in to check once more.<br /><br />Well .....<br /><br />Not only did I find a Libram, I captured the poor quality thing. Then I saw another and quickly captured it as well. Then i saw another, and another and moving a bit; another. Not only did I end up up getting what I came for, I nabbed three rare Lofty Librams (letting go of two poors and one uncommon). I found no less than 12 spawned at once. I don't know if this is typical, part of a glitch with the new patch, or the magic of Hogwart's; but I'll take it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>qwerty31</b></h3>Read all the comments talking about mornings, so the first time I checked for this pet was at 8:45am server time. I found 15 or so all flying around Dalaran crater.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bomigabster</b></h3>I didn't know that these little guys existed but stumbled across them and thought they were pretty cool. I wondered what others thought of them so I jumped on here.<br />Found three at the Dalaran Crater (was headed to a quest nearby) BUT contrary to what people are saying about mornings, server time was 10:45 p.m.<br /><br />Edit: circled the crate and there were a lot, more than a dozen.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>FangedFaerie</b></h3>I spent a few hours trying to farm these guys with a friend. We killed all the Rat critters and battled all the Rat battle pets in the area, and then ranged out a bit and did the same to all the critters/pets nearby. Nothing. <br /><br />We logged back in several hours later and there were tons of them flapping their pages around, though we never saw one as a secondary battle pet.<br /><br />I definitely think they're on a timer.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Grammie</b></h3>Spent all last night waiting for it to appear...killing rat and chipmonk after rat and chipmonk...just logged in this morning...10:25 server time...am...bam he was sitting there waiting for me...they are there but yes they must be on a timer and that timer would be 10:25 server time...29.75, 44.30 to the left of the hangmans noose........</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>xoxkristenkidd</b></h3>I FINALLY GOT ONE!<br />Well, <i>three</i> actually.. ^_^<br />11:17am server time. I created a class trial on the server Dalaran and something compelled me to head to Dalaran Crater. There were so many Lofty Libra so just flapping and flying around. <br />.. It was <b>beautiful</b>.</div>

Definitely seems to be a timer, check in later, feast or famine type thing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jokerdonny</b></h3>If someone is trying to get this guy for the Celestial Tournament, like myself, a good sub that may be easier to get is the Court Scribe from being revered with the Court of Farondis. I personally have had trouble getting the Libram, so if you are just focused on the tournament then I would suggest using the Court Scribe.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SerbianMolotov</b></h3>&quot;I got it&quot; Camped it for 2 hours today nothing spawned, went on other servers still nothing.. Went back there at 5 AM there was alot of them.. So when they spawn and I think mornings is the best, there is alot you will not miss them! <br />TLDR Alarm 5AM, get it and go to sleep.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Skyrixx</b></h3>Can confirm that battling other pets in the area can spawn a Lofty Libram. There were none in the area and I battled a few rats and one appeared @ 9:53pm realm time. It was of poor quality but still got the pet!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>CuteMischief</b></h3>Rose up early and at 9 AM server time the Lofty Librams were everywhere :D I got two greens and a rare in 30 minutes. Don't waste time killing rats. The Lofty Librams seem to spawn early in the morning just like Eldritch Manafiend(another magic).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maizey</b></h3>I needed these to appear when I had time to get one, so I tried the rat-killing method. Killing rats DOES help increase the chance for a spawn if you want to get this over and done with. I arrived when there were no Lofty Librams; killed all the rats on two rounds (did battle a few to see if there was an LL as a secondary, nope) and got six Lofty Libram spawns, three uncommons but no rares.<br /><br />EDIT: Six battles later, a rare. They do spawn!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>toram23901</b></h3>Just wanted to throw in my thoughts about the Lofty Libram...as I spent Easter Sunday -- from 9:30am to 6pm -- on and off -- trying to get a RARE book. I did not get it.<br /><br />But to the whole point, it is not so much killing the extra rats that are running around, but it is battling off all battle pets in the area - really they are either rats or Lofty Librams. It would seem to me that there is only a finite number of battle pets that can spawn in the area. If they are all rats...then it will never be Lofty Librams. So battle off all those rats and force the respawn. It does take a little bit of time for the respawn to happen, especially if you take in a level 25 to do your hunting and can one shot critters.<br /><br />People have said only in the morning does the book spawns, this is not true, as I had the book spawn as a battle pet throughout the day. Just keep battling off what you see in the area.<br /><br />I got tons of Librams...but since I was looking for the rare, I kept at it. I don't know why my RNG was just so bad, but I got zero rare books. I got plenty of rare OTHER pets. No rare Snowshoe Rabbit though, which would have been a good consolation prize.<br /><br />One benefit from running around in circles all day is that I no longer have any pets lower than level 7. I will have to go back another day to try it again.<br /><br />EDIT: After about another month...I finally got my rare libram. Luck of the draw...and my RNG was definitely not going my way. But keep at it if you are hunting for a rare.</div>
