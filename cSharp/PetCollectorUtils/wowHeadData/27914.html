If you run from one place to other he's usually left behind, so you have to wait for him to be at your side again. Second, both you and him must be near your target at the moment of its dead. And finally, it must be YOU the one who delivers the killing shot: hunter and warlock pets continuously interfere with this, so if possible, dismiss your pet. AoE traps or effects also reduces your chance to receive a credit, since is the damage over time, not you, the one that kills your target. Also note if you are in a raid or battleground group, same criteria applies. In the middle of fight, no matter how many times you hit your victims, you and Soul Trader must be close to your target (even if you are ranged), and you must be credited for the killing blow, or he won't give you a reward. \n\nUsing a hunter of my own I can confirm Soul Trader can extract a corpse's essence from range distance, but very, very rarely happens. Most of time he won't reward you a credit unless he's very close to a corpse, so you can try the range attack method if you want, but may take a lot more time to collect all those credits.\n\nNote the Soul-Trader clothing set almost matches those worn by Consortium members, (its quite similar, but not identical), but does NOT fit well all characters. Orcs, Worgen and Tauren look more like wounded half naked warriors than consortium members. This set looks better on Elf and Human races. Keep this in mind before wasting a lot of time collecting credits for a set you won't like.\n\nAs a separated note, nobody has mentioned he glows in the dark. Has a beautiful ghost-like effect similar to spirit beasts. This, plus the fact he's as big as any normal humanoid character, makes this one of the best pets ever. Sadly, on eBay he's very expensive, and usually sells for over 200 bucks.

In any scenario, it's a LOT of gold.  So, what do you get for that?\r\n\r\n[u]Trading with your Soul Trader[\/u]\r\nKilling enemies within the normal experience-granting level bracket while your Soul Trader is around (summoned) will award you with up to one Ethereal Credit.  Normally, you will get one Credit, but the Soul Trader has to perform an animation on the recently killed foe to generate it.  Enemies that despawn immediately when killed will (often) yield no credit.  If you are killing enemies faster than about 1\/second (it can happen), the Soul-Trader will fall behind on his collection and won't go back for any it missed even if their bodies are still around.  In order to qualify for the credit, \"you\" have to get the killing blow against the enemy, but what qualifies as \"you\" seems to be a little loose.  In addition to direct attacks\/spells and AoE you set up, certain special actions (such as having Garona kill a foe during the quest \"An Inside Job\") still count.  In the end, you just accept that it's a little arbitrary when interacting with odd circumstances and accept what you get.\r\n\r\nThe Soul-Trader sells three conjured items (A \"hot potato\" ball, a potion of see invisible, and a drink that might give you a cosmetic transform), one non-conjured consumable (that turns a companion pet into a Flesh Beast model), and a set of cosmetic ethereal wrappings that, sadly, are not eligible for transmogrification.\r\n\r\n[u]Pet Battling with your Soul Trader[\/u]\r\nOddly enough, this is a perfectly good reason to go after the little guy -- his move set is unique and can be very powerful, at least under the right conditions.  Before I get into tactics, a few interesting features:\r\n\r\nWhile summoned at your side, the Soul-Trader is a normal-sized Ethereal.  His reactions to Magical Mini-Treats and Pet Biscuits are based on this size, so it's pretty funny to be walking around with an Ethereal \"pet\" much larger than you are!  \r\n\r\nIn pet battles, however, he shrinks to about the same size as any other companion pet, so sadly he won't be stepping on troublesome enemies.\r\n\r\nLike any pet, the Soul-Trader can't be summoned while he's out of hit points.  This means that you will need to heal your battle pets if he gets knocked out and you want to go back to collecting souls\r\n\r\nHe is \"vulnerable\" the the mutagen he sells, which is kind of cool.\r\n\r\nAs far as strategy goes, the one bad thing about the Soul Trader is that he exists in just one breed: pure balanced.  This is almost never optimal since he doesn't have the speed to go first against many foes but doesn't have the hitting or staying power to make up for it.  Still, that's just a minor quibble\r\n\r\nThe Ethereal's first move is either Punch or Beam.  They're basically the same move, only dealing either humanoid or magical damage.  Both are pretty strong types to have, effective against popular enemies, but among NPC trainers and wild pets, flying-type is vastly more common while against player-controlled dragons, on-type moves will have enhanced effect against the Soul Trader, so I'd prefer Beam in most situations.\r\n\r\nThe second move is rather fascinating: it's either Soul Ward or Inner Vision.  For this, it really depends on what your third move is.  Inner Vision is basically useless if your main damage move is button 1, since you could just use that move twice to the same effect.  Soul Ward is a little dubious on a pet that's not reliably faster than its foes, but it can at least get you some utility over spamming basic damage if you're able to predict when a big hit is incoming.\r\n\r\nThe third move is either Soulrush or Life Exchange.  Both of these are very powerful moves in very different ways -- Soulrush outputs a lot of damage in a burst (great with Inner Vision!) with a chance to stun, while Life Exchange is an extraordinary attrition move: if you can reliably survive taking down one enemy and open up with Exchange on the second, you're looking at a truly glorious amount of damage.  Soulrush implies Inner Vision (since you're trying to out-damage your foe) and to an extent frees you up to take Punch if you're worried about mechanicals ruining your day, while Life Exchange implies Soul Ward (since you're trying to last long enough to fire off a good hit of Life Exchange).  Overall, Soul Rush is a decently fire-and-forget build if you know you're not facing anything that can take a turn of immunity to avoid you, while Life Exchange gives you a lot of advantage if you're dictating the terms of engagement.  Either way, the Soul Trader can really find a place against NPC trainers and wild pets.\r\n\r\nSince the Ethereal Soul-Trader is pretty rare and has a move set that's not shared with other pets (like, say, the TCG Sand Scarab in all its identical-to-other-roaches glory), a lot of players may not know what to expect when facing one.  This makes it a decent choice for an \"all-comers\" PVP team.

His Soulrush spell can defeat opposing pets in one hit. Ethereal Soul Trader is like a heavyweight boxer with a powerful knockout punch. <br /><br />The Netherwhelp is the only other pet with Soulrush.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>elixis</b></h3>After much pondering, and realizing that the more you wait to buy him, the rarer he becomes. I didn't want to wait till he gets even more expensive to buy. So I caved in and got me one. All illidan boxes were sold out and are half the price of the card on ebay, and from my research it's a 1/3 chance to get one in a box if you are lucky to find a box. So you are probably better off just buying the card straight up instead of hoping to get luck with the booster packs. He is SOOOO WORTH IT~! Not only is he uber rare and awesome, but he is also a kick-ass pet! His soulrush coupled first with inner vision is a one shot. Partner him with a pet that stops the opponent from stunning you and you are set! Most expensive wow related thing i've bought, but so so so worth it. As a player of wow since release, I don't regret treating me with something I will enjoy and not everyone has.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>elixis</b></h3>Oh and another observation, when you land, give him a few seconds to come out before killing or else he won't do the soul essence capture. Also I find if you run up to a mob and one shot it and he's too far behind you it won't do it either, so let him catch up to you first.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Oddyssey</b></h3>Saw one of these today for the first time. Never even heard of him before, now I'm so jealous! I would love to have one of these, but OMGosh, the cards go for over $200 on ebay! A little too pricey for me. There are two cards currently on ebay, if anyone's feeling rich. ;)<br /><br />It has the most amazing special effects too... Lots of purple lightening comes out of him to the corpse. A little distracting when in a dungeon, though. But still really cool looking!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kuddles</b></h3>Ranged players may find a bit complicated reunite the credits needed to purchase the complete garment this pet sells since you need to fullfill several conditions to obtain a credit:<br /><br />Soul Trader must be at you side at all times. If you run from one place to other he's usually left behind, so you have to wait for him to be at your side again. Second, both you and him must be near your target at the moment of its dead. And finally, it must be YOU the one who delivers the killing shot: hunter and warlock pets continuously interfere with this, so if possible, dismiss your pet. AoE traps or effects also reduces your chance to receive a credit, since is the damage over time, not you, the one that kills your target. Also note if you are in a raid or battleground group, same criteria applies. In the middle of fight, no matter how many times you hit your victims, you and Soul Trader must be close to your target (even if you are ranged), and you must be credited for the killing blow, or he won't give you a reward. <br /><br />Using a hunter of my own I can confirm Soul Trader can extract a corpse's essence from range distance, but very, very rarely happens. Most of time he won't reward you a credit unless he's very close to a corpse, so you can try the range attack method if you want, but may take a lot more time to collect all those credits.<br /><br />Note the Soul-Trader clothing set almost matches those worn by Consortium members, (its quite similar, but not identical), but does NOT fit well all characters. Orcs, Worgen and Tauren look more like wounded half naked warriors than consortium members. This set looks better on Elf and Human races. Keep this in mind before wasting a lot of time collecting credits for a set you won't like.<br /><br />As a separated note, nobody has mentioned he glows in the dark. Has a beautiful ghost-like effect similar to spirit beasts. This, plus the fact he's as big as any normal humanoid character, makes this one of the best pets ever. Sadly, on eBay he's very expensive, and usually sells for over 200 bucks. Check the in-game AH regularly instead, since you can easily find him for less than 60k</div>

I purchased mine off ebay many years ago for $100... it is now worth much more since the introduction of Pet Battling. It's not the greatest battle pet but it's fun to show off and it is very tall.<br /><br />I named my level 25 soultrader &quot;Mewtwo&quot;</div>

They have insane spawn rate. If you are a ranged class it is even better. Stand on a rock and keep killing mobs one by one, you don't even have to move.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TevishSzat</b></h3><u>Obtaining Your Soul Trader</u><br />The Ethereal Soul-Trader, as a TCG pet, can be obtained one of two ways: either getting the appropriate loot card from the TCG (effectively a real-money investment) or purchasing it off the Auction House from someone who did. the US Median Price for the Soul-Trader is about 26k gold as of this writing, but server economies vary and there's a low enough volume of Soul-Traders that their price is likely to fluctuate wildly: I've seen between half and double that median value. In any scenario, it's a LOT of gold. So, what do you get for that?<br /><br /><u>Trading with your Soul Trader</u><br />Killing enemies within the normal experience-granting level bracket while your Soul Trader is around (summoned) will award you with up to one Ethereal Credit. Normally, you will get one Credit, but the Soul Trader has to perform an animation on the recently killed foe to generate it. Enemies that despawn immediately when killed will (often) yield no credit. If you are killing enemies faster than about 1/second (it can happen), the Soul-Trader will fall behind on his collection and won't go back for any it missed even if their bodies are still around. In order to qualify for the credit, &quot;you&quot; have to get the killing blow against the enemy, but what qualifies as &quot;you&quot; seems to be a little loose. In addition to direct attacks/spells and AoE you set up, certain special actions (such as having Garona kill a foe during the quest &quot;An Inside Job&quot;) still count. In the end, you just accept that it's a little arbitrary when interacting with odd circumstances and accept what you get.<br /><br />The Soul-Trader sells three conjured items (A &quot;hot potato&quot; ball, a potion of see invisible, and a drink that might give you a cosmetic transform), one non-conjured consumable (that turns a companion pet into a Flesh Beast model), and a set of cosmetic ethereal wrappings that, sadly, are not eligible for transmogrification.<br /><br /><u>Pet Battling with your Soul Trader</u><br />Oddly enough, this is a perfectly good reason to go after the little guy -- his move set is unique and can be very powerful, at least under the right conditions. Before I get into tactics, a few interesting features:<br /><br />While summoned at your side, the Soul-Trader is a normal-sized Ethereal. His reactions to Magical Mini-Treats and Pet Biscuits are based on this size, so it's pretty funny to be walking around with an Ethereal &quot;pet&quot; much larger than you are! <br /><br />In pet battles, however, he shrinks to about the same size as any other companion pet, so sadly he won't be stepping on troublesome enemies.<br /><br />Like any pet, the Soul-Trader can't be summoned while he's out of hit points. This means that you will need to heal your battle pets if he gets knocked out and you want to go back to collecting souls<br /><br />He is &quot;vulnerable&quot; the the mutagen he sells, which is kind of cool.<br /><br />As far as strategy goes, the one bad thing about the Soul Trader is that he exists in just one breed: pure balanced. This is almost never optimal since he doesn't have the speed to go first against many foes but doesn't have the hitting or staying power to make up for it. Still, that's just a minor quibble<br /><br />The Ethereal's first move is either Punch or Beam. They're basically the same move, only dealing either humanoid or magical damage. Both are pretty strong types to have, effective against popular enemies, but among NPC trainers and wild pets, flying-type is vastly more common while against player-controlled dragons, on-type moves will have enhanced effect against the Soul Trader, so I'd prefer Beam in most situations.<br /><br />The second move is rather fascinating: it's either Soul Ward or Inner Vision. For this, it really depends on what your third move is. Inner Vision is basically useless if your main damage move is button 1, since you could just use that move twice to the same effect. Soul Ward is a little dubious on a pet that's not reliably faster than its foes, but it can at least get you some utility over spamming basic damage if you're able to predict when a big hit is incoming.<br /><br />The third move is either Soulrush or Life Exchange. Both of these are very powerful moves in very different ways -- Soulrush outputs a lot of damage in a burst (great with Inner Vision!) with a chance to stun, while Life Exchange is an extraordinary attrition move: if you can reliably survive taking down one enemy and open up with Exchange on the second, you're looking at a truly glorious amount of damage. Soulrush implies Inner Vision (since you're trying to out-damage your foe) and to an extent frees you up to take Punch if you're worried about mechanicals ruining your day, while Life Exchange implies Soul Ward (since you're trying to last long enough to fire off a good hit of Life Exchange). Overall, Soul Rush is a decently fire-and-forget build if you know you're not facing anything that can take a turn of immunity to avoid you, while Life Exchange gives you a lot of advantage if you're dictating the terms of engagement. Either way, the Soul Trader can really find a place against NPC trainers and wild pets.<br /><br />Since the Ethereal Soul-Trader is pretty rare and has a move set that's not shared with other pets (like, say, the TCG Sand Scarab in all its identical-to-other-roaches glory), a lot of players may not know what to expect when facing one. This makes it a decent choice for an &quot;all-comers&quot; PVP team. (One that's not trying to build its own combo since the Soul Trader doesn't really play well with any common synergies.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Taitai</b></h3>Trying to figure out how rare this pet is.<br />I know it's a card reward, but rarely a day goes by that I don't see at least one on the AH (EU-Bronzebeard) for relatively reasonable prices (compared to the prices listed here).<br />I imagine that over time it might get rarer or there might be less demand for it (which can explain the drop of price).<br />Bought it for 33k, still have mixed feelings about it (it is an awesome battle pet though).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1173640</b></h3>If you're going to farm credits for this guy as a level 1 character, the easiest way is by killing critters. The absolute best place I've found for farming (as level 1) is in the Deeprun Tram, because the rats there will respawn instantly.<br /><br />Go to the Ironforge side of the Deeprun Tram and start killing rats. Try to find a respawn point for one of them and kill it over and over again. Getting enough credits to buy the whole set will take you about 1-2 hours. Remember to equip a fast weapon as any hit will kill the rat.<br /><br />Happy farming!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>xNeroth</b></h3>I find that a great way to get Ethereal Credits while doing nothing but watching television is to park yourself and a felhunter at the Akama fight in The Black Temple at level 80. Put the felhunter in defensive stance and he will kill off the spawning mobs that attack you and you can sit back and sip tea and watch television. It should net between 75-100 credits per 10-15 minutes and you can do whatever you want outside of the game while it happens.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Whittall</b></h3>If anyone's farming for credits in Dragonflight, a good place to go is Hellfire Citadel. After Socrethar the Eternal, the 4 portals you need to remove to continue on will spawn demons that for some reason give you credits, even at max level. Park yourself in the middle of the room with all 4 portals up and it will endlessly spawn mobs that will target you automatically.<br /><br />Edit: Went on my protection paladin and found out the easiest way is to stand in the boss room before and LOS the enemies into the room and kill them one by one. You can easily get 100 credits every 5 minutes so long as you stagger the kills!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zincite</b></h3>Nice place for Dragonflight characters is Dreadsnare Cavern in Ohn'ahran Plains, which is in a cave by the river, almost directly south-east of Nokhudon Hold.<br /><br />Cavern is filled with:<br />- Relatively few full-size spider mobs.<br />- Plenty of small spiderlings. These have tiny mob health bars and very little health, but still grant ethereal credits.<br />- Plenty of spider eggs. These <i>also</i> give ethereal credits, but that's just the icing on the cake. The good part is that when you kill a spider egg it spawns 2-3 more small spiderlings which, when killed, give ethereal credits as well!<br /><br />There's a bit of a trick to it because the spiderlings which spawn from the eggs die of their own accord after 20-30 seconds, so you have to kill them quick. But you can't use AoE abilities to burst them down because because you have to stagger out their deaths to let the soultrader work. But when done carefully you can get 3-4 credits from each egg, burn the spiderlings on the floor for easy extra and there's few enough of the big ones you're never really at risk.</div>
