Maybe considered a daily?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>meganerd18</b></h3>Killed the Matriarch, first time ever killing one and doing the WQ, and I see nothing. Those 'co-ordinates' posts don't really help since there are no co-ordinates in the default UI. And Blizzard will probably break those add-ons next.<br /><br />UPDATE: If you lack co-ordinate addons, or are reading this in the future after that convenience has also been broken, then this Hatchling spawns in the clump of rocks south of the Matriarch's Nest. Still in the delta, on a sand bar with a single broken pillar.<br />--<br />Really? That's the part you react to? Is annoyance at a change really that offensive? So I sassed a change, what's the big deal? If it upset you this much, then I'll say that I'm largely over it now. There, happy? And yes, I genuinely have gotten over it.<br /><br />And no, just giving co-ordinates for co-ordinate add-ons is not particularly helpful unless you have those addons. Yes, those addons exist. But no, it shouldn't be a requirement for the comments here to be helpful. There are many reasons why people might not have them; maybe they like playing bog standard, maybe they don't want to risk the UI getting corrupted and having to waste time with a full UI reset, maybe they don't know about them. But the bottom line is just giving co-ordinates, while helpful to some, is hardly comprehensive. Why not co-ordinates <i>and</i> a description of the spot?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>vindurza</b></h3>after you kill the matriarch they tend to spawn a little ways away from the mob check the island around the middle they are an npc not a battle they are also quite small</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Missingbird</b></h3>If you're having trouble getting the Orphan to spawn, make sure that you're the first one to hit the Matriarch. It might also just take a short time for the orphan to spawn after killing it, so check back after a few minutes or after zoning.<br /><br />Anyways this little guy likes to squawk out &quot;Erk!&quot; and &quot;Baroo!&quot; at random intervals, which is visible to other players. He also darts about frantically sometimes. Not sure if these behaviors are shared by other Falcosaur hatchlings though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SnowyIVu</b></h3>Track if you've killed the Matriarch:<br /><br />/dump IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(44882)<br /><br />This seems BUGGED for... parties? Maybe? I couldn't get this completed while I was a party leader and as soon as I left the party, logged out and back in, I was able to get this set to true the next Matriarch I killed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Telesilla</b></h3>Killed the matriarch 5 times before this lil guy popped up by the rocks. My theory is that even though the boss is technically shared by both factions, the quest only works for the faction that got the first hit on the Matriarch, as the the fifth kill was the only time horde attacked first.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dalee</b></h3>So, after doing this. Here's what I've found out: <br /><br />- Yes, the little guy does spawn at 35, 7.5. (Little island with a group of rocks, he has a yellow name over his head)<br />- Yes, the matriarch spawns it. <br />- No, killing the matriarch does not always spawn it for some reason, but I think you should just keep trying.<br />-Yes if you complete the world quest (AND the world quest is still up for others), the pet will still spawn (assuming the matriarch spawns it for that kill.)<br /><br />Note: Me and my groupies left the party and were roaming singly, don't know if this mattered or not. Also, we didn't have to feed the little guy a grape... I have no idea if that is a bug or not, but I'd keep a grape on you &quot;just&quot; in case.<br /><br />--- I hope this clears this up for people who had the same questions I had. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>707155</b></h3>For those curious the nature for this one is P/S. That is assuming each different hatchling only has 1 nature...at the very least it *can* be P/S</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ladynagini</b></h3>Can be found in Azsuna at 35.5, 7.5 after killing the matriarch. Like all the hatchlings, there seems to be a spawn chance rather then 100%. Sometimes it will take a few kills before it spawns. <br /><br />There seems to be no limit to obtaining them, as i obtained both this and the snowfeather hatchling within an hour of eachother (1 and 5 kills required to spawn the hatchling, respectively.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>RhayelV</b></h3>I don't get a quest from him when I first capture it. Also I don't get a quest after he reaches lvl 25. I used the stone you get from your garrison. I just started pet battles today. Do I need to do the Stormwind quests for this quest to appear or is it bugged for me.

I have exciting news for you!<br />Level 3 Garrisons will allow you to pick up <a href="/item=122457/ultimate-battle-training-stone">Ultimate Battle-Training Stone</a> from <a href="/npc=85418/lio-the-lioness">Lio the Lioness</a>, the quest you need to do is <a href="/quest=38241/unearthed-magic">Unearthed Magic</a>/<a href="/quest=38242/unearthed-magic">Unearthed Magic</a> and only involves you running to the entrance of your Garrison mine. Easy.<br /><br />Just make sure you start the quest for each hatchling on a level 110 character (I say this because my sneaky level 25 stone abuse alts were only 100), and log over to your alt, summon your desired hatchling, and right-click the stone directly on to the summoned baby raptor. Voila. You can complete the quest on the alt if you so desire for some XP.<br /><br />Edit: It may also be worth noting that you can bank your <a href="/item=122457/ultimate-battle-training-stone">Ultimate Battle-Training Stone</a> from <a href="/quest=39042/the-very-best">The Very Best</a> during the Pet Battle Week Holiday if you haven't caught all four hatchlings yet, and if you haven't got stones left from your Garrisons.</div>

They are account-wide quests and the cooldown can be skipped this way.<br /><br />Also, not every waiting period is a day.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Weasei</b></h3>As of Patch 7.1 there are 4 new Falcosaur pets. Each of the pets is associated with a different world quest around the Broken Isles. These pets all provide a quest chain to obtain a different mount. These quest chains require a couple of weeks to complete as each subsequent quest becomes available from your summoned pet after the daily reset after completing the previous quest.<br /><br />To get each pet, you must first kill the Matriarch in the world quest area, which will cause the NPC version of the pet to spawn. The next step is to go to the NPC and interact with it and feed it its favourite food. If you don't have the food, you won't obtain the pet. There are vendors selling the required foods at the closest flightpaths to each world quest for most of these so just remember to pick some up on your way there!<br /><br />Important note on orphans: I've encountered issues with the orphans not spawning after killing the matriarch. This isn't affected by the matriarch's nest but it does seem to be affected by getting the last hit on the matriarch. If you can't see the orphan after killing the matriarch then you may need to wait for the respawn. To check if you have completed the requirements to see the orphan run the scripts below.<br /><br /><b><a href="/npc=115784/snowfeather-hatchling">Snowfeather Hatchling</a></b> - <a href="/quest=44892/snowfeather-swarm">Snowfeather Swarm!</a><br />This pet can be picked up from <a href="/npc=115737/orphaned-snowfeather">Orphaned Snowfeather</a> in Highmountain (/way Highmountain 32.5, 28.2) after killing the <a href="/npc=115673/snowfeather-matriarch">Snowfeather Matriarch</a> (/way Highmountain 35.1, 21.9).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>spudz76</b></h3>Depending on how many alts you have, you can get these quests done in a day or two. As soon as you've completed a quest on one character, hop on to another, summon the Hatchling and it will have the next quest in the chain. You can also do all 4 questlines at the same time.<br /><br />Edit 1<br />Hmm, looks like this is incorrect. I was able to do the Bloodgazer this way. I started the Direbeak and Sharptalon just now, brought them both to their respective inns in Darnassus and Iron Forge (Playing on Alli toons), hopped on my mage and no quests. Maybe later in the chain this will work. I'll keep this updated as what works for one should work for all unless of course bugged and unintentional.<br /><br />Edit 2<br />After you do the first pet battle quest (Fight 3 WQ pet battles) You can now hop on alts and continue the quest chain.<br /><br />Edit 3<br />After the dungeon quests they've stopped giving quests on alts again. This doesn't really make sense<br /><br />Tip: When doing the 3 pet battles, do not forget to summon the required hatchling along with having it in the team.

This can be learned from the pet battle trainer in Stormwind or Orgrimmar. I didn't get the quest for weeks, opened a ticket and this is what a gamemaster told me to do. Upon learning pet battling, I had to relog, and once I logged in they offered me the quest!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>starsofdestiny</b></h3>This whole quest chain is absolutely adorable.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DaemoniKira</b></h3><div class="quote-box">Though they may look fierce, the bloodgazer species of falcosaur has a beak that makes it predisposed to consuming fruits.</div><br /><br />...But it has the <i>same exact</i> beak as all three of the other Hatchlings... o.o</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ye7i</b></h3>I have been able to complete multiple dailies for each hatchling during the same day by using alt characters. At first, I thought this method required an alt from another faction, but it doesn't seem to matter as I did more testing.<br /><br />Important Note: Accept and complete the dailies on one character first, then move to an alt and summon the hatchlings again to get the next set of dailies during the same day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Locopoco</b></h3>Although these quests with the pet are locked to the daily lockout, if you complete one, switch to an alt, summon the pet you can do another quest in the chain. It has even sometimes allowed the main to have another quest with pet out if you switch back to them</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>favebook</b></h3>If you are using <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=122457/ultimate-battle-training-stone">Ultimate Battle-Training Stone</a> on your pets while the quest is active, it may not auto-complete. Relogging/reloading, dismissing the pet or changing to an alt may not auto-complete either. Resolution is to abandon the quest and take it again - it will auto-complete instantly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lolo0426</b></h3>Make sure you get some Azsunian Grapes. I was able to get them at the Inn, in Dalaran, from Bartan. I killed the Matriarch at (35.23, 5.17. <br /> I looted and went to coordinates (35.54, 7.48) and the hatchling was there.</div>
