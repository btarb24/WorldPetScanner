<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>johankj</b></h3>where is unphased area in this zone btw?<br />Run like every area and still nothing :( i mean i can't se my friend.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zappadohdah</b></h3>Is there any way to see this little one after phasing by yoursef?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>pixila</b></h3>Part of the achievement <a href="/achievement=6350/to-all-the-squirrels-i-once-caressed">To All the Squirrels I Once Caressed?</a>To All the Squirrels I Once Caressed?<br /><br />Got with a friend - me on my 85 unphased priest and him on his 90 paladin. <br /><br />This critter is only available for people who haven't done any quests in Valley of the Four Winds. If you are 90, at the present time (patch 5.0.5), you will not be able to find any of these. You and your friend will be in different phases so you will need to run to an unphased area so you can see your friend and he can get/grant you the chance to get the achievement.<br /><br />I went to the Whitepetal Lake, near the Golden Lotus quest hub, did a /tar danc and found one of this guys to feed a <a href="/item=43004/critter-bites">Critter Bites</a> to. Then I ran toward the Summer Fields, northeast of Tu Shen Burial Ground, where my friend was. As soon as you change 'zones', the 90 player becomes visible and he can /love the Dancing Water Skimmer.<br /><br />Tip: Test first where is the place you phase with your friend before you go search for the nearest Dancing Water Skimmer. You only have 3 minutes to run and if you mount, your critter will stand still and despawn, so you will have to run. I found mine right at the L on the writing of Whitepetal Lake.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>meruhd</b></h3>For those wondering where unphased areas are, easiest way is to run around with your unphased friend in a group until you see each other. I tried areas that were listed here (just east of Whitepetal Lake, north of Tu Shen burial grounds), but all of those areas were phased out for me. Then we tried the gate entrance to the Vale on the western side of the map. It was a long way to run, but with a macro I was able to get the achievement with no issues.<br /><br />/tar Danc<br />/love</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sarasin</b></h3>What is Phasing? Never heard of it...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>shogunvin</b></h3>i got a friend doing that for me and the skimmer dissapears when he moves towards the zone we are not shifted</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>126915</b></h3>If you're looking for the battle pet version, they can show up as joiners when fighting the Golden Civets and Golden Civet Kittens. Check the North corner of the lake, on the West side of Mogushan Palace, for a couple packs of Civets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Niaw</b></h3>This page is for the <b>battle pet</b> version of the Dancing Water Skimmer. The regular critter version is: <a href="/npc=65209/dancing-water-skimmer">Dancing Water Skimmer</a>.<br /><br />They can be found in groups throughout the waterways of the Vale, but seem to be less frequent than the <a href="/npc=61088/eternal-strider">Eternal Strider</a>s.<br /><br />Before patch 5.2 they phased out once you started the Golden Lotus quests. This is now fixed. You'll probably still find more as secondaries in fights with other battle pets in the Vale, such as <a href="/npc=63841/golden-civet">Golden Civet</a>s.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sarasin</b></h3>Do this in Temple of Kotmogu (BG) - South of the temple they are all over the place :D<br /><br />Very easy with macro-spam:<br /><br />/tar danc<br />/love<br /><br />I was one of those who did Valley of Eternal Blossoms questing before the achievement, ergo this was my only option. Worked perfectly.(##RESPBREAK##)16##DELIM##Sas148##DELIM##This comment is for <a href="/npc=65209/dancing-water-skimmer">Dancing Water Skimmer</a>. Unfortunately I have no way of moving it so it'll remain here as it seems to be helpful for quite a few.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hashupa</b></h3>I was able to find one of these as a secondary to a Yellow Bellied Bullfrog.<br /><br />I have no idea if this was bad luck or what, but it avoided over 15 traps in a row and managed to kill off an entire team of rare quality level 25 pets. So they may have a much lower capture rate than other pets... But, then again, I could be extremely unlucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ShrekfromAzgalor</b></h3>If you battle pets in that area, you'll find them as 2nd/3rd pets in a battle. Tame them and then summon them. Select your companion, then type /love..works like a charm!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zahniya</b></h3>If you are having trouble finding this critter due to area phasing, if you have been doing your pet battles just battle some critters in the area and it might pop up as a guest in battle. Catch it, /love it and there's this part of the <a href="/achievement=6350/to-all-the-squirrels-i-once-caressed">To All the Squirrels I Once Caressed?</a> complete.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>methusalem</b></h3>rare version available?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Deauminatrix</b></h3>I just confirmed... if you are past the point that it is phased and need it for the /love achieve you can in fact tame it as a secondary pet from a Golden Civet and once you have it as a pet, summon it and /love it and you will get credit!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1068051</b></h3>A guildie captured one for me and we had to go almost to Two Moons before we were in the same phase. Bit of a muck up, Blizz?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Eillesthis</b></h3>These guys can also be found as secondary pets when battling <a href="/npc=61088/eternal-strider">Eternal Strider</a>s. Just fight a whole bunch of them, and forfeit if you don't get what you want. Or kill them to level your flying pets (most of the time you will get three aquatic enemies). Skimmers share abilities with the other aquatic insects (Striders), so there's no reason to keep going for a rare unless you're one of those people who must do so.<br /><br />And yes, as with all lovable critters, once you get one you can summon it and /love it for the achievement, in lieu of loving the similarly hard to find critter version <a href="/npc=65209/dancing-water-skimmer">Dancing Water Skimmer</a>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Eclipsegirl</b></h3>Today, the first day of 5.2 I found the the Dancing water skimmer in the middle of Whitepetal lake.<br /><br />I quests I was given were <br />The Moving Mists<br />Fiery Tongue, Fragile Feet<br />A Weighty Task<br />Stick in the Mud</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>natassja72</b></h3>From what I found since 5.2 Dancing Water Skimmers that are &quot;battleable&quot; only seem to spawn in the middle of the Whitepetal Lake and impossible to engage because of the<b> <u>&quot;battle area is obstructed&quot;</u> </b>constant error.<br />The only way to combat them was to aggro one of them and kite away from the lake untill they drop combat while simultaneously pressing &quot;interact with target&quot; keybind fast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>900692</b></h3>As of Patch 5.4, There are around 6 battle ready dancing skimmers at to the left of mistfall village (30.7,78.2). Seems like one of the few watering holes left on Vale. They are a little tough to battle seeing you have to get them on a good lilypad but doable.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>aprildawn567</b></h3>As of 4/5/13, these spawn at 34,79-- slightly SW of Mistfall Village. They spawn as secondaries to Eternal Striders. The battle area is perfectly clear (not on water or lily pads), with about 5 or 6 spawns. They respawn fairly quickly. After 5 battles, they were already starting to respawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kevb70</b></h3>The striders have been my favorite for the pet tamer outside half hill. Sunflower -&gt; Turnip -&gt; Worm<br /><br />Pump -&gt; Cleansing Rain -&gt; *Pump* -&gt; Pump -&gt; Water Jet til Sunflower dead<br />*Pump* -&gt; Cleansing Rain -&gt; Pump -&gt; Water Jet til Turnip dead<br />Water Jet (die)<br /><br />The strider will kill the first two pets and get one hit on the worm before dying.- with a non-power strider.(I'm currently hunting one to fine tune the sequence)<br /><br />Bring in your low level, then finish off the worm with a lvl 20-24 <br />Keep an alt out at halfhill for this easy way to carry a low level</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>epicmage</b></h3>I am somewhat new to pet battling. If I am reading this right there are 4 variations of this pet in game but you can only capture and possess 3?</div>

They are just west of the bottom of the steps to Mogu'Shan Palace just chilling with a few Sha down there. You don't have to fight a million battles to find them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Persymphony</b></h3>Just found one as a tag along additional pet with a Thornclaw Broodling in Felsoul Hold in Suramar.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Niinaa</b></h3>For ppl who looking for the pet Dancing water skimmer, for the achievement &quot;To all the Squirrels i once Caressed&quot;, and if u have start doing alot of Quest around eternal Blossom like i had (and the map looks different,) u can find the pet at 29,71 (in Eternal Blossom)</div>
