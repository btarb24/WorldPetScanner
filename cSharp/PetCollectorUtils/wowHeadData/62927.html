A few facts about this pet, as of patch 5.4:\n\n[ul]\n[li]Arguably, the best breed for pet battles is P\/P. The pet comes in three other breeds (H\/H, H\/P and H\/S).[\/li]\n[li]It is no longer a rare spawn. There are just as many of these  around as any other pet. HOWEVER, a rare blue spawn is still very difficult to find. Out of 338 battles, I only came across 2 rares. [\/li]\n[li]This pet has two abilities that do damage to you and to itself, which means it can essentially commit \"suicide\" before you can capture it. (Both of the rares I found killed themselves. Yay.)[\/li]\n[li]If you kill it, or it kills itself, there's no way to get it back. You can no longer log out and have it respawn when you log back in. That has been hotfixed, unfortunately.[\/li]\n[li]To mitigate the chance of your rare killing itself, battle with [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=236]critter[\/url] pets, and use any kind of stun ability so you can to give yourself an extra round of cage throwing.[\/li]\n[li]Turkey pets have an awesome ability called [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=580]Food Coma[\/url] which can make the target sleep for two rounds, thus giving you two more chances to capture. Just use it when the Geode is at low enough health to trap, and then throw the trap until you capture.[\/li]\n[li]Pets with [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=277]Life Exchange[\/url] are also a good choice, as they can heal the enemy as well as yourself. ([url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=27914]Ethereal Soul Trader[\/url], [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=62395]Nether Faerie Dragon[\/url], [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=68658]Mini Mindslayer[\/url] and [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=9662]Sprite Darter Hatchling[\/url], to name a few.)[\/li]\n[li]Don't even bother trying to capture this pet until you have been awarded AT LEAST [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=77]Strong Trap[\/url], and preferably [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=135]Pristine Trap[\/url]. Using a lesser traps just means it will take a lot more throws to capture it and it will likely kill itself in the meantime.[\/li]\n[li]Bottom line: save yourself some time. Capture a breed P\/P of any quality and [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/item=98715]Battle-Stone[\/url] it. Just trust me on this. It will be the best stone you ever spent.[\/li]\n[li]If you are crazy enough to try capturing a rare in the wild, start with this pet when you enter the zone. Nine out of eleven of the other wild pets in this zone spawn as secondaries to the Crimson Geode. You will likely find all of them as rares before you get your rare Geode.[\/li]\n[\/ul]\n\nGood luck!","date":"2013-10-12T03:26:56-05:00","rating":19,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2013-10-12T03:28:34-05:00",1,"Alaurynn"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":27,"id":1912458,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"solinvictus","body":"A nice way to get this is to use a pet with [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=404]Sunlight[\/url] Abiltiy (like [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=63365]Terrible Turnip[\/url]).

After experiencing a battle during which the geode did supermassive damage to my pet and...ahhem...sigh...himself killing himself, I had to create an account on here for the first time to leave this comment. Lmao! Good luck catching his rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>FatCheeseMan</b></h3>This pet has a lot of self damaging attacks, making it a difficult catch, I recommend letting it damage itself to get into catch range. This should give you maximum turns to catch it before it kills itself. CC if you can do it, such as the great and powerful <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=580">food coma</a>, will help a good deal in catching this interesting battle pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>normajt</b></h3>captured rare, he had just over 1100hp b4 capt. after has following stats: 1247/270/205<br />Sry for not posting after capture lvl, however the purpose was for those NOT using addons to have an idea if they may have themselves a rare or not. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>aspasito</b></h3>As the spell (Stone Rush) that hurts both you and the geode is of Elemental type, if your front pet is resistant to this type of spell (is a critter type pet), you have a longer time to catch it. Also, having a level 25 will add to the Geode's chance to miss, thus not hurt itself. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Grukam</b></h3>Typically RNG hates me but my first return trip to farm these my very first one was a rare and a cap. Upgrade from my first cap which was an uncommon. So miracles can happen. :) <br /><br />Edit 1; BTW while there are a lot more of these on the crimson expanse, they are much lower lvls. My best finds even after the first cap above were all at twilight precipice. I was still looking for rare twilight beetles and others. <br /><br />Great addon too. Battle Pets Quality Notifier. If you don't have it get it from Curse. As soon as you engage a BP it will tell you in your chat window the quality of all the pets drawn for that battle, whether you have them and/or if they're an upgrade.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>spiralofhope</b></h3>Be aware that (1) If you don't kill nearby mobs, they can aggro onto you and abort your fight. (2) If your fight is aborted, the battleable-critter doesn't vanish. (3) If you re-engage that same critter, it can have different abilities selected. I know this because I marked my critter before starting the battle. I got lucky, and had my first one with its kill-self ability aborted, then the second one had elementium bolt instead. No need to grind for a rare as 5.1 will give us the ability to upgrade pet rarity.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rhinoloupe</b></h3>Does not appear as a secondary pet. You can only challenge them directly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>683070</b></h3>I'm not sure if these spawn in waves or something, but I found 7 of them up on a high pop realm where most rare pets are pretty heavily camped. Perhaps it was just good luck?<br /><br />Good luck to anyone else looking for theirs!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>378260</b></h3><u><b>Rare hunters, take note!</b></u><br /><br />Alt+f4ing, exiting the game, or otherwise disconnecting will reset any pet battle so long as one pet in the encounter is still alive. After you re-enter the game, the pet will have respawned in the same spot with the same battle configuration, including add-on pets and rarity (if any). <br /><br />Any pet abilities in the encounter may be re-rolled when using this method.<br /><br /><i>So if you accidentally kill a rare battle pet, you can reset the encounter so long as one other pet is still alive.</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1043922</b></h3>I found several of these in the cave at Verlok Stand. They are tricky to capture alive! I did it with a 23 level turtle, just had to get it to low enough health for capture quickly and then hope the trap lands. Took a couple tries just to get a poor quality one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Grubitsch</b></h3>So the pet you've been wanting to capture dies in battle. There's a very simple solution! If you log out and back in while the battle is still going on, you're pet-to-be will be where it was before you initiated battle with it. It'll be the same level, rarity, and even have the same allies. The only thing that's different is their abilities might switch around.<br />(On a side note, your pet's health remains decreased if it was decreased during the battle)<br /><br />Edit: This has been fixed. Sorry, pet battlers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>908415</b></h3>Got very lucky. Got a rare on my 3rd try and it captured on the first trap. Only had to use level 22 Garden frog to cap the geode and defeat the other two add ins.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>illiterate</b></h3>It's a little annoying catching this little bugger as he likes to suicide. A pet such as hopling can be useful for the stun which will give you an extra box toss.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Necarie</b></h3>If you have trouble catching a rare or just want a different color, an alternative is the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=67282">Elementium Geode</a> from mining. It's rare quality and uses the same attacks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Chibchub123</b></h3>My strategy for catching this as a rare!<br /><br />Pet used: <a href="/npc=62998/mirror-strider">Mirror Strider</a> Level 25 rare. Speed 305, Power 257.<br />Abilities: Water Jet and Soothe.<br /><br />Moves used in battle 1: (NOTE: First rare I found did NOT have Stone Rush!)<br />Me - Water Jet<br />Geode - Elementium Bolt<br />Me - Water Jet<br />Geode - Crystal Overload<br />Me - Soothe<br />Geode - Feedback (NOTE: This damage dealt back to him by Crystal Overload did NOT break the Soothe!)<br />Me - Pet Trap<br />Me - Pet Trap (Great success!)<br /><br />Moves used in battle 2: (NOTE: This time it DID have Stone Rush and it DOES break Soothe!.)<br />Me - Water Jet<br />Geode - Crystal Overload<br />Me - Water Jet<br />Geode - Spark<br />Me - Pass<br />Geode - Crystal Overload<br />Me - Soothe<br />Geode - Spark<br />Geode - Crystal Overload<br />Me - Pet Trap (Great success)<br /><br />This way still involves luck, but all you have to do is log out if the pet dies or does stone rush following your soothe.<br />It may be worth noting, if you go AFTER the geode with a slower pet your chances may be better, for instance... If he does Stone Rush, then you use Soothe, good chance he may do Crystal Overload/Other damage ability on your next turn (which you will pass on) and get him to fall asleep for two rounds. You'll still want at least a Strong Trap for this, Pristine would be BEST but not needed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aquifel</b></h3>My 2nd one of these was a rare, it worked very hard to kill itself, knocking its health down to catchable without me actually performing any attacks (aquatic pet buffs), managed to catch him with only 7 of his hp remaining.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SickRose</b></h3>If you've suffered through finding the perfect rare of this mob only to have it suicide, make sure one of your back up pets while capturing it is a pet with Life Exchange (Nether Faerie Dragon is my preference, also available to Ethereal Soul Trader, Sprite Darter Hatchling, and Mini Mindslayer) as it's effect, &quot;Equalizes the health between the user and his enemy.&quot;, can go both ways and restore health to an enemy pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>690902</b></h3>I used Highlands Turkey - Food Coma once the Geode was low enough in health to try to capture. Does no damage and puts our little friend to sleep for 2 rounds. Hopefully at the end you have him bagged.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>pmakaro</b></h3>This is easily the worst of the Deepholm pets to get a rare of. <br /><br /><ol><li>Primary only pet.</li><li>Uncommon spawn.</li><li>Self damaging attacks.</li></ol><br /><br />Be prepared to hunker down for a farm fest. I would not even bother working on the other pets in the zone until you get your rare of this one. You are likely to get rares of all the shale hatchlings as secondaries just trying for the geode.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>akatnel</b></h3>I found lots of these up at the Crimson Expanse, down at Twilight Precipice, and scattered across several little ledges between Twilight Precipice and Verlok Stand.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>923022</b></h3>Have to admit, some admiration for Blizz's sense of humor. Adding to the way, way low odds of finding a Rare, having it then suicide is kinda over the top. <br /><br />183 battles, with exactly two Rares. and both offed themselves. Should be more pissed off, but is sort of funny.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1113486</b></h3>It look likes people have problems with this dude :) i think i used about 5 min to find a rare 1( around 07:50 in the morning server time) and then i used my level 25 Winter's Little Helper, 2 spells from me and then it was mine &lt;3 good luck getting it :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Alaurynn</b></h3>A lot of the information posted here is outdated or buried, so I'm writing some updated info for those interested in finding this pet as a rare. A few facts about this pet, as of patch 5.4:<br /><br /><ul><li>Arguably, the best breed for pet battles is P/P. The pet comes in three other breeds (H/H, H/P and H/S).</li><li>It is no longer a rare spawn. There are just as many of these around as any other pet. HOWEVER, a rare blue spawn is still very difficult to find. Out of 338 battles, I only came across 2 rares. </li><li>This pet has two abilities that do damage to you and to itself, which means it can essentially commit &quot;suicide&quot; before you can capture it. (Both of the rares I found killed themselves. Yay.)</li><li>If you kill it, or it kills itself, there's no way to get it back. You can no longer log out and have it respawn when you log back in. That has been hotfixed, unfortunately.</li><li>To mitigate the chance of your rare killing itself, battle with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=236">critter</a> pets, and use any kind of stun ability so you can to give yourself an extra round of cage throwing.</li><li>Turkey pets have an awesome ability called <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=580">Food Coma</a> which can make the target sleep for two rounds, thus giving you two more chances to capture. Just use it when the Geode is at low enough health to trap, and then throw the trap until you capture.</li><li>Pets with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=277">Life Exchange</a> are also a good choice, as they can heal the enemy as well as yourself. (<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=27914">Ethereal Soul Trader</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62395">Nether Faerie Dragon</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=68658">Mini Mindslayer</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=9662">Sprite Darter Hatchling</a>, to name a few.)</li><li>Don't even bother trying to capture this pet until you have been awarded AT LEAST <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=77">Strong Trap</a>, and preferably <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=135">Pristine Trap</a>. Using a lesser traps just means it will take a lot more throws to capture it and it will likely kill itself in the meantime.</li><li>Bottom line: save yourself some time. Capture a breed P/P of any quality and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=98715">Battle-Stone</a> it. Just trust me on this. It will be the best stone you ever spent.</li><li>If you are crazy enough to try capturing a rare in the wild, start with this pet when you enter the zone. Nine out of eleven of the other wild pets in this zone spawn as secondaries to the Crimson Geode. You will likely find all of them as rares before you get your rare Geode.</li></ul><br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>solinvictus</b></h3>A nice way to get this is to use a pet with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=404">Sunlight</a> Abiltiy (like <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63365">Terrible Turnip</a>). Use it at the beginning of the fight to increase the Geode's health. When he drops below %35 percent he'll still have enough health to survive a few of his self damaging abilities.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Chumpacabra</b></h3>I hunkered down in Deepholm on an alt tonight to do some pet farming/pet leveling and character leveling because, hey, if I'm going to be doing pet battles anyway, I might as well do it on a toon that isn't at max level. I spent the whole night looking for a P/P <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62915">Emerald Shale Hatchling</a>, leveling from 83 to 85 and several battle pets into the low 20s. I only found three P/P Hatchlings overall, and the first two wound up killing themselves before I could trap them -- oh, and during that whole duration I didn't even find a single rare Shale Hatchling, regardless of breed. <br /><br />So, needless to say, when I finished farming that and began reading the comments on this page for the Crimson Geode, I started to lose hope. A rare spawn pet with a P/P breed and two moves that damage it? I just about logged off then and there. But I decided to procrastinate sleep in lieu of WoW once again, and trudged over to the Crimson Expanse. It didn't take me long to find my first Geode and as soon as I got into battle with it I noticed it was Rare, so I thought, <i>Okay, I'll just take this rare for now, regardless of breed -- what is the breed anyway?</i><br /><br />Power/power. And rare. I was elated. But I was also terrified. What if it broke itself on my (pet's) body, like the Shale Hatchlings had done? Well, then I looked at its moveset -- yeah, you guessed it, it wasn't using any of its self damaging moves.<br /><br />Anyway the point of this whole thing is that miracles happen! It could happen to you, so don't give up hope! Maybe not this pet, but it could be an Unborn Val'kyr, or a Baby Ape. You never know, so keep your chin up and try not to wake people up like I did when it finally happens to you. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Balthazaar</b></h3>I collected 2 by this very easy method. Use a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63365">Terrible Turnip</a>, bring the Crimson Geode down to about half health, then apply <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=404">Sunlight</a> which increases the health of all pets (including the enemy pet) by 50%, thus giving you more time to capture it while it is at under 30% of its max health value. :)<br /><br />Cheers and Good Hunting :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wawatooki</b></h3>It doesnt make any sense, im getting breeds that dont even have possible stats how does this make any sense? i see level 24 commons with 1223 hp, 207 power, and 216 speed. HOW doES THIS MAKE SENSE?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Curaipally</b></h3>Found this one fairly easy to catch. Took me a while to find a rare one, but when I did I used my idol and crushed him once, then sandstorm and it stopped pretty much all of his suicidal damage. I caught him 4th attempt without a problem. I did have a Nether Faerie Dragon just in case :) Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>asakurato</b></h3>I think it was changed, because I haven't seen Crimson geode that had Stone rush, all of them had Elementium Bolt.</div>
