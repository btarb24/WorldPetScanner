<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wollbane</b></h3>I wonder if this guy is actually unintentionally undertuned. Wowhead lists 2700 hp, but for me in game it's 2303 and that's not even elite. To top it off he has 202 attack and 138 health and his abilities are Deep Bite, Spiked Shell and Whirlpool. He might literally be the easiest pet battle boss in the game.<br /><br />As other posters have said, Ikky will easily solo it. The whole thing is so underwhelming that I do legitimately wonder if it is not intended to be this easy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nofarian</b></h3>Not sure if already posted before here, but:<br /><br />Jade Owl DECIMATES Jawbone, every time.<br />The way Jawbones works is this:<br />-He will first apply his spiked shield, then Whirlpool, then bite. These are all aquatic damage and weak to your magic-element owl.<br />Simply use Slicing Winds twice (one for Spiked Shield, one for Whirlpool), use Hawk Eye, and then use Lift-Off (Which will dodge the Whirlpool finally going off). if Jawbone isn't dead, simply finish him off with slicing winds.<br /><br />And Jade Owl has not dropped below 50% HP.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zarilla</b></h3>Thank you, Everyone! As usual all the advice here is pretty on target.<br /><br />I was able to use my Jade Owl and Anubisath Idol. In the third slot I put the a second Mechatula that I am leveling up. With the first two or any of the of the others that people recommend, this is the perfect pet battle to level a pet in your third spot. Even though my Mechatula is was only 21 and died he still got difficulty bonus and leveled up. I want two of those super pets since they have done so well for me in the past. <br /><br />Now if I could only get a sound strategy for Kostos I would have beaten all of the pet battles in Bastion. I just can't seem to get him right now matter how many pets I use to counteract his healing process.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Auralie</b></h3>Direbeak Hatchling can solo, 1,2,1 for abilities. Ironskin, Falcosaur Swarm, Predatory Strike, Pass (or swap in/out leveling pet), Ironskin, Falcosaur Swarm, Predatory Strike.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LaffiBoozegnome</b></h3><b>Jawbone</b> <i>(Beast Team)</i><br />Zandalari Anklerender (2,1,2)<br /><br /><b>Jawbone</b> <i>(Flying Team)</i><br />Ikky (x,1,1)<br /><br />Comment: Tried very quick these two pets to see if it was that simple, and it was. Both Zandalari Anklerender and Ikky dies in the end though.<br />P.S. Jawbone is not part of the meta achievement, but at least simple to do if you're doing the World Quest.</div>
