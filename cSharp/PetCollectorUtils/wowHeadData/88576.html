Things like the Tiny Twister are linked, and whenever a catchable pet pops in Arathi, it has a chance to go to the Circle of Outer Binding and become a Tiny Twister.\r\n\r\nSecondly, killing critter versions can open slots for pokemon to spawn into. The reason this often does not work (and the reason for the massive confusion) is that the zone is entirely full of pokemon. No more will spawn. Every time you open a Sporebat slot by killing a Sporebat critter, it will come back as a critter again, because it must.\r\n\r\nThe only antidote to this is battling pokemon throughout the zone. This won't get you any Sporebats personally, since the zone is presently so crowded.

Has anyone else been able to catch them?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>674353</b></h3>Either they're bugged, or you have to force a spawn by killing critters because I don't see a single one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BenT90</b></h3>I think this is a time of day thing. I'm going to test it out tonight. I had a problem looking for the Brilliant Bloodfeathers last night, but this morning they were everywhere. So I'm guessing maybe because they're called &quot;shadow Sporebats&quot; they want the dark. If they're like the restless spirits from Deadwind Pass then I bet you can start pet Battling around midnight server time. I'll update this is my theory is right.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>marclar</b></h3>I found only one on Kazzak-EU and it was on a cliff that I could only reach by jumping from the first cliff where you get ported to Khadgar, dying and soulstone ressurecting.on it. I'm not sure but I think it was after midnight.<br /><br />Girlfriend found one also at 4:00 in the morning. So i'm gonna backup the Nighttime theory.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aliandrin</b></h3>Many of these rare uniques work in the same way.<br /><br />First, only the Minfernal is absolutely not linked with other pokemon in the zone. Things like the Tiny Twister are linked, and whenever a catchable pet pops in Arathi, it has a chance to go to the Circle of Outer Binding and become a Tiny Twister.<br /><br />Secondly, killing critter versions can open slots for pokemon to spawn into. The reason this often does not work (and the reason for the massive confusion) is that the zone is entirely full of pokemon. No more will spawn. Every time you open a Sporebat slot by killing a Sporebat critter, it will come back as a critter again, because it must.<br /><br />The only antidote to this is battling pokemon throughout the zone. This won't get you any Sporebats personally, since the zone is presently so crowded. People passing through will snatch up the Sporebats you worked hard to create (and it does require hard work as Draenor pokemon are all unable to be attacked and must be battled in order to get rid of them).<br /><br />If you don't have a friend that can team with you (they battle in other areas of the zone and you camp Sporebats, then switch off when you get one) then you're just going to have to wait until the expansion dies down and no one is in Talador. Then, you can battle throughout the zone and come back to harvest your Sporebats.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ainnir</b></h3>Went by several times throughout the night, none were up. Logged back in right after a server restart and found 9 of them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PandaSpirit</b></h3>Found mine at 2:15 PM server time. (1:15 Mountain time..)<br />I stayed up late the past couple of nights waiting for it to spawn after reading the previous comments.<br /><br />I think maybe it's just a rare spawn. Or I'm just lucky haha.<br /><br />-Found another after making this post. It spawned within 10 minutes of me finding the other one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sugarbaby</b></h3>I caught mine at 3:38pm server time. So if they do spawn at night they certainly don't despawn during the day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>slybootz</b></h3>Caught mine at ~5pm on US-Anvilmar, it was poor quality but I didn't care. Saw 3-4 of them up, got in combat with another to save it for a guildie to get it, and he got the common quality one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>KilerSquirel123</b></h3>Ok so I got to the spawn at about 1:00am server time, <u>no spawns</u> cant remember if it was raining at that point. Went away and caught the crab that spawns in Talador aswell, came back at 1:10am server time.<br /><br />This time it was raining all over the place,<u> no spawns</u>. Stayed awhile and killed everything in the area. <u>No spawns</u>. Went away to catch the second to last pet I had left. <br />Came back at 1:30ish am server time. Still raining, <u>no spawn</u>. <br /><br />1:50am server time, stopped raining, ive now tried to /pet all the Sporebats around, tried killing just the sporebats, tried killing only the snails, tried killing just mobs and no critters. <u>No spawns</u>.<br /><br />I've now run around just looking for spawns, nothing. The time is now 2:45am server time. <br />Been standing still for awhile aswell. <br /><br />I've kinda <b>debunked</b> both that they spawn during the rain and during the dark as comments listed above or I'm just really unlucky. I'm thinking they are just rare spawns.<br />I'll now go do some dailys in 10 mins and come back to check if any spawns. If not I'll try again later today.<br /><br />I will not stop hunting until that pet and achievment is mine!<br /><br /><u>Edit<b></u><br /><br />Stopped by at 3:33am server time as I was omw to Assault on Shatt daily. <u>No spawn</u>.<br /><br />Finnished Shatt daily, came back at 4:10am server time and saw the paw</b> on minimap, had a mini heartattack, nope Silkbead Snail... But it's the first pet battle I've been able to have in the correct zone so progress!<br />It has also started raining again.<br /><br />4:31am server time, calling it a night, still raining <u>no spawn</u>.<br /><br />Checked again after work at about 5:50pm server time, <u>no spawn</u><br />Came back again at 7:00pm it's raining again but still <u>no spawns</u>. Some other people running around questing / gathering stuff.<br /><br />After camping from 7:00pm to about 8:00pm server time by just running around the place I saw the <b>green paw</b> again! This time it was a <b>sporebat!<i></i></b> It spawned up at the tower not down in the canyon so was abit suprised. <br />I rushed up there as fast as I could and it was flying around the &quot;pond&quot; in the middle near the tower. <br /><br />I was extremely lucky and it was a rare one! It had a Waterfly and a Silkbead Snail as backup pets.<br />Caught it and got my achievment and sporebat! <br />It was raining at the time it spawned but I dont know if it had anything to do with it spawning as it rained several times during my camp.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1407805</b></h3>I just caught one on Runetotem server at 7:55PM realm time. It was in a cave North West of the portal on Khadgar's Tower side.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JasminesDragon</b></h3>9:33pm server time (Shadowsong), raining. Only one spawned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cassiadawn</b></h3>I just visited Zangarra, no battle pets of any sort up. It was, however, raining. I killed about 5 non-combat shadow sporebats, and about 20 seconds later both a combat shadow sporebat and a combat silkbead snail spawned, in places where I'd just killed the non combat sporebats. <br /><br />So, I suspect they may have a chance to spawn only when it's raining, AND only when their &quot;spot&quot; isn't already filled by a non-combat critter.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Azshes</b></h3>I was just in Zangarra (Lothar est 630am) around 82:29 it <u>is</u> raining and the only battle pet up was a Shadow Sporebat, accompanied by a silkbead snail and a red-tailed chipmunk.<br /><br />I <u>did not </u>kill any non combat anything and there were no other players in the immediate area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ashleydsumner</b></h3>I spent a couple hours (after 11pm to after 1am server/Arygos) waiting for one of these guys to spawn. I ran up and down the path, killing every critter snail and sporebat <i>just in case</i> it would help. <br /><br />Around 12:55am, it began to rain and because of the comments here, I was more hopeful. I gave up around 1:15, but logged out in the area. <br /><br />Today, I logged back in at 12:15pm server time and it was raining! There was a BP snail and sporebat! I snagged him up, even though he's poor quality. As I ran out, there was another BP in the cave at 81, 29. I sent out a message on Gen Chat, hopefully someone else can grab him for the achievement!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Anistasia</b></h3>I camped this bastard all day today with no luck. I tried killing all critter spawns; no luck.<br />So far, I've seen ONE paw on my map and it was a snail.<br /><br />Hang in there! This can be a long camp, guys. I'll update my post when I actually capture one.<br /><br />One suggestion: bring a follower with you with whom you need faction. There are tons of easy-to-kill little guys in the area that give 10 faction per kill. I leveled up my follower while I camped.<br /><br />EDIT: This morning I logged in after camping all day yesterday, and there were two paws on my map. One was a snail, and one was a Sporebat. He was Poor quality, but I don't care! I captured him at 12:45 PM server time.<br /><br />In total yesterday, I saw 3 paws all day - 3 snails; one that I killed outright and 2 that I battled to see if it would encourage a spawn. My only conclusion is that you can do nothing about this spawn except sit and wait. Check back frequently, be patient, and you'll get your achievement. Good luck everyone! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>valepu</b></h3>I camped this pet from 4.45 AM to 8.30 AM and not a single battle pet spawned (during this period it rained by time to time), i have even changed server by time to time (joining apexis daily raids and leaving after checking the area). <br /><br />There was a single Snail when i arrived but after winning that no other battle pet spawned, neither snail or sporebat. This has happened other 4 times, to find a single snail as the only battle pet in the area (twice today, when i arrived in the area and when i went to another server).<br /><br />I kept running around the area but the 2 main places (where most of the sporebats are) i checked were <br />1) the area between No'losh and the Assassin's cove <br />2) Khadgar's Tower<br />In the first area i kept killing every sporebat that spawned, in the 2nd i spared them.<br /><br />I think it's safe to rule out time of the day and weather (i believe people say it' linked to the weather because it rains quite often in Zangarra), but i wonder how long is the respawn timer and why the snails are on a long timer too...<br /><br />EDIT: Just got one (B/B sadly) at 4:15 PM server time, this time i wasn't actively looking...actually i had just logged in and saw the green paw on the map, in the area between No'losh and the Assassin's cove. Once again there was only 1 battle pet in the whole area and i'm starting to think the spawn time is around 12 hours</div>

It was of poor quality, but it gave me the achievement!<br /><br />I don't think there is a certain time that it spawns. I just think it depends on how many people are out there looking for it or doing pet battles. If it is in the wee hours of the morning, there will be fewer people around to go after it.<br /><br />Seeing that it is a smaller area that it spawns, of course there will be fewer spawns.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Juiceifer</b></h3>This is basically <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62317/minfernal">Minfernal 2.0</a> and as such I would not recommend camping this pet. Instead, park an alt out by the Zangarra flight path and log onto it whenever you don't have anything better to do. Hit the portal and while you're flying across the ravine, keep an eye out for any pet spawns. With any luck, the pet you finally encounter won't be the dreaded <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63001/silkbead-snail">Herald of Disappointment</a>. Doing this sporadically for a few days, I was able to catch this pet with minimal effort despite playing on one of the busier servers.<br /><br />If you care about the quality of your battle pets, don't push your luck hoping for a rare version right away; frankly, you don't stand a shadow of a chance. While you could keep checking in for another, this is one of those situations where I would not bat an eye using a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=92677/flawless-flying-battle-stone">stone</a> on whatever one you do manage to catch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1048480</b></h3>Found a common B/B at 1:30 pm server time. It was raining. I had been killing critters. No clue if either of these last two have any bearing on spawns for this guy--just adding to the data.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Volleynova</b></h3>Got mine at 86, 28, literally a few minutes after zoning in, it is off the grid, far below, and away from most player traffic. I was able to see it during the daytime, precisely 1PM Central.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1406132</b></h3>Caught a poor quality Shadow Sporebat at 8.11pm (server time) on Turalyon EU. I had camped this guy for two days and got nothing, then logged on this evening and there he was.<br /><br />I would agree with others that this is a rare spawn and killing creatures and the type of weather have no effect as I spent a whole day killing the creatures during the rain and got nothing.<br /><br />One little tip; if you are camping make sure to take the portal over to Khadgar's Tower as the green pet paws dont seem to show up on the map if you are quickly logging in whilst near the Zangara flight path.<br /><br />Good luck and happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kiyosue</b></h3>Not too sure about the whole time of day thing. I've been looking for this for a couple weeks now, on and off. I've tried going after midnight, anywhere from 0:00-3:00 and didn't see any. I'd fly there at random times during the afternoon and also hadn't seen one. Today I flew there to turn in the legendary quest, and one was floating right on the platform after you take the portal to reach the platform where Khadgar is (84,31). Time was 12:38 EST, on the Stormrage server. Checked the surrounding areas for anymore but there weren't any. Good luck.<br /><br />Edit: All 3 pets on the team were flying, defeated them all with a rare 25 Anubisath Idol 1/2/1.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>thebl4ckd0g</b></h3>quite possibly the hardest battle pet to find on draenor. capture the first one you fight, b/c you may not see another one for a while.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1061134</b></h3>Got mine at 14:55 server time. <br />Unlike previous time, when I saw this little creature and an alliance stole it while I was battling the mobs around it, it had spawned in a place not reachable just passing by, but on the second level (from ground) of waterfall at 80.89, 27.68. Having almost got a digital heart attack of happiness noticing the green paw that was not snail on the map, I returned to Zangara as fast as I could and jumped down the waterfall level by level. <br />Got it of poor quality, but now I know where will my tomorrow's pet daily's battle-stone go. :)</div>

It's a small ledge on the wall, so I had to jump down alongside the mountain. <br /><br />It's 01:05 in the morning and raining lightly, though I think it just started.<br /><br />Man, I was so anxious when I found it, because I had to move back to Khadgar's place to take the whisp-transfer-thingy to the other side, and I worried someone might steal *my* pet, lol.<br /><br />Good thing I'm on my druid, as getting down the side took quite a bit of HP.<br /><br />The pet is gray and was the last I needed for Draenor :)<br /><br />Funny, I actually, just found my second <a href="/npc=71163/unborn-valkyr">Unborn Val'kyr</a> on my other char just before I found this - I feel crazy lucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>matoh</b></h3>It is not that hard to get, all you need is to use premade finder like your life depends on it, to hop into other servers to check whether this little critter is there.<br /><br />I got mine that way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Crystore</b></h3>Finally managed to catch one. It was H/H breed green one. 12:15 am server time and it was raining. (81.99, 29,09 talador).<br /><br />Edit: Added location</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>123325</b></h3>Today I tried the server-hopping trick, and was a bit confused how it worked and where to go, so I'll share what worked for me! I joined random, custom groups, usually filled with people sitting in their garrisons. It took me about 15 server tries before I found it. The trick is to wait a few seconds to ensure you changed servers. Usually small mobs or critters will fade out then back in. I bounced back and forth from ledge to ledge with the portal, which flew me over the zone to check as well. When I did find it, I saw it as I flew over, and it was down on the ground with the mobs walking around. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maxeek</b></h3>Got this one today. Waited for realm restart, cleared the whole area just before servers went down, and after they came back there were like 6 of them spawned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lyariana</b></h3>Confirmed - realm hopping is the best way of doing this. I got mine at 6.35pm server time, just in front of where the rare spawns.<br /><br />It took me over 30 server hops, but eventually got it on Mal'Ganis. There were 2 Sporebats and 1 Silkbread Snail up. My sporebat was grey. No idea about the other - someone else got it before I could check.<br /><br />Finally - the hunt is over!<br /><br />On a side note - watch out for gankers when you're realm hopping. I got murdered twice while jumping servers.. they know we're coming to steal their pets!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Krowi</b></h3>From my experience, these guys share a spawn cap with the snails in the same area. Killing the snails in a pet battle and leaving it will remove them from the world and open a spot for either another snail or a sporebat to spawn.<br /><br />I've done this for over an hour and fought about 20 sporebats. None of them were rare though.</div>
