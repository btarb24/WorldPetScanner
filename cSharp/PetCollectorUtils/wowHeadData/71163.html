Use a critter to weaken her faster.[\/li]\n[li]She brings two other pets to the battle & they are either Critters, Beasts or Aquatics, depending on the zone you are in. [\/li]\n[li]She spawns in all qualities[\/li]\n[li]She can now fly thanks to the latest hotfix[\/li]\n[li]Her known breeds are: B\/B, H\/H.[\/li][\/ul]\n[ul][li]She has two 'death' abilities which are [petability=652] & [petability=321] [\/li][\/ul]\nThese two abilities are often confused when trying to capture her. Both spells cause the Val'kyr to die, UA is a perma death while Haunt is not. From my understanding UA was [url=https:\/\/twitter.com\/mumper\/status\/335500554996424704]hot[\/url][url=https:\/\/twitter.com\/mumper\/status\/340606218873757697]fixed[\/url] so she wouldn't cast it as often in the wild (as this makes it impossible to tame her) while Haunt is what a lot of players are seeing in battle. Unfortunately if you get the one which casts UA you will need to keep hunting for a new one. The issue with Haunt is it's still hit or miss so she can end up perma dead anyway! If Haunt misses or if your pet which Haunt was applied on dies the round Haunt is due to drop off your Val'kyr [u]will remain dead[\/u]. To save yourself this heartache I recommend using a pet which has a heal ability so you can try to keep it close to full HP until haunt goes off. Also it's worth the risk having a high hitting pet in your team in case you do get a val'kyr with UA ability as it gives you a chance to knock her down quick and trap before she casts UA.\n[i]**Please note if you DC, forfeit or lose the battle while she is in this dead state she will not respawn for you. If you forfeit the fight while she is alive she will respawn as any wild battle pet would. Also during PvP pet combat I've found Haunt appears to miss more then hit which in some fights will cost you a win, just FYI.**[\/i]\n\n[u]VIDEO[\/u]\nThis pet resurrects critters from death!

This was reported back in PTR and in live I have never seen more than one up.[\/li]\n[li]I have never seen her up in two different spots at once, however, after a successful capture she tends to spawn faster then a failed capture. I only write this because after some guildies caught theirs she did pop up fairly fast 30min-2hrs, however after one reported a failed attempt we could not find one under the 2hr mark. This is just early on observations so take it with a grain of salt.**ok update on this: was on my low pop server and she was up in two spots at once, flew over her in Loque's spot in Sholazar and then in court of bones Icecrown. I doubt someone had captured her between the time I flew past one & got to the other so it's likely she was up at the same time. Thought I'd share that.**[\/li] \n[li]As for timers, right now, it's too soon to tell. I had it at 6hrs but there are a whole bunch of new discovered spawn locations I never saw in PTR & mumper did say it wasn't as elusive as the Minfernal so it's likely she is popping up all over the place![\/li]\n[li]For those without co-ords head over to user Nalain 's post, they have got visual pin-points on maps. Clever post.[\/li]\n[\/ul]\n\nAny hot tips?\nIf you're just having bad luck finding her park some alts over some spots and just check in every now and then - I've marked the safe spots to park your low lvl alts.

I was about to go to bed and gave it one last look.\n\nFirst of all, I will confirm that NPCscan [b]does[\/b] work, as it triggered when I reached that spot in Grizzly Hills.  However, I did get a few false alerts even when standing still, and of course if you open your pet journal, it will very likely trigger, even when I had 'not collected' turned off for me.\n\nI did not kill anything, I did not fight any other pets in the area, I simply happened to be flying toward Dun Argol since others talked about it (I didn't even know the coordinates, just that it was NE of Dun Argol), and it was there when I arrived.  I never saw anyone else around before, during, or after the battle.\n\nAlso, [b]the spawn time is apparently not that long, potentially as little as only an hour or so[\/b].  One person who saw me in Zul'Drak added me to their friends list while I was raiding\/camping a spot in ZD on my alt, and told me about an hour before I caught mine that they caught one in Borean Tundra (and I did check their Armory profile to make sure they weren't kidding about getting it).  I finished raiding early and they messaged me around 11:20-30pm server time, and I got mine at around 12:40am.\n\nI started off at Zul'Drak in the middle, and worked my way down to Grizzly Hills since so many people seemed to have good luck there.  When NPCscan went off, at first I was nervous since the paw icon disappeared from my mini-map before I hovered over it, and I thought it was another false alarm or that someone else happened to grab it before me, but then it refreshed and appeared.  Phew!\n\nThe fight was fairly easy for me.  I only \"needed\" two level 25 pets, a Bandicoon Kit (used Tongue Lash twice which luckily hit enough times to bring it just under 35%, took 4 attempts to catch it) and a Nether Faerie Dragon.  The Val'kyr came first (common rarity), and after I caged it, my Bandicoon was down to about 35% health.  I was able to get the second pet down to 20% or so, and even though I still had Survival, I decided to swap out to the Nether Faerie Dragon, which finished off the second pet and third without taking much damage at all.\n\nThe other two pets were just normal common woodland creatures, nothing difficult.  The Val'kyr never suicided on me, maybe because it was still near 30% health it didn't find it necessary.\n\nGood luck to everyone!  It's a great looking pet, and I've been hearing of more people getting it than I thought, especially since it just came out, so hopefully it's not *that* rare (or maybe I'm just disillusioned since I'm usually really unlucky with things like this).","date":"2013-05-23T00:04:35-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2013-05-23T00:17:20-05:00",4,"Forumchibi"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":69,"id":1856257,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"gummiebear007","body":"I finally caught mine at the location in ZD on the North side of the road where the giant mob pats.

From what I've seen, it really [i]appears[\/i] to be random; some spawn on or next to roads, others in the middle of zones or on ridges. Some spawns are exactly on other battle pet spawns (via map addons like Pet Tracker). I decided the best strategy would be to just fly around and cover literally every inch of every zone.

In fact, I flew past a few of the recorded coords, and each one had 2-5 people just sitting and waiting for who knows how long. Check in on known spawn locations while doing a flythrough, but I highly suggest NOT camping them.

I started out flying between all of the spawn points repeatedly, switched to camping a few times, but the one thing that was effective for me was this:\r\n\r\n1. Park 3 of your toons at each of the 3 spawn points in a particular zone. (I put 3 of my toons at each point in Borean Tundra.)\r\n2. Cycle between the 3 toons until one spawns. A friend of mine caught one exactly on the hour at the Northern Borean tundra spawn point. So I decided to check on the hour as well. At 4am I checked all 3 spawn points and there was a Val'kyr up at one of them. The point it chooses to spawn at out of the 3 is completely random. It CAN be the same one twice in a row. Or it may not be. \r\n\r\n[b]It can possibly be deduced that every hour, on the hour, an Unborn Val'kyr spawns at 1 of the 3 points in each Northrend zone. By having a toon on each spawn point in one zone, you should theoretically be able to capture one within 1 hour.[\/b]\r\n\r\nIf you have been spending many hours trying to get a Val'kyr, please try this strategy and see if it works for you. You can also recruit to friends to sit at the spawn points for you if you don't have 3 alts for it or you're on a server where you wouldn't have enough time to swap toons. \r\n\r\nGood luck!","date":"2013-05-25T03:30:04-05:00","rating":-5,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"That's a good idea.

We thought of this idea by ourselves however others may have already done so and posted it.\n\nThe idea is to find the deadest realm on your region, so for example Earthen Ring EU is a dead role playing realm. What we did was one of us would make a Lvl 1 character on Earthen Ring, the other would fly with a two seater to the human starting zone (or orc for horde) and pick them up. We would then fly to the stormwind docks (orgrimmar zepplins) and take the transport to Northrend. \n\nFrom this point you can decide your route. Once hovering above a spawning point, simply tell your partner to jump off your mount. Then the lvl 90 kicks the lvl 1 from the group. This makes them phase back into their own dead realm. It took us about 1h of searching the individual spawn points to find two of these pets, one for each of us. The bulk of the time spent will be rezzing your level 1 character.\n\nOnce the lvl 1 character has the pet, log out and log onto your lvl 90 and repeat the process for your taxi driver friend.\n\nThings to note:\n\n- If a pet is underneath or very close to a mob, keep rezzing closer and closer to it. If you enter a pet battle with it the mob will deaggro you and you can capture it, then die and get invited back to the safe realm.\n- Some areas such as south east Icecrown are heavily phased. This will mean your lvl 1 will have to run south and jump off the dam into crystalsong forest to dephase.\n- We did this between 3 AM and 4 AM to greatly increase our chances of finding a pet.\n\nThe map we used was posted in these comments, i cannot link to it because my account is new. Imgur \/ xaCRdtq is the site and image code though.\n\nGood luck and happy hunting :)\n\n- Leeches and Purple","date":"2013-05-30T09:25:02-05:00","rating":36,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"JUST confirmed that this plan actually worked!

I thought I would leave a comment illustrating my method and time commitment.\r\n\r\n1) If you really want this pet, make sure you have NPCScan and Tom-Tom\r\n2) Don't Camp a particular spawn\r\n3) Add the valk to your NPCScan, and create the 3 marcos listed above for Tom-Tom\r\n4) Dont kill yourself farming this.\r\n\r\nI lost the first spawn, (wasn't looking for this pet at all, just filling out the Northrend collection achievement) I saw in Zul Drak ( by the big path) because I was not ready with a strong enough pet team.  I boxed her, killed one pet and then got finished off by a poor quality squirrel (it was close...)  After this rage worthy defeat  I gave up for a while and would only occasionally poke around Northrend hoping the RNG god would hook me up with a spawn right outside of Dalaran.  After the initial rage wore off I began camping the spawn I first saw her at, because....well why not...This was utterly unfruitful.\r\n\r\nSo I decided to take what appears to have been a pro tip, and configured Tom Tom and NPCScan with the appropriate information.  3 passes around Northrend, about 20 minutes a piece...nothing, and then ! NPCScan goes off and I quickly dropped down and captured a poor quality, which I immediately stoned to rare :)\r\n\r\nMy one piece of information which I haven seen here yet is to ensure that you have track target on.  When NPCscan went off, there were several battle pets on the mini map but luckily I had track target on, so I clicked the NPCScan alert box to target her and know which of the pets was her, flew down and tagged her.  Quite literally 3 other players dropped from the sky and attempted to grab her as well.  I think if I would have had to mouse-over the mini map to see which pet there was the Valk, I would have surely lost her.  \r\n\r\nI know this information is near worthless to someone seeking the pet, but I think the tips I took from here really allowed me to cut a lot of farming time off.

As a result, I do the Chilmaw quest almost every day and am always checking to see if an Unborn Val'kyr is up in that area since it has a spawn point there.\r\n\r\nWell, today for the first time in like 4 months of looking, I swept in not even really thinking about whether one would be up, I just gave up hope long ago, and just started in on Chillmaw.

I found that setting up multiple alts, each at a different spawn point was the easiest way of finding her. I would randomly check each spawn point about once an hour or so. Some tips to catching her.\n\nIf she has Unholy ascension as her third move she can (and usually will commit suicide). You can counter this by leaving battle, and re-engaging her. As long as you don't attack, she will respawn. If you have killed a pet, or one of yours has died then it will not, so be sure to check which move she has before fighting her.\n\nTerrible Turnip is your friend. Once you got her with Haunt, you will want to knock her down to low health quickly, and not kill her. With its self healing it can also take a pounding while you wait for the Haunt to end (if she used it).\n\nAny pet with death grip will be useful as well. When Haunt ends she returns to the back row. You can then Death grip her back out and try to catch her once more. **Note** If she uses Haunt and she is the last remaining pet the battle will automatically end. Try to leave at least one pet alive on the other side.\n\nHope this helps, and good luck everyone.","date":"2014-03-22T03:28:18-05:00","rating":9,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2014-03-24T01:12:57-05:00",3,"499650"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":368,"id":1953704,"nreplies":3,"sticky":0,"user":"Damonra","body":"Do they spawn underground?

Unfortunately, the Haunt\/Unholy Ascension ability was not something I understood the first time I encountered her, and I lost the first pet because she killed herself. \n\nIt is important to note that because of you all, when I encountered the second pet after further hours of searching, I knew what to do. Some of the following is paraphrasing what others have said, but it is important and bears repeating.\n\n[b][u]I recommend using an aquatic pet of at least level 23 with a self-heal ability to battle the Unborn Valkyr.[\/u][\/b] If she haunts your pet, you need to stay alive for 4 rounds, and that self-heal ability can make the difference on whether or not you capture her. Ironically, she also spawned (the second time) with a blue rare Squirrel as well, so [b]having a beast or mech to handle Critters is a good idea for your 2nd\/3rd battle slots.[u][\/u][\/b]\n\nAfter days of searching, when I finally encountered the second Valkyr, as much as my sweaty-palmed, heart-pounding state wanted to leap in and immediately battle\/capture the second pet I encountered, I didn't.

Back and forth I went three times until finally she switched her third ability to Haunt. Phew! I locked in the battle and captured her.\n\nI don't know if this information will help anyone, but the first pet I encountered was just south of Skorn in Howling Fjord; she was grey, and it was early morning, 6 AM. The second pet was in the northern Stormwright Shelf area of Sholozar Basin; she was green, and it was night, 9 PM. These encounters were six days apart. Neither appeared after a server restart or anything special. Dogged determination and a little piece of knowledge about checking her third ability will increase your odds of success.

Looking for the easiest path to 25, I followed a guide which lead my to Dragonblight to catch birds. As it so happens I stumbled upon a Unborn Val'kyr in the northern part of the zone. I had heard they were rare, but I wasn't in a position to attempt a catch, and after reading the struggles on Wowhead about catching I'm glad I left it.\n\nFlash forward a few days later, I'm working at getting pets rounded up for the Celestial Tournament and Beasts of Fable after having trounced the tamers of Azeroth and Pandaria. After some research into one fight it was suggested to have, you guessed it and Unbork Val'kyr. Now disappointed in myself for not even attempting a catch I added it to the bottom of my growing list of needed pets. I soon reached the end of that list and made my way around Borean(Nothing), Scholazar(Nada), Icecrown(Nope), Storm Peaks(Sigh...), and finally Zul'Drak.\n\nWhat's this I see at the Alter of Rhunok? An Unborn Val'kyr. I quickly pounce, not wanting to lose my opportunity to cross realm trickery. Knowing the horror stories of Unholy Ascension, I quickly glanced at my targets abilities. HAUNT! I swung first with my Tolai Hare's flurry, doing a nice chunk of critter damage. Not wanting to overdo it, I swapped to a level 8 Terrible Turnip to pass a little more damage with Weakening Blow before it was dispatched. I swapped into an Eternal Strider, and jetted the Val'kyr with two cold blasts from Water Jet to bring it down to capture territory. I throw. I miss. I throw again, begging to gods for some bit of luck... IT LANDS!\n\nOk, so I'm elated, but now to deal with the not one but two rare Arctic Hare's accompanying my prize. I managed to handle them with easy and now here sits my beautiful, prized, Poor quality B\/B Unborn Val'kyr. Thankfully I have an Undead Battle-Stone in my bags.\n\nEdit:\nSo I wrote this while I continued to fly from zone to zone, to the remaining spawn points I hadn't hit, just for ^&*!s and giggles. I get to my very last spot north of Baelgun's Excavation Site in Howling Fjord and there floats another Val'kyr. I engage once again with the same team as before, this time she is a beautiful Rare B\/B with Unholy Ascension. Thank you to all the comments that pointed out to forfeit and then try for Haunt, because it worked first go. I popped flurry twice from my Hare, threw three time before the Val'kyr was captured. Then I faced off against a Rare(I know right) Turkey, who finished my rabbit and nearly got my Strider. Fortunately, my Strider held on cooking that jive Turkey, and squashing the Poor Maggot that followed. Gotta say I'm pretty thrilled right now.","date":"2014-07-15T05:58:41-05:00","rating":-3,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2014-07-15T06:10:18-05:00",1,"Gracin"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":397,"id":1981253,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"relictor","body":"My search started yesterday.

Slightly annoyed, I stopped for the day.\r\n\r\nToday I hopped on at midday to continue my search. I literally went to every coordinate bar one in Zul'Drak, I flew to it without much hope. I became erect with happiness as I saw her icon light up on my minimap - I engaged! I made sure this time to look at her skills, to find she had unholy ascension in her skill list.

Just stumbled across her 'Oh, another un-captured pet, better grab it' \n\nLately I've decided I want three of them, so last night I went out and caught two more.\n\nJust wanted to note a few things that might help those trying to catch her.\n\n- These pets spawn relatively quickly compared to what you would expect. I accidentally killed one last night, and caught two others and did a dungeon within an hour and a half.\n\n- As others specified, she seemly can only be active at one spot at once. Fly all over northrend, she'll probably be at one of the spawns. If you somehow check every spot, likely she was killed just before you started, check the full route again and you'll find her.\n\n- Running from the fight, and re-engaging WILL change her move-set. Basically, hover over her picture, if shes has the ability 'Unholy Ascension' she's suicidal, and you need to immediately leave that fight. Re-engage her until she has haunt instead.\n\n- Do NOT flee when she is dead from haunt, or she will not respawn.\n\n- Try to capture her before she haunts you, and do not let her be the last pet alive, as haunt will then be a suicide and end the battle.\n\n- Mind your crits, do not use an ability that hits '300-400' if she has 585 HP, you could end up losing her.\n\nIf shes in the back row, or you're worried she might die if you hit her, just flee and re-engage so shes fully healed. Just be sure you check for 'Unholy Ascension' again if you do.

Had been looking for several weeks for my Unborn Val'kyr using the maps given here, but was beginning to be discouraged. Do not give up, you will find one eventually. I stuck to the spawn points listed on wowhead. I found mine in Howling Fjord @ 68.1, 67.8 coordinates at 11:30 am CST.  I was on Illidan-US server, not sure if that matters because of cross-realm.  I was also using a pet addon called Cancel Pet Fight in case she had unholy ascension ability first, just in case.  The other two pets she had with her were a common rat and a turkey.  I used 3 lvl 25 rares, darkmoon rabbit H\/S, Strand Crawler H\/H, and a Mirror Strider H\/B, just in case I had to heal.  Rabbit got her low enough quickly and easily to be caged, and she did not cast haunt, took four attempts to cage despite pristine trap.  Turkey took the longest to kill due to aquatic pets.  I thought maybe this might help someone. It also helped to have your pet team \"ready\" before hand so you don't kill her by accident or your pets get owned by her and her team.  I used a pet team addon called PetBattle Teams, which lets you set up different teams ahead of time.  This really helped me to be prepared when I did find her.  I also had 3 characters in Northrend, covering a few zones, instead of flying one all over, so I just alternated checking their zones\/spawn points, then if nothing, I'd switch to another one again.

The first realm I hopped to didn't have a snowstorm so I left the group and as I did I saw an Unborn Val'kyr flying right in front of me but then it phased out.

He was AFK!  I clicked on the Val'kyr and engaged battle and noticed she had the suicide ability.  In a panic I quickly left the battle and noticed the other player was dismounted watching me ready to steal the pet.  I was able to click on it again and once again suicide ability!  UGH!  So I gave it a good 30 seconds to throw off the other player, left battle, reengaged and haunt!  \n\nIt was a close battle as I didn't have the best team built for it but I was able to capture a grey one!

I got my third Unborn Val'kyr today in Storm Peaks near the Horde Camp Tunkalo.  I got the first a few days ago in Sholazar near River's Heart and the second one the day after that in Borean Tundra near Bor'gorok Outpost.  The first one was at 7:00 AM eastern on Friday.  The second one was at 3:00 AM eastern on Saturday.  The third was at around 10:30 AM eastern on Wednesday.  Each of the three was done on a different toon.  Two were rogues and the third was on a warrior; I don't play any of those three very much.  They're basically profession toons.\n\nThe only advice I can give you is to look for her at times when no one else is looking.  I know, that may be difficult, especially on high population servers.  I have enough toons that are 90+ that I can put one in each zone but that didn't necessarily help me, especially with the third one.  I have a few 90+ toons on a low population server and when I seemed to encounter a camper at many different spawn points no matter what time it was on the high population server, I moved to the low population server, flew around to every spawn point.  \n\nAlmost the very last point, the one near Camp Tunkalo was where I found her.  I only had one left to check.  So, the point is that no one was out looking for her on the low population server and I was free to check every single one without competition.  The first two were on my main server which is high population and it may have been my insane pure luck that I got two but I favor early morning and it works.  Good luck and take comfort in knowing that you won't have me to compete with for her now.","date":"2015-04-01T10:16:46-05:00","rating":-1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2015-04-01T10:19:54-05:00",2,"Biffsterr"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":462,"id":2152040,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"flig999","body":"if you can get this pet out with a [npc=36979] and next to a critter you can watch as the critter frozen and revived over and over again. =)","date":"2015-04-02T22:57:00-05:00","rating":-1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":463,"id":2153783,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Mandrax","body":"I picked one of these up last night, the location just north-east of Valkyrion in Storm Peaks.

I wanted the cockroach's Apocalypse ability just in case the fight was a long one, but it was never used.\n\nAt the spawn point between Unu'pe and Death's Stand I checked a green-paw print and it was a wild Unborn Val'kyr, spoiling for a fight.

This killed the Unborn Val'kyr, and after she performed her rebirth with minimum health, I was able to capture her on the first use of the trap.  The other two pets were quickly killed (I think they were a rat and a crab) and I breathed a huge sigh of relief.\n\nCome to a fight prepared, and you will usually win, but pure,dumb luck is always helpful.

In this case Unborn Val'kyr. Before you kill it, just make sure the battle pet you are trying to catch can't be one of the two pets that can join the fight (ie 2:nd and 3:rd pet that joins the pet battle).\r\n\r\nI usually initiate a pet battle and check what battle pets are present and just forfeit the battle if none of the pets are to my liking or I need to heal up before the real fight. Unless you kill or catch one of the pets, you can always forfeit the battle, heal up again and then rejoin the battle and the same pets will still be there. Doing it like this usually speeds up the search for the specific battle pets you want unless you just want to fight for the XP. \r\n\r\nPersonally I don't care about the quality of the battle pets since you can always use a [url=https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/item=92741\/flawless-battle-stone]Flawless Battle-Stone[\/url] (or the family specific ones) to upgrade the battle pets to rare quality. Flawless Battle-Stones are easy to get doing World Quests or just by buying them with [url=https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/item=163036\/polished-pet-charm]Polished Pet Charms[\/url].","date":"2024-03-15T09:00:21-05:00","rating":2,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":false,"ptr2":false,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":625,"id":5801260,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"in2it","body":"I just wanted you to know that I caught a Unborn Val'kyr (B\/B) in Grizzly Hills today.\r\n\r\nI play on European servers, in this case Earthen Ring (RP server). I started the fight at 13:18 server time (CET, 1:18 pm). The Unborn Val'kyr was level 21 and as I said BB breed. \r\n\r\nI was personally wondering if it would be better to catch a Unborn Val'kyr at evening or at night but I caught it pretty much in the middle of the day.\r\n\r\nI already had two Unborn Val'kyrs HH breed that I caught many years ago, I just wanted to complete the collection with the BB breed. I actually also caught my HH breeds in Grizzly Hills way back when.\r\n\r\nI caught the BB breed at these coordinates 79.4 51.8.\r\n\r\n[url=https:\/\/www.curseforge.com\/wow\/addons\/tomtom]TomTom[\/url] (addon) Waypoint\/Coordinates:\r\n\r\n\/way #116 79.4 51.8 Unborn Val'kyr","date":"2024-03-15T09:07:13-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":false,"ptr2":false,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}}];

Was in Scourgeholme and flew just a bit west to area that shows &quot;The Broken Front&quot;. That area there I have seen 2, tamed one and let another guy get the 2nd one. Both poor quality. This is also the area that is shown in the pictures all over the net. Coords are about 74.0 x 64.9<br /><br />2nd place where I got another poor quality and a RARE was west of Icecrown Citadel, down on the lower area on the ground (The Court of Bones). This was about 9:15 CST or so. Coords were 47.9, 86.6 , same area where High Thane Jorfus was walking around.<br /><br />Spent alot of time in The Storm peaks in the Valkyrion area, thinking it would be a logical place for them, but never seen a one.<br /><br />I didn't do anything to get them to spawn, place I was by citadel, there is a couple of cockroach there i killed one time, but other two times, I was just sitting there while playing on the other monitor and it spawned. One up north a bit, i was just flying over and it was there.<br /><br />More discussion and picures at <a href="http://www.warcraftpets.com/community/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=3792&amp;sid=49a6e5bf8a4bebabc3093dc55e65e13b">warcraftpets.com</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>paulodemoc</b></h3>I was just wondering, about the pet description... what if we use that staff, Nibelung, to summon a Valkyr and vanquish a creature of high nobility (northrend rare?) to trigger the spawn of the pet on that zone? Anyone tried that or something of the sorts?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ozlem</b></h3>*5.3 reset our pet teams, before capturing make sure you have a team loaded up and ready to go our you will be unable to engage in battle*<br /><br /><b>About this pet actual</b><br /><ul><li>She is a lvl21-23 Undead pet. Use a critter to weaken her faster.</li><li>She brings two other pets to the battle &amp; they are either Critters, Beasts or Aquatics, depending on the zone you are in. </li><li>She spawns in all qualities</li><li>She can now fly thanks to the latest hotfix</li><li>Her known breeds are: B/B, H/H.</li></ul><br /><ul><li>She has two 'death' abilities which are <a href="/pet-ability=652/haunt">Haunt</a> &amp; <a href="/pet-ability=321/unholy-ascension">Unholy Ascension</a> </li></ul><br />These two abilities are often confused when trying to capture her. Both spells cause the Val'kyr to die, UA is a perma death while Haunt is not. From my understanding UA was <a href="https://twitter.com/mumper/status/335500554996424704" rel="nofollow">hot</a><a href="https://twitter.com/mumper/status/340606218873757697" rel="nofollow">fixed</a> so she wouldn't cast it as often in the wild (as this makes it impossible to tame her) while Haunt is what a lot of players are seeing in battle. Unfortunately if you get the one which casts UA you will need to keep hunting for a new one. The issue with Haunt is it's still hit or miss so she can end up perma dead anyway! If Haunt misses or if your pet which Haunt was applied on dies the round Haunt is due to drop off your Val'kyr <u>will remain dead</u>. To save yourself this heartache I recommend using a pet which has a heal ability so you can try to keep it close to full HP until haunt goes off. Also it's worth the risk having a high hitting pet in your team in case you do get a val'kyr with UA ability as it gives you a chance to knock her down quick and trap before she casts UA.<br /><i>**Please note if you DC, forfeit or lose the battle while she is in this dead state she will not respawn for you. If you forfeit the fight while she is alive she will respawn as any wild battle pet would. Also during PvP pet combat I've found Haunt appears to miss more then hit which in some fights will cost you a win, just FYI.**</i><br /><br /><u>VIDEO</u><br />This pet resurrects critters from death!

I only write this because after some guildies caught theirs she did pop up fairly fast 30min-2hrs, however after one reported a failed attempt we could not find one under the 2hr mark. This is just early on observations so take it with a grain of salt.**ok update on this: was on my low pop server and she was up in two spots at once, flew over her in Loque's spot in Sholazar and then in court of bones Icecrown. I doubt someone had captured her between the time I flew past one &amp; got to the other so it's likely she was up at the same time. Thought I'd share that.**</li><li>As for timers, right now, it's too soon to tell. I had it at 6hrs but there are a whole bunch of new discovered spawn locations I never saw in PTR &amp; mumper did say it wasn't as elusive as the Minfernal so it's likely she is popping up all over the place!</li><li>For those without co-ords head over to user Nalain 's post, they have got visual pin-points on maps.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shamanism</b></h3>There is a lot of speculation about how to obtain this pet, a blizzard GM said &quot;Players do not create the conditions under which it spawns&quot; (paraphrasing) Meaning it does not spawn from killing a rare mob or finishing a raid. It also means it wouldn't spawn from using the Glyph of the Val'kyr, or dying in certain areas. I have my money on the Val'lyr invasion at the Argent Tournament. Or upon the spawn of some rare mob, or event starting. But I dunno, thats my personal theory and it is probably wrong, but its an idea! Any thoughts?<br /><br />Edit - After checking the spawn points and doing some 5.3 live researching, it seems that these spawn spiraticly, and with little to no way to influence the spawning. They spawn in three areas per zone excluding Wintergrasp. From what I've read, one spawns at one of these three points every hour, on the hour... But this has not been confirmed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Forumchibi</b></h3>I was fortunate enough to find this pet tonight in Grizzly Hills, northeast of Dun Argol (coordinates 79, 51) as others have said. I was about to go to bed and gave it one last look.<br /><br />First of all, I will confirm that NPCscan <b>does</b> work, as it triggered when I reached that spot in Grizzly Hills. However, I did get a few false alerts even when standing still, and of course if you open your pet journal, it will very likely trigger, even when I had 'not collected' turned off for me.<br /><br />I did not kill anything, I did not fight any other pets in the area, I simply happened to be flying toward Dun Argol since others talked about it (I didn't even know the coordinates, just that it was NE of Dun Argol), and it was there when I arrived. I never saw anyone else around before, during, or after the battle.<br /><br />Also, <b>the spawn time is apparently not that long, potentially as little as only an hour or so</b>. One person who saw me in Zul'Drak added me to their friends list while I was raiding/camping a spot in ZD on my alt, and told me about an hour before I caught mine that they caught one in Borean Tundra (and I did check their Armory profile to make sure they weren't kidding about getting it). I finished raiding early and they messaged me around 11:20-30pm server time, and I got mine at around 12:40am.<br /><br />I started off at Zul'Drak in the middle, and worked my way down to Grizzly Hills since so many people seemed to have good luck there. When NPCscan went off, at first I was nervous since the paw icon disappeared from my mini-map before I hovered over it, and I thought it was another false alarm or that someone else happened to grab it before me, but then it refreshed and appeared. Phew!<br /><br />The fight was fairly easy for me. I only &quot;needed&quot; two level 25 pets, a Bandicoon Kit (used Tongue Lash twice which luckily hit enough times to bring it just under 35%, took 4 attempts to catch it) and a Nether Faerie Dragon. The Val'kyr came first (common rarity), and after I caged it, my Bandicoon was down to about 35% health. I was able to get the second pet down to 20% or so, and even though I still had Survival, I decided to swap out to the Nether Faerie Dragon, which finished off the second pet and third without taking much damage at all.<br /><br />The other two pets were just normal common woodland creatures, nothing difficult. The Val'kyr never suicided on me, maybe because it was still near 30% health it didn't find it necessary.<br /><br />Good luck to everyone! It's a great looking pet, and I've been hearing of more people getting it than I thought, especially since it just came out, so hopefully it's not *that* rare (or maybe I'm just disillusioned since I'm usually really unlucky with things like this).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gummiebear007</b></h3>I finally caught mine at the location in ZD on the North side of the road where the giant mob pats. The coords were 24 63. <br /><br />A nice bit of info for those speculating spawn times:<br /><br />At around 11:45 pm Mountain time one of my guildies shouted in chat that she had just caught one in Grizzly Hills. We discussed her strat for a moment before I decided to take one more ride around the &quot;block.&quot; Only 11 minutes after she caught her's, I caught mine there in ZD.<br /><br />I don't think the spawns are very long in between. It's more of a matter of finding the new one when it has spawned.<br /><br />Good luck to those in search!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>979916</b></h3>I can confirm the spawning point in the Court of Bones - near Icecrown Citadel in Icecrown. Coordinations are roughly 48/87 where my Silverdragon spotted it... <br /><br />It felt like I'm about to have a heart attack lol,since my heart was already skipping beats almost at the sight of every green paw on the known spawn locations just to mouseover it and find out it's nothing else but a measly Arctic Hare/Mountain Skunk... Since I was not sure if Silverdragon will pop up the NPC or not,due to me forgetting to clear cache after NPCscan false alarm :(<br /><br />More info regarding the pet:<br />1. It was a poor quality.<br />2. There was no special weather effects or anything like that.<br />3. After capture - the pet is BB breed and is level 21 with stats as follows: HP 1045(1225) / P 189(225) / S 158(188)<br />4. Secondary pets were 2 cockroaches.<br /><br />The capture happened on Argent Dawn EU at roughly 9 am (due to the euphoria when I saw that it was actually there,cannot state the exact time.)<br /><br />Pet combo I used - Celestial Dragon + Kun-Lai Runt + Terrible Turnip. It worked great. I used Celestial Dragon for the initial hit,swapped to Turnip to get it low enough for capture to not risk killing her,caged her on 2nd try once she was low enough,switched to Runt and completely destroy the cockroaches.<br /><br />She also did not use her Haunt ability on my attempt,no clue why not,perhaps because she was low enough all the time till she got caged.<br /><br />Good luck to you all!</div>

It appears we've found them all!</b> You will probably still be better off flying between known locations rather than camping, at least until the &quot;big hunt&quot; dies off as other collectors snag theirs. Good luck everyone!<br /><br /><i>Original post:</i><br /><s>I think that these little gals have a chance to spawn on <b>any</b> battle pet location in Northrend, along with all the &quot;voids&quot; that lack battle pets, such as the coastline in Sholazar. This truly is a &quot;needle in a haystack&quot; pet, from the look of things.</s><br /><br />I decided to go hunting around 45 minutes ago and began studying the recorded catches listed both here and on Warcraftpets. From what I've seen, it really <i>appears</i> to be random; some spawn on or next to roads, others in the middle of zones or on ridges. Some spawns are exactly on other battle pet spawns (via map addons like Pet Tracker). I decided the best strategy would be to just fly around and cover literally every inch of every zone. I ended up snagging mine at <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/maps?data=2817:186570">18,57 in Crystalsong Forest</a>, which I believe has not been recorded yet.<br /><br /><s>I think that actively flying around spamming a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=71163/unborn-valkyr#comments:id=1855318">targeting macro</a> will give you much better odds than camping a known spawn location and competing with several others. In fact, I flew past a few of the recorded coords, and each one had 2-5 people just sitting and waiting for who knows how long. Check in on known spawn locations while doing a flythrough, but I highly suggest NOT camping them. </s><br /><br />Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cronight</b></h3>Well this is just my opinion, but I hope will be help you to catch the cutiest pet atm:<br /><br />1st Avoid havy camping area like Icecrown and Sholazar Basin<br />2nd Try focus on camping in Grizzly Hills since area is not too much big and spawn points are not too far away from each others, so you can check all 3 very fast<br />3th The spawn points in Grizzly Hills are: 61,18 / 26,57 and 79,51<br />4th While you flyin to Grizzly Hills (ofc from Dalaran), you can choose route accross Crystalsong Forest where is another spawn point at 17,57, then go to Dragonblight and check also at 82,66 and continue to Grizzly Hills to check all 3 spawn points<br /><br />So all in all you can check <b>5</b> spawn point in only couple of minutes hoping you will find your pet.<br /><br />Happy hunting to all of you and never give up, yes camping is not easy, but nothing like camping Loque (spent 23 day to finally tame him)<br /><br />Cheers</div>

Really,I truly mean it.. however, please, please, for the love of all things good in Azeroth, do NOT fly around to other spawn points where fellow pet hunters are camping and pull your pet out to show off. It sets off scanners and might give them a heart attack, (trust me I know, I just had one!) So, please be nice to your fellow Val'kyr hunters and don't make them have to relog to clear their cache or give them heart attacks!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>818641</b></h3>I can confirm that she does spawn at Howling Fjord 68.10, 67.63 location. I can also confirm that she does now fly with you. Also to those of you who cant get her to rez critters, she does, you just have to sit next to the dead thing for like two or three minutes, hope they make her respond faster. I have not gotten her to do the sleep emote, even when i went afk for thirty minutes. Also one more thing, for some reason her target box is higher than the visual model, what i mean by that is when ever an enemy pet hits her with an ability or you put a target marker icon on her etc. it goes way above her head. I dont know why this really bugs me but I also hope they fix this as well. Overall, this is an awesome pet to have.</div>

I found one there on 5/22/13 and my Cinder Kitten annihilated it. I wanted to cry. I flew to all the other spots people talked about and searched for many hours now seeing another (on both Shattered Hand and VeCo). Today I logged in at the same spot and there was not one. I checked my other monitor for something, looked back and there she was. I was smart enough to use my turnip this time. She did not use haunt on me at all making it a very each catch. She came with two shore crabs. Others have stated that she comes with aquatics so my moth made quick work of them. Good luck guys!</div>

(Below Skorn)<br /><br />It was poor quality B/B but that's alright since I already had a battlestone ready.<br /><br />Also wanna add that people really gotta stop hunting for a rare, Ive seen several comments where people are saying they got their rare after this and this kill, Let other collector's get it too.

I have logged my death knight by the spawn point near Death's Stand in eastern Borean Tundra.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Riven</b></h3>After compiling all of the information I've read over the past couple of days, I think I've figured out the best strategy for finding an Unborn Val'kyr. I started out flying between all of the spawn points repeatedly, switched to camping a few times, but the one thing that was effective for me was this:<br /><br />1. Park 3 of your toons at each of the 3 spawn points in a particular zone. (I put 3 of my toons at each point in Borean Tundra.)<br />2. Cycle between the 3 toons until one spawns. A friend of mine caught one exactly on the hour at the Northern Borean tundra spawn point. So I decided to check on the hour as well. At 4am I checked all 3 spawn points and there was a Val'kyr up at one of them. The point it chooses to spawn at out of the 3 is completely random. It CAN be the same one twice in a row. Or it may not be. <br /><br /><b>It can possibly be deduced that every hour, on the hour, an Unborn Val'kyr spawns at 1 of the 3 points in each Northrend zone. By having a toon on each spawn point in one zone, you should theoretically be able to capture one within 1 hour.</b><br /><br />If you have been spending many hours trying to get a Val'kyr, please try this strategy and see if it works for you. You can also recruit to friends to sit at the spawn points for you if you don't have 3 alts for it or you're on a server where you wouldn't have enough time to swap toons. <br /><br />Good luck!</div>

From 380HP to 0 and I didn't even do *anything*, I switched pets ffs.<br /><br />I was shocked, frustrated, angry, and gave up in the hopes that *maybe* she'd pop up again, as some pets do when you leave combat.<br />She didn't.<br /><br />But just now I re-checked her abilities and it might have been that she used Haunt, which causes her to appear dead. So hell, maybe she would have gotten up again after the spell ran its duration or whatever. Now I'll have to find another one, crap.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maritas</b></h3>Great advice and been trying to get one of these but just about every spawn point is heavily camped on Trollbane. I don't think I'd mind as much if they were not all cross zone server. I didn't see a single person from my server and there were as much as 4 people sitting in one spot and not even of the same guild. I'll keep searching</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1068010</b></h3>Ravenholt-US and The Venture Co-US are CRZ free zones, meaning that they are standalone servers like those in the old days.<br /><br />What I did to capture my Unborn Val'kyr is made a level 1 Orc warrior, took the Zeppelin to Borean Tundra, and corpse ran to 80,48 and camped out there. It's a long run, and they are PVP realms, but the competition is far lower than that of any other realms as there are no CRZ's.<br /><br />I do not recommend just sitting there and waiting for it to spawn, however. It is a very long spawn timer, insanely long. I sat there in windowed mode for 14+ hours with no spawn. What did eventually got me the pet was just logging in periodically to check whether or not the pet had spawned - eventually it did.<br /><br />Just make sure you're using your Terrible Turnip, and happy hunting!</div>

Today was the first day that not many people were out camping, so it seems Tuesdays is the best chance (when everyone is out and about raiding or capping their vp).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>847229</b></h3>After seeing the RIDICULOUS amount of people camping the Fenris spawn points, I made a NE on Ravenholdt US ( I am partial to them.....a human would be faster) <br /> I took the boat from Stormwind to Borean Tundra. The FP at Valiance Keep may go there, but she was broke so I just jumped off the boat as soon as Borean Tundra loaded, and swam ( no sharks) to Unu'pe Village. <br /> This is a pvp non crz- realm but I only saw one toon while I walking up the hill.<br /> At the top of the road leading out onto the plain at Death's Stand is a stationary Unu'pe Turtle Rider if you do not have co-ords. <br />This is where you want to leave your toon. This is the 80, 48 spawn location.<br />Though it takes about 15 minutes to get the toon to this spot it is by far easier than the mindless camping and fighting over spawn locations. <br /> I left my toon hiding under the Turtle Rider at around 8pm Moday evening- Central Time. I logged back in around 1 am Tuesay morning and there was a lovely uncommon Val'kyr waiting for me. I was completely alone. No stress or worry of losing the tame. <br />I almost feel guilty at how easy it was.....<i>Almost</i>....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1118021</b></h3>After camping on and off all last week I decided to try and sit as much as i could at one spawn point yesterday. Camped 61.9, 18.03 spawn point in Grizzly Hills (Exodar, US server), with no success from 8 am til about 7 pm yesterday. When raid time came, i knew that with my luck I would miss the spawn while trudging through the trenches with my guild, but like any good soldier I did my duty and went and vanquished the evil forces that hold sway over Azeroth. <br /><br />Once victory was obtained and loot rewarded, I returned to my spot and was about ready to give up for the night and log for bed when at 12:20 am exactly an adorable Unborn Val'kyr spawned right next to me. I quickly engaged battle and captured her.<br /><br />Coincidentally, my friend caught his on Quel'thalas at the spawn point by River's Heart in Sholazar Basin at 12:05 am, just 15 minutes before i captured mine. Reporting times and servers for spawn information.<br /><br />Happy hunting to all of you still in search for this pet!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Leechesx</b></h3>This is my girlfriend and I's method of obtaining it. We thought of this idea by ourselves however others may have already done so and posted it.<br /><br />The idea is to find the deadest realm on your region, so for example Earthen Ring EU is a dead role playing realm. What we did was one of us would make a Lvl 1 character on Earthen Ring, the other would fly with a two seater to the human starting zone (or orc for horde) and pick them up. We would then fly to the stormwind docks (orgrimmar zepplins) and take the transport to Northrend. <br /><br />From this point you can decide your route. Once hovering above a spawning point, simply tell your partner to jump off your mount. Then the lvl 90 kicks the lvl 1 from the group. This makes them phase back into their own dead realm. It took us about 1h of searching the individual spawn points to find two of these pets, one for each of us. The bulk of the time spent will be rezzing your level 1 character.<br /><br />Once the lvl 1 character has the pet, log out and log onto your lvl 90 and repeat the process for your taxi driver friend.<br /><br />Things to note:<br /><br />- If a pet is underneath or very close to a mob, keep rezzing closer and closer to it. If you enter a pet battle with it the mob will deaggro you and you can capture it, then die and get invited back to the safe realm.<br />- Some areas such as south east Icecrown are heavily phased. This will mean your lvl 1 will have to run south and jump off the dam into crystalsong forest to dephase.<br />- We did this between 3 AM and 4 AM to greatly increase our chances of finding a pet.<br /><br />The map we used was posted in these comments, i cannot link to it because my account is new. Imgur / xaCRdtq is the site and image code though.<br /><br />Good luck and happy hunting :)<br /><br />- Leeches and Purple</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Entilzha2161</b></h3>Ravenholdt - US 12:35 PM EST 5/31 Borean Tundra 48,8 spawn. <br /><br />I was on a level 2 horde toon and a level ? ally DK was sitting right next to it afk. I won the battle and emoted an apology, he was afk the whole time and I imagine quite unhappy if he got back before autolog, which I didn't wait around to find out.<br /><br />I had all spawns in the zone covered with alts as I've heard that the spawn will occur at one of the three in the zone and not at any particular node. Not sure if that's true but how I see it the more nodes you plop an alt on the more likely you are to eventually login and find something, though since people are reporting that it can't hurt to cover all 3 in a zone if possible.</div>

I made a nelf and ran to Darnassus then took the boat to SW then to Northrend and swam to 80,44 BT and as soon as I got there, BOOM there she was - poor quality but that's what marked flawless battle stones are for, right? :) Don't give up peeps!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JLarks</b></h3>Must admit I just got very lucky, flew to 65/35 in Dragonblight, and a rare Unborn Val'kyr was waiting for me!<br /><br />One thing I will add, having an aqua pet will be handy as they take reduced undead damage. I got lucky in that I started with my eternal strider, quite a good choice against this pet. Although I can imagine frogs are good too.<br /><br />Hope this helps. Good luck all! :D<br /><br />N.B. It seems like it is glitched, the pet's name is miles above where it's head is, and when attacks go against it they seem to aim for the ceiling of the pet battle window.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wheeljack</b></h3>Guess I was <b>really</b> lucky. <br /><br />Decided earlier today to look for it. Seems like it's a very popular and heavily camped pet.I looked up spawnplaces on wowhead and took the grand tour of Northrend without any luck. <br /><br />Went back after a Naxx-run (for more pets) and searched abit in the same places. Figured I'd linger abit in Storm Peaks in case of snow and a chance for the <a href="/npc=62864/arctic-fox-kit">Arctic Fox Kit</a> too. (Plus, I like the NR-Zones alot). Went to the spawnplace north of Valkyrion and saw another player (from another realm too) camping at that spot. I was about to leave when suddenly it spawned right underneath us. He beat me to it, fought and caged the pet. <br /><br />&quot;Ah well...&quot; I thought, at least now I have the spawn confirmed. I looked abit more, before I decided to check Zul'Drak before I went to bed. Nothing near Thryms End, flew up to Altar of Rhunok, nothing there either, but at Gundrak I saw a paw, frantically mouseovered and confirmed... there it was. Just as the battle started I saw the shadow of a Cloud Serpent hovering, so I guess I was more than lucky. Got the pet caged, uncommon, but I had Undead Battle-Stones and quickly got it upgraded.</div>

It was a poor quality one but I didn't care.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>355492</b></h3>I've had great luck at the Forgotten Shore (Dragonblight). 2 different times I have found one there. On my hunt to find the H/H breed I also found one at the northern borean tundra spawn. This was shortly after getting one from Dragonblight, so <b>it does NOT take hours for another to spawn after someone catches one. </b> Heh I feel bad for releasing one but I had to make room for my H/H. Caught 4 Val'kyrs with little effort. My advice - don't sit there camping one spawn point for hours. Make 1 round around the continent and log out at a spawn. It's not worth wasting so much time - you just have to get lucky</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Elysoun</b></h3>Just caught one today (a poor B/B version). Not sure if I'll use a stone on this one or try for the H/H variety. Found him in the furthest northeast corner of Storm Peaks. I almost didn't go to that particular point since it was so far out of the way.<br /><br />The fight was easy enough, and even got him most of the way down with a pet I was leveling (4 levels below). <br /><br />Not sure if I should continue searching now, or wait a while. Any idea when the next one should pop?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Orangeichigo</b></h3>Here's my story and tips:<br /><br />I was camping for days on a normal server, making rounds whenever I can, I did not find anything other the fellow campers. Damn you cross-realm! (This is worse than camping for a spirit beast back in the days)<br /><br />Then I tried to log in right after a server restart today to find one, nope, nothing<br /><br />So I suddenly thought, since the RP servers had (in my perspective) a smaller population altogether, why not try to find it on a RP server? so I transferred a toon to an RP server and viola, two hours later, I got my own Unborn Val'kyr on my second round in Northrend. I had only seen one camper on the way, compared to 7+ on a normal server.<br /><br />I know you people on the RP servers will hate me for saying this: it's waaaaaay easier to find it on a RP server, try it if you are on a normal server.<br /><br />Good Luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Morrigan81</b></h3>Just caught a poor one on Wildhammer US (low pop) 12:02 EST at the near-Gundrak spawn point in Zul'Drak. I've been casually camping the last couple days, will sit at a spawn point, kill all nearby critters while I wait in dungeon queue (dps so 10-15mins per). After coming out of a fairly quick dungeon (Scarlet Halls) she was right under where I was hovering. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Symphone</b></h3>Caught mine today on Dalaran server in Zul'Drak at 11:20 Central Time. It was at 57.77, 39.60 just East of the Altar of Rhunok, below the aqueduct. She spawned as a common level 22 mob with two frogs of the same level. As rare as this pet is I don't feel right about trying to catch multiples for a rare until everyone has had a chance to catch this little beauty, so I'll be using a stone to upgrade it. Like others have said, PLEASE don't fly around the spawn sites with yours out, it will ruin someone's day if they see it on the scan and can't catch it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Makita</b></h3>Alright. First, I found one in Grizzly Hills, 79.6, 51.7, near Dun Argol.

Now, I will give you a tip: <u><b>Do not</b></u> use a two round ability like Chrominius' ravage because it will most likely <u>kill</u> the val'kyr and it <b><u>Does not</u></b> respawn.<br />Second, I found one in Dragonblight, 82.0, 66.0, near the Forgotten Shore. Entered the battle with a team consisting of <b>a lvl 15 Pandaren water spirit, a lvl 14 Phoenix hatchling and a lvl 16 Fungal abomination <u>THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU <i>WILL</i> DIE</u></b> and it will <b>not</b> respawn.<br />Yesterday night, I found one in Zuldrak, 75.1, 22.2, near Gundrak. Now, having learned my lesson, I entered the battle with a lvl 20 Arctic fox kit(uncommon), a lvl 20 Spider (rare) and a 25 Sunreaver micro sentry for backup, and I finally captured my Unborn Val'kyr, common, B/B, lvl 21.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PatchEu</b></h3>I want to share how I caught this pet; I spent around 6 or 7 hours since 5.3 flying an optimal route around Northrend looking for spawns, without ever seeing the pet. My server is one of the most populated in the EU region.<br /><br />Eventually I got sick of this, and searched RealmPop for the least populated EU realm. This led to me logging onto Vek'lor and creating two level 1 Human characters, which I ran into Stormwind and onto a boat to Northrend. I got the characters to the lower left and right spawn points in Borean Tundra, taking about 30 minutes in total. There was no-one else online in Northrend, and only 2 characters online in Shrine (Pandaria city) at this time.<br /><br />The next day, I logged on each character once every few hours. Just now, I found a Val'kyr pet at the left spawn point on the Vrykul beach and caught it. <br /><br />Doing it this way took about <b>1 hour</b> in total and saved me a lot of frustration and unhappiness in flying around or camping spawn points.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ospreyfalcon</b></h3>I don't know if this has happened to other people.<br /><br />I am on a quiet realm and often look for valkyrs for people on my realID list. But for the two last times, I find a valkyr, engage in battle, invite the person and when he arrives and I forfeit, the valkyr despawns and doesn't come back out. <br /><br />I am still looking for the cause of this. Is it because I engage and then invite someone? Can one only invite and then engage? I need to find out. <br /><br />In the meantime, please let me know if this has happened to you in some way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1131635</b></h3>Caught today after much farming. I thought I would leave a comment illustrating my method and time commitment.<br /><br />1) If you really want this pet, make sure you have NPCScan and Tom-Tom<br />2) Don't Camp a particular spawn<br />3) Add the valk to your NPCScan, and create the 3 marcos listed above for Tom-Tom<br />4) Dont kill yourself farming this.<br /><br />I lost the first spawn, (wasn't looking for this pet at all, just filling out the Northrend collection achievement) I saw in Zul Drak ( by the big path) because I was not ready with a strong enough pet team. I boxed her, killed one pet and then got finished off by a poor quality squirrel (it was close...) After this rage worthy defeat I gave up for a while and would only occasionally poke around Northrend hoping the RNG god would hook me up with a spawn right outside of Dalaran. After the initial rage wore off I began camping the spawn I first saw her at, because....well why not...This was utterly unfruitful.<br /><br />So I decided to take what appears to have been a pro tip, and configured Tom Tom and NPCScan with the appropriate information. 3 passes around Northrend, about 20 minutes a piece...nothing, and then ! NPCScan goes off and I quickly dropped down and captured a poor quality, which I immediately stoned to rare :)<br /><br />My one piece of information which I haven seen here yet is to ensure that you have track target on. When NPCscan went off, there were several battle pets on the mini map but luckily I had track target on, so I clicked the NPCScan alert box to target her and know which of the pets was her, flew down and tagged her. Quite literally 3 other players dropped from the sky and attempted to grab her as well. I think if I would have had to mouse-over the mini map to see which pet there was the Valk, I would have surely lost her. <br /><br />I know this information is near worthless to someone seeking the pet, but I think the tips I took from here really allowed me to cut a lot of farming time off. Trust in the method, and trust in RNG.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1122222</b></h3>Just got mine at 8.45, on Jaedenar EU! She was outside the cave close to K3. <br /><br />Tip: to make sure you don't kill this beauty while catching her, use a Terrible Tunip. Their first attack, Weakening Blow that ensures she will have 1 HP remaining. <br /><br />Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Javelin</b></h3>Today I got a really lucky catch. I was in Storm Peaks and was just about to finish the searching due to other things to do, so on the second to last spot I planned to look for her, there she was, althrough I was a little scared because last time I found one, she died while haunting my own pet and it died with the debuff on. But this one was an Uncommon quality so I started to carefully bring her HP down but even when it looked like she was below 30% I wasn't able to cage her. Then... to all my panic and horror she casted Unholy Ascension. I almost screamed then I saw her coming back to life due to the Undead racial. To my surprise, the cage button was glowing so I took my only chance (catching a pet always takes at least 2 tries for me), threw the cage and BAM she was mine and I almost fell out of the chair due to extreme relief.<br />I caught her on Ragnaros(EU) server around 10:45 server time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>981407</b></h3>If you battle this pet and end up catching it but end up getting beat by the other 2 pets that accompany it you will lose this pet and it will not respawn. Just found this, got excited, battled it with my team very low in health and lost this pet. Make sure to heal to full health!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>29188</b></h3>So...noticed something cool about mine today. I was waiting on sulik'shor to spawn and was killing the little bandicoon kits around his spawn point with my hunters multi shot. I was looking away and I heard a resurrection be cast by someone...it was my valkyr resurrecting one of the bandicoons. Don't know if this is old news but...pretty cool! He did it again right after I killed the rare. And hey...another one while I was typing this!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dramfiolz</b></h3>I was able to get this one very easily by making a DK on the Ravenholdt-US server (which is not only RPPVP, but also the only RPPVP server in its datacenter, so it is not CRZ'd with any other servers). I actually made the toon to get the Minfernal pet, and after I did that, I figured I'd check some of the more accessible spawn points for the Unborn Val'kyr before I bothered leveling it up further.<br /><br />A toon of any level can take the zeppelins to Northrend, and now you auto-learn the flight point to Dalaran as well. All I did was zep in with my fresh 58 DK, fly to Dal, and take the portal down to Crystalsong Forest, which I thought would be the best place to start since there's little reason for other players to be in the zone, and many of the mobs are non-aggro. The first spawn point I checked had an Unborn Val'kyr. This was in the morning right after a restart.<br /><br />So glad to be done camping these pets. Bless you, Ravenholdt!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>972646</b></h3>If you are after this Pretty little Pet, I would recomend searching for her early in the morning. I actually caught mine at about 6 am Server Time. Was just hovering peacefully, waiting for me in the nothern part of Icecrown. Not sure of how many can spawn at a time, how long the respawn time is or even if more than 1 can spawn at a time. All I know is mine was there in the morning... I wonder if its a &quot;late night/early morning&quot; spawn... anyway, at those times you wont find that much competition either... so all in all, good advice :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Akitnaya</b></h3>After finding out about it I knew it'd take a WHILE for me to find this lil pet. I'm on Area 52 US &amp; it's plagued by CRZ. I put the NPC I.D. into <a href="http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/npcscan" rel="nofollow">_NPCScan</a>/<a href="http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/silver-dragon" rel="nofollow">SilverDragon</a> &amp; dl-ed <a href="http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tomtom" rel="nofollow">TomTom</a>/<a href="http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info10496-SuperDuperMacro.html" rel="nofollow">SuperDuperMacro</a> &amp; copied + pasted the waypoints given by @violetta &amp; was on my way, circling Northrend. Day 1, I found nothing. I literally searched for the whole evening then all through the night. Nothing. So I went to sleep around 6 or 7 in the morning &amp; woke up around 1pm &amp; started on my search again. In between I took bathroom/food breaks &amp; also breaks from my hunt to do LFR &amp; the weekly Barrens quest &amp; pet battles. Then around 7:21pm, I see the lil paw print around the Bor'gorok Outpost spawn point in Borean Tundra &amp; think &quot;oh it's just another stupid hare again&quot; but no, it's the Unborn Val'kyr! I swooped down &amp; started pet battling it right away &amp; finally luck was on my side for once &amp; it was a rare quality! For the pet battle I used a lvl 25 Arcane Eye, Huge Toad &amp; Phoenix Hatchling. The pet was a lvl 22 so it dropped down to lvl 20. I would have been perfectly happy even if it was a poor quality because I was totally gonna use a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=92741">Flawless Battle-Stone</a> to upgrade it but to my pleasant surprise, I didn't have to. <br /><br />Also, a lil side note, this pet flies with you &amp; follows you when you're mounted up &amp; flying which I personally always liked.<br /><br />Waypoints as @violetta had listed - <br /><br />/way Sholazar Basin 58.5, 22.0<br />/way Sholazar Basin 44.47, 69.59<br />/way Sholazar Basin 36.8, 19.4<br />/way Icecrown 47.9, 86.6<br />/way Icecrown 73.8, 64.5<br />/way Icecrown 43.0, 33.0<br />/way Crystalsong Forest 18.6, 57.0<br />/way Crystalsong Forest 43.3, 44.0<br />/way Crystalsong Forest 67.8, 49.5<br />/way Zul'Drak 57.0, 39.8<br />/way Zul'Drak 75, 22<br />/way Zul'Drak 24.3, 63.7<br />/way Storm Peaks 42.5, 78.5<br />/way Storm Peaks 65, 41<br />/way Storm Peaks 29.0, 50.0<br />/way Dragonblight 82, 66<br />/way Dragonblight 26.9, 54.1<br />/way Dragonblight 64.4, 43.7<br />/way Grizzly Hills 61, 18<br />/way Grizzly Hills 79.60, 50.79<br />/way Grizzly Hills 26, 57<br />/way Borean Tundra 48, 8<br />/way Borean Tundra 80, 48<br />/way Borean Tundra 32.7, 60.1<br />/way Howling Fjord 71.91, 43.39<br />/way Howling Fjord 45, 43<br />/way Howling Fjord 68.10, 67.63<br /><br />(These all fit into 1 macro if you use SuperDuperMacro.)<br /><br />Edited for spelling errors.</div>

So I had a dot on my map in Grizzly Hills at 61,18 and 62,18 ... and I told my hubby &quot;Ok, one more waypoint check, maybe I'll get lucky....&quot; and there she was! Directly between the two dots on my map.<br /><br />*happy dance*<br /><br />I used a Rapana Whelk to widdle her down to 30% and the trap took about 4-5 tries, but I nabbed her and killed the other two pets easily. Finally, she is mine!<br /><br />Not the most desirable breed (B/B) and only common quality.... but I've got a bank full of stones and one with her name on it! :) So happyyyy!<br /><br />Good hunting, friends!</div>

My pets out leveled her greatly so I was afraid of killing her. Nearly had a heart attack when she killed herself ( I was unaware of this ability going in ). My first trap had failed and this was my last shot to catch her, seeing as she would die after one round after rezzing.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Heimdallen</b></h3>When the Argent Tourny came out during Northrend, I didn't bother using my Champion's Seals to get the (at that time) vanity pets, but now that they are battle pets I have been going back and doing the dailies there to farm the seals to get all of the pets available through the tournament. As a result, I do the Chilmaw quest almost every day and am always checking to see if an Unborn Val'kyr is up in that area since it has a spawn point there.<br /><br />Well, today for the first time in like 4 months of looking, I swept in not even really thinking about whether one would be up, I just gave up hope long ago, and just started in on Chillmaw. It was at that time I noticed there was indeed an Unborn Val'kyr right underneath him and in the middle of the 3 cultist bombers. I DESPERATELY tried in vein to move the mobs away and get all the AOE damage going on away from him, but I was too late. He died.<br /><br />So even if you've long ago given up hope, don't just hurridly start in on Chillmaw, look at the area first. Because even though it's only a video game, I am now wicked depressed that I blew my only opportunity so far after like 4 months of searching to grab one. So stupid of me. Be careful, look before you leap on to Chillmaw. <br /><br />I camped over the little Val'kyr's body for an hour hoping he'd respawn there again since he wasn't killed in a pet battle, but no dice, he didn't come back after an hour at least. <br /><br />I know this is largely a sob story about this and not primarily informational, but it's also a warning about getting complacent and impatient and not taking the time to be sure a Val'kyr hasn't spawned right where everyone fights Chillmaw, it's easy to be like me and want to speed through it fast as possible and as a result make a horrible horrible mistake like mine. Don't do it. Slow down. Look both ways. Take time. Or you might really regret your actions like me. :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>991468</b></h3>It's probably already been mentioned somewhere, but encase it hasn't I wanted to add that Pet Tracker is a good addon to get for finding this guy. Once it's installed you can type in unborn and it will show you spawn points of this pet on your map, so you can easily fly to the spots without using Tom Tom or looking up coordinates every time.<br /><br />It still took me days of going spawn point to spawn point before I found one, but eventually there it was.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>288403</b></h3>When I saw one near the (65, 35) spawnpoint in Dragonblight I panicked and engaged with a team consisting of a (25) Gilnean Raven and (5) Mini Mindslayer... I actually got it low and captured but wiped to the 2 pets which joined, because a penguine felt like using slippery ice (missed 4 times in a row...) needless to say, I raged pretty hard. So I went to battle Beegle Blastfuse in the Howling Fjord zone as was my original plan and it lasted for about 5-10 minute and then I flew (45, 43) spawn point in Howling Fjord and found another and prepared my team (Direhorn for the lucky stun), captured it and defeated her companions too.<br /><br />So: Either there can be more than 1 up at a time, or when you kill/wipe to it, it possible will spawn in another location, so don't give up if you wipe! Hope it helps<br /><br />Edit: Dropping back to say I found my THIRD within an hour, caught it too, but sadly with the same breed as the prvious (100%+ HP), found at the (37, 19) point in Sholazar Basin</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shealle</b></h3>Tonight I was rearranging toons to different spawn points in Northend for this rare when I finally stumbled over a green paw that wasn't a false hope! I captured it, and was happy with my poor breed just to have this rare pet finally captured. But, I still had toons parked throughout the continent that could be better used elsewhere. After capturing it in Grizzly Hills, I logged into my toon I had just parked in Howling Fjord, and there she was flying again. I was doubly shocked, because I had just logged my toon that won it back at Seven Stars.<br /><br />Guys, I don't blame anyone for hating me at this moment, because I considered it a gift from the gods, and after a quick screenshot, and while no one else was still around, I entered battle for it, and captured it again. This time, getting lucky with the better breed. I'm still shaking from excitement.<br /><br />Posting this, because the odds of having the new spawn happen within 1 minute of capturing, hearthing, and switching over to my other toon was surprising to me. I remember reading that the theory was after successful captures respawns would occur faster... just wanted to share the superfast respawn. <br /><br />Good luck to you all. (And yes, all my toons are now moved from the spawn spots - not trying again!)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>timmune</b></h3>Last night I decided to look for the Unborn Val'kyr for the first time. Following generous and detailed tips from comments posted here, my endeavor proved successful. My experience as follows:<br /><br />After about 45 minutes flying between spawn location coords shared in this thread, my NPCscan first went off at one of the coords in Zul'drak. After 7 unsuccessful attempts to trap her, she decided to kill herself which was, naturally, unappreciated. I continued however and with about 10 minutes encountered her again in Crystalsong. <br /><br />During my second encounter I had successfully trapped her when I realized 2/3 of my pets were dead from the previous fight, which made me feel really special, after her teammates barely finished off my one active pet.<br /><br />I continued and encountered her again about 2.5 hours later and successfully captured her. The lowest quality, but of course upgraded her to uncommon. Just scored a flawless battle stone, so she'll now be rare.<br /><br />Was randomly flying around doing takers quest line in northrend when I spotted and captured her again, lowest quality again.<br /><br />Either way, considering I'm on a medium pop server, I'm pleased with the outcome. About 5 hours time invested and I now have two Val'kyrs.<br /><br />Thanks everyone for the posts and good luck to those on the hunt.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sereilbex</b></h3>Just bagged my Unborn Val'kyr of uncommon (green) quality at the 17,57 coords in Crystalsong Forest, the one right under Dalaran. Used my Flawless Battle Stone to make her a Rare! Doing the &quot;Happy Dance!&quot; Had lost her once before about a week earlier in Ice crown, at the spawn point 42,33.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Breakability</b></h3>I'd like to confirm the Borean Tundra spawn point at Death's End (where I lost the first poor-quality Val'kyr to Haunt) and the Dragonblight spawn point at the broken end of the road leading to Wyrmrest Temple (where I caught a common quality Val'kyr). <br /><br />I was unlucky in the first fight. The trap wouldn't catch the stupid thing and she was spamming Death Coil at that point. That was annoying. She died because of Haunt. This was on my alt server.<br /><br />On my main server, I got lucky with the second one. Her first attack hit, second one missed, and then the trap caught.<br /><br />Good luck and happy hunting! While this was only in about the span of an hour for me, I know it's taken other people much longer.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>togahsisoka</b></h3>Finally caught one within an hour of servers coming up today... I wanted to test if it behaved liked other special spawns that are up in force after a server restart. I checked all known spawn points in Crystalsong Forest, Zul'Drak, Icecrown, Sholazar Basin and found him/her on the *LAST* spawn point I checked in the Borean Tundra.<br /><br />Hypothesis: This pet does spawn with a server restart, but only in one place at a time as opposed to en masse spawnings of minfernals and such.<br /><br />If I feel like I need more than one (if you can have more than one...), I'll test this out and let you know.<br /><br />Happy hunting!<br /><br />10/8/13 Update: Again, found one just flying around NR right after a server restart... in the 3rd zone I visited.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>togahsisoka</b></h3>Second week in a row I've found one by flying around NR *immediately* after server came up...<br /><br />I went ahead and hit all spawn points and only found that one.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xorthos</b></h3>Just wanted to toss my experience in for those camping it. I was in Icecrown, leveling up pets around Corp'Rethar gate, when one randomly spawned.<br /><br />I had circled through the area for maybe an hour just fighting anything that popped up on my map, and saw it.<br /><br />Told my guildmate who was camping it, and they circled around the Ymirheim area, from gate to gate until they had one spawn about an hour or two later.<br /><br />Could have been pure luck on both of our parts, but seemed pretty okay.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>togahsisoka</b></h3>OK, I can now say with some certainty that if you get on your server right after a restart, there is an Unborn Val'kyr somewhere in Northrend.<br /><br />This is my third score in three weeks, always right after a restart. I can't tell you where its gonna spawn, but it is there...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LightningBladez</b></h3>Wow, I can't believe I found this before the weekly server reset. I went around trying to park my different alts at different locations across different realms. Had about more than an hour and a half left till server reset and decided to make a run throughout Northrend just to see what kind of competition I have at different spawn points. <br /><br />Luckily I flew towards Gundrak and found one near the Altar of Rhunok (57, 39.8) US Area 52 ~(6:15am PDT)<br /><br />Couldn't get NPCScan to really work for me, so I used a target macro with a raid warning instead.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>657368</b></h3>Got mine at 7am second day of farming. Was actually on my last farm character flying the zone where I'd parked her ... Was flying up to my last spawn point to check in sholazar and there she was. She was uncommon and didn't suicide! I quickly switched to my other camping toons on that server to see if she had spawned somewhere else I'd already checked after I captured her.. but didn't see another one.<br /><br />The only thing I would add is that it's helpful to append the following to your waypoint macros:<br /><br />/closestway</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>657368</b></h3>OMG, it just dawned on me.. all of you who think you lost the pet because she suicides.. she's not suiciding! She's doing her thing where she enters your current pet's body for five rounds. Just wait it out.. she will return .. and when you've killed the rest of them she will appear.<br /><br />Or at least make sure she's doing ascention and not just haunt before you forfeit</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vandrir</b></h3>Found one last night at 2:45AM. It was located at 82.00 \ 66.00 in Borean Tundra. Very quick battle with nothing unexpected. I had made one full lap around Northrend and had logged out for about an hour. When i logged back in I was going to go from Borean Tundra to Dragonblight and log out there for the night. Good luck to everyone still searching for this one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>897742</b></h3>Just tamed mine 12 mins ago at 2238 realm time. Realm: Winterhoof Zone: Grizzly Hills - 61.6, 18.2. I tried camping Zuldrak but kept getting false alarms from people entering and exiting the dungeon. So I would not suggest camping there. I had several problems with my NPCScan already having it cached. I can confirm that if you are SERIOUS about camping this pet. The best thing to do is: Uncheck the box for Not collected in your pet journal, log out, turn off ALL addons except NPCScan, clear your cache. And then log in...double check your NPCScan by going into your interface, addons, NPCScan, Search, then scrolling to the bottom to make sure that it is BOLD and no x is before it. Once that is done start camping. All in all took me about 8 hours of camping today as this was my first day trying for it. It was a Uncommon Quality but I stoned her to rare and only lost 1 lvl. Going to go power level her now. I wish all my fellow pet hunters the best of luck catching this beauty.<br /><br />Quick side note, I didn't have any other campers there. There were a few people that flew in every now, stopped and looked around, and then flew off. <br /><br />Goodluck!</div>

Spot was 57.0, 39.8 in Zul'Drak, the spawn point just next to the Altar of Rhunok, on the map. Flew by, hovered for a second, and saw the green paw print for her phase in on my map suddenly. Swooped in for the scoop, and solo'd her and her team with my lvl 25 Gilnean Raven. Went infinitely better than I figured it would, and she's Uncommon, to boot. My first (and most likely only) one! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LTygress</b></h3>Got mine this morning at 7:53am server time at the 57,39 location in Zul'drak. <br /><br /><i>Now Dethecus is actually a west coast server, but ever since the low-pop servers were combined (completely combined, not just low-level areas - we are also part of Detheroc, Lethor, and Blackwing Lair now), Dethecus has been reporting Central time zone as the server time. So this would be 7:53am central time, 5:53am pacific time.</i><br /><br />Anyway, I've learned in PVP pet battles that if the Unborn Val'kyr has NOT resurrected herself by the time you kill off the other pets, then she is dead for good. So, KNOWING she is going to kill herself off in battle, you want to use a soft-hitting pet for the other NPCs, to give her time to resurrect herself. I used a spirebound crab. He hits just hard enough to get her health down, but not too hard.<br /><br />I hit her twice to get her low enough, but she healed before I could throw the trap. The next round, she killed herself, and it was me and an alpine hare. About four hits to the rabbit, and she was back. I killed the rabbit, and she stepped back up. Two more rounds and she killed herself again. Then it was me and a snake. At this point I brought up my spirebound crab, and just cast renewing mists and shell shield. This allowed me to basically skip rounds, without dying off, until she resurrected herself again.<br /><br />Once I saw her up, I wiped the snake out, and started throwing traps on her. Second trap made it. She's poor quality, but I don't care. It's MUCH easier to get a stone to upgrade her to rare, than to pass her up and keep searching until I can capture a rare! Even with the two-level downgrade from making her rare quality, it's worth it.<br /><br />She is, however, HH breed. That is awesome because I did NOT want the BB breed! And that's one thing a simple stone can't fix!</div>

I found this beauty in Scholazar Basin around 12:30PM CST today on Azgalor. The coords are 44.42, 68.98. I have been using TomTom, SilverDragon, PetTracker, _NPCScan &amp; Overlay together. I created way points to visit using TomTom. I made a /tar macro as well that I would spam as I approached her known spawning points. She was grey, but that's alright. Happy hunting all.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Eyvindar</b></h3>Have been trying to find one for months now. Last night I logged out at 68, 67 in Howling Fjord and this morning when I checked she was there. Started the fight and when she used what I thought was haunt I just waited it out but she didn't come back. I was upset but I decided to make the rounds of northrend in case she popped up elsewhere. I found her in Storm Peaks at 29, 51 and once again she used what I thought was haunt but didn't come back after it was over. At this point I thought maybe I just wasn't cut out to capture her and should just leave her to people who knew what they were doing. <br /><br />So I went to wowhead to see what was going on. And then it dawned on me she was using unholy ascension and not haunt and I'm just not with it when I first wake up. Decided to give it another go and continue circling northrend. She appeared again at 17, 57 in Crystalsong Forest and I jumped into the fight without realizing I'd let my other pets die in the previous fight in the hopes that 'haunt' would wear off and she would return. <br /><br />I had been using lower level pets so as not to accidentally kill her but all I had was my Sporeling Sprout so I hit her with jab a few times and got her low enough for capture. After a couple failures and losing most of my health, I caught her. I very nearly died trying to finish off the other two pets in the battle, but I managed and she is finally mine!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Fistula</b></h3>Some of us poor souls don't yet have a Val'kyr and are getting pretty cheesed off losing to them in PVP.<br />My favourite team at the moment that has had some success is:<br />1) A frog. The majority of opponents start with the Val'kyr. So start with a fast frog such as S/S Leopard Tree Frog. <br />Tongue Lash X 2 while getting cursed and haunted - will remove a third to a half of the Val'kyr's health before it haunts..<br />Cleansing Rain - reduces duration of haunt, increases aquatic damage and buffs Dreadful Breath (see later).<br />Frog Kiss until dead - with a bit of luck you'll frog your opponents second pet.<br />2) Scourged Whelpling. Preferably H/H so he'll live for 2 rounds of Dreadful Breath. There is a reasonable chance that the Val'kyr in the back row will be dead before it has a chance to come back in to the fight. If your sixth Dreadful Breath is before your 'death round', you can either use Tail Sweep as your death round attack but I like Call Darkness to enhance pet 3.<br />3) Either:<br />A pet to benefit from Call Darkness ie one with Nocturnal Strike, Spectral Strike, Light or Fury of 1000 Fists (though the Monk is vulnerable to undead damage if the Val'kyr does survive to get back in to the battle).<br />My favourite is S/S Crow.<br />Nocturnal Strike.<br />Alpha Strike.<br />Maybe another Call Darkness if you get the chance.<br />Or, if you don't like the risk of the weather changing: <br />Infected Fawn.<br />Adrenaline Rush/Flurry melts the Val'kyr if it's back.</div>

(I also tried flying around using flight paths, but no such luck. I guess if you're bored and wanting something to do then you could try this way too.)<br /><br />She popped up in Sholazar Basin at 44:69, and I got her down to capture able in one hit by using Chrominius's ability &quot;Surge of Power&quot;. She even healed herself a little and that didn't keep her from getting out of the capture able zone! Plus..no haunt able to be used!<br /><br /> The other two pets she had with her were a snake and a squirrel.<br /><br />Also, if you do need to heal pets you can commence battle with her and then forfeit to heal them. Mine were dead for two minutes more so I just held her and then healed them, then battled away.<br /><br />I also used NPCscan to help find her, but beware, if you are around a player with her pulled out, it will still go off.

Every time that you engage a pet in battle it will randomly choose its skills. So you can keep forfeiting and battling it again until it has the <a href="/pet-ability=652/haunt">Haunt</a> ability.

Therefore she will suicide on you. Just keep forfeiting until she is level 19 or below, so she can only use the Haunt ability.<br /><br />Also, you don't want to use Unholy Ascension for leveling your little devil.

Finally caved to annoyance and bought a magical crawdad. <br /><br />Great support healer and awesome tank. <br /><br />So yea, for anyone having difficulty fighting this pet, run a couple of rounds with a crab on your team, youll generally scare away the val'kyr teams and can then go back to your other (more creative) teams. And if you have the gold, I highly recommend springing for the crawdad.<br /><br />Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>499650</b></h3>Caught one in Zul'Drak, middle spawn point. I found that setting up multiple alts, each at a different spawn point was the easiest way of finding her. I would randomly check each spawn point about once an hour or so. Some tips to catching her.<br /><br />If she has Unholy ascension as her third move she can (and usually will commit suicide). You can counter this by leaving battle, and re-engaging her. As long as you don't attack, she will respawn. If you have killed a pet, or one of yours has died then it will not, so be sure to check which move she has before fighting her.<br /><br />Terrible Turnip is your friend. Once you got her with Haunt, you will want to knock her down to low health quickly, and not kill her. With its self healing it can also take a pounding while you wait for the Haunt to end (if she used it).<br /><br />Any pet with death grip will be useful as well. When Haunt ends she returns to the back row. You can then Death grip her back out and try to catch her once more. **Note** If she uses Haunt and she is the last remaining pet the battle will automatically end. Try to leave at least one pet alive on the other side.<br /><br />Hope this helps, and good luck everyone.</div>

I put in a ticket to see if Blizzard would give me the pet, since I actually did capture it prior to the error (I even had a screen capture for proof), and they refused. According to them, the error was caused by one of the any number of addons I use. They said they can only restore a pet that has already been in your pet journal previously.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gatekus</b></h3>Thank you to all the amazingly generous and articulate people who posted important information regarding this pet. God bless you guys. In hours of searching, I only encountered two of these pets. Unfortunately, the Haunt/Unholy Ascension ability was not something I understood the first time I encountered her, and I lost the first pet because she killed herself. <br /><br />It is important to note that because of you all, when I encountered the second pet after further hours of searching, I knew what to do. Some of the following is paraphrasing what others have said, but it is important and bears repeating.<br /><br /><b><u>I recommend using an aquatic pet of at least level 23 with a self-heal ability to battle the Unborn Valkyr.</u></b> If she haunts your pet, you need to stay alive for 4 rounds, and that self-heal ability can make the difference on whether or not you capture her. Ironically, she also spawned (the second time) with a blue rare Squirrel as well, so <b>having a beast or mech to handle Critters is a good idea for your 2nd/3rd battle slots.<u></b><br /><br />After days of searching, when I finally encountered the second Valkyr, as much as my sweaty-palmed, heart-pounding state wanted to leap in and immediately battle/capture the second pet I encountered, I didn't. Instead, I inititated the battle and <u><b>IMMEDIATELY CHECKED HER THIRD ABILITY</b> </u>on the upper right hand screen. Sure enough, this pet had the <b>dreaded Unholy Ascension ability</u></b>, AKA Unborn Valkyr Suicide! <br /><br />I surrendedered the battle, then re-initiated. She still had Unholy Ascension. Back and forth I went three times until finally she switched her third ability to Haunt. Phew! I locked in the battle and captured her.<br /><br />I don't know if this information will help anyone, but the first pet I encountered was just south of Skorn in Howling Fjord; she was grey, and it was early morning, 6 AM. The second pet was in the northern Stormwright Shelf area of Sholozar Basin; she was green, and it was night, 9 PM. These encounters were six days apart. Neither appeared after a server restart or anything special. Dogged determination and a little piece of knowledge about checking her third ability will increase your odds of success. <b>All the best to everyone still searching. </b></div>

This made my day, I've been looking for her for months! <br /><br />Tip: Grizzly Hills and Howling Fjord are great places to circle around over and over to farm this little pet, because their area is smaller than the rest of the continent so its quick to get from one spawn point to another.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nulanna</b></h3>As of patch 5.4.8 this pet is not nearly as elusive as she was previously. Since the major rush is off of her spawn points, most of the points are no longer camped. I ran the Northrend loop about four or five times all told over the course of a week. Today I finally found, not one, but two (one poor, one uncommon) - I captured both - for the simple fact that at no point running my loops did I ever see a single person at these spawn points. Additionally, after capturing the uncommon, I originally left the poor one - and decided to go back about ten minutes later and she was still there. Since I appeared to be the only person still searching - I went ahead and took her. Long story short, I believe that, now that the major craze has died down - and everyone foaming at the mouth to get one of these most likely has it - if you are diligent daily about running the loop once or twice a day - you should have one fairly quickly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sierron</b></h3>Had looked for it a couple of times, saw guides and then camped. Looked for it at some spots in one zone with some pauses and then moved zone too. Found it in Dragonblight, near Wyrmrest Temple. But the unthinkable happened. My pet dragon killed it. But it got resurrected - and I was happy. Until it again died.. It was Uncommon quality and I believe lvl 22. So my hunt continues. So my advice - don't have some pets that's kinda OP, but keep one or two for the other pets with the Val'kyr.</div>

I forgot to add her to my NPC scan (that explains a lot) but I was using the &quot;Unborn Val'kyr waypoints for TomTom&quot; add-on (thanks aluopa!) so I had the points marked on my map. She had Unholy Ascension but I used an uncommon level 25 Emperor Crab (P/P)...dropped Whirlpool, then Surge (2x I think). She never popped Unholy and after Whirlpool hit, I was able to cage her. She was uncommon B/B, knocked down to level 20 at capture. Now to find a rare! Btw, it was snowing in The Storm Peaks at the time (I had just finished battling Arctic Fox Kit) so not sure if it was related. Good Luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Alkiphron</b></h3>So, I've actually battled the Unborn Val'kyr 3 times in only 2 days time. Pretty good luck, right? <b>WRONG</b>! I lost round one when I had all but 1 of my pets die to capture it, only to let the last lose to some random poor quality snake. Rounds 2 and 3 were the same: the Val'kyr pulled Unholy Ascension twice. I heard they nerfed the chance for the Val'k to cast that, but I guess not. Round 4 to be announced.<br /><br />ALRIGHT SO ROUND 4:<br />Found the Val'k, started battle, was feeling confident...<br /><i>Forgot to heal up my pets... RELOG</i><br />Round 4.5:<br />Log back in, battle her, capped her before I ate a haunt (used a Tundra penguin, they're awesome at tanking her)<br />Had the most intense battle versus 2 squirrels. Let's just say, my Imp ended the fight alone and with 243 hp<br /><br />Uncommon quality too. Don't have the heart to farm the rares, gl guys.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gracin</b></h3>So I really just got into pet battling this last week. Looking for the easiest path to 25, I followed a guide which lead my to Dragonblight to catch birds. As it so happens I stumbled upon a Unborn Val'kyr in the northern part of the zone. I had heard they were rare, but I wasn't in a position to attempt a catch, and after reading the struggles on Wowhead about catching I'm glad I left it.<br /><br />Flash forward a few days later, I'm working at getting pets rounded up for the Celestial Tournament and Beasts of Fable after having trounced the tamers of Azeroth and Pandaria. After some research into one fight it was suggested to have, you guessed it and Unbork Val'kyr. Now disappointed in myself for not even attempting a catch I added it to the bottom of my growing list of needed pets. I soon reached the end of that list and made my way around Borean(Nothing), Scholazar(Nada), Icecrown(Nope), Storm Peaks(Sigh...), and finally Zul'Drak.<br /><br />What's this I see at the Alter of Rhunok? An Unborn Val'kyr. I quickly pounce, not wanting to lose my opportunity to cross realm trickery. Knowing the horror stories of Unholy Ascension, I quickly glanced at my targets abilities. HAUNT! I swung first with my Tolai Hare's flurry, doing a nice chunk of critter damage. Not wanting to overdo it, I swapped to a level 8 Terrible Turnip to pass a little more damage with Weakening Blow before it was dispatched. I swapped into an Eternal Strider, and jetted the Val'kyr with two cold blasts from Water Jet to bring it down to capture territory. I throw. I miss. I throw again, begging to gods for some bit of luck... IT LANDS!<br /><br />Ok, so I'm elated, but now to deal with the not one but two rare Arctic Hare's accompanying my prize. I managed to handle them with easy and now here sits my beautiful, prized, Poor quality B/B Unborn Val'kyr. Thankfully I have an Undead Battle-Stone in my bags.<br /><br />Edit:<br />So I wrote this while I continued to fly from zone to zone, to the remaining spawn points I hadn't hit, just for ^&amp;*!s and giggles. I get to my very last spot north of Baelgun's Excavation Site in Howling Fjord and there floats another Val'kyr. I engage once again with the same team as before, this time she is a beautiful Rare B/B with Unholy Ascension. Thank you to all the comments that pointed out to forfeit and then try for Haunt, because it worked first go. I popped flurry twice from my Hare, threw three time before the Val'kyr was captured. Then I faced off against a Rare(I know right) Turkey, who finished my rabbit and nearly got my Strider. Fortunately, my Strider held on cooking that jive Turkey, and squashing the Poor Maggot that followed. Gotta say I'm pretty thrilled right now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>relictor</b></h3>My search started yesterday. I followed the TomTom coordinates round and round until finally, I came upon one in Icecrown. My eyes lit up as I engaged and started smacking her around. I kept throwing boxes at her but the sneaky wench was too quick, until finally she used Unholy Ascension and killed her self for her companions. Slightly annoyed, I stopped for the day.<br /><br />Today I hopped on at midday to continue my search. I literally went to every coordinate bar one in Zul'Drak, I flew to it without much hope. I became erect with happiness as I saw her icon light up on my minimap - I engaged! I made sure this time to look at her skills, to find she had unholy ascension in her skill list. I disengaged and restarted the fight a few times to ensure she was using haunt instead.<br /><br />It took me 5 traps to finally land her. I used a pet with a heal to ensure I lived through the beatings . To add to the pure joy I was feeling, the Random Number God was nice enough to also reward me with a Flawless Undead Battle-Stone. Some people have all the luck :)<br /><br />i.imgur.com/6MG38TD.jpg</div>

She had two easy squirrels with her and had no problem capturing her or defeating the others. <br /><br />I was flying to Zul'Drak (from Dal) on a transport when I saw one spawn on the ground (Insert heart attack now). Logged out fast so I could get to the nearest FP and fly back to the Unbound Thicket. Started the battle and got her!<br /><br />I used; Lil' XT (25), Mr. Bigglesworth (25) and Anubisath Idol (25)<br /><i><br />Oh, and for people who were wondering, like myself, she spawned by herself just like any other pet would.

What I would do is start a battle and then forfeit if the pet wasn't rare and then I would announce in general chat the location I found one at, I ended up make three people extremely happy who had been looking just as long as I had and each of them already had stones at the ready!<br /><br />Although finding this pet took me several hours over a span of a few days I ended up helping some people out who were looking and made a new friend along the way!<br /><br />Good luck to you all who are still looking and I hope you get one soon!</div>

This morning I put three of my four 90s at the three spawn points in Sholazar. With my main I went off into Draenor (before it fell apart, of course). Just check the three every so often. Anxiety doesn't help. Got back from work and checked the three--right there in front of me was a common. Northwestern spawn point.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1247477</b></h3>Got this beauty today at 12:02 pm server time, Area 52, Storm Peaks 65.2/ 41.8, and can confirm that previous posts suggesting checking the spots at the top of the hour seem to be the best time to catch them. I'll admit, I've been camping this one for some time, maybe a couple of months &amp; several times a day. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I found her &amp; began the battle that she was a rare! Happy hunting :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SirDraghar</b></h3>I found my first Unborn Val'Kyr way shortly after battle pets came out and caught her not knowing she was a bit of a pain to find. Just stumbled across her 'Oh, another un-captured pet, better grab it' <br /><br />Lately I've decided I want three of them, so last night I went out and caught two more.<br /><br />Just wanted to note a few things that might help those trying to catch her.<br /><br />- These pets spawn relatively quickly compared to what you would expect. I accidentally killed one last night, and caught two others and did a dungeon within an hour and a half.<br /><br />- As others specified, she seemly can only be active at one spot at once. Fly all over northrend, she'll probably be at one of the spawns. If you somehow check every spot, likely she was killed just before you started, check the full route again and you'll find her.<br /><br />- Running from the fight, and re-engaging WILL change her move-set. Basically, hover over her picture, if shes has the ability 'Unholy Ascension' she's suicidal, and you need to immediately leave that fight. Re-engage her until she has haunt instead.<br /><br />- Do NOT flee when she is dead from haunt, or she will not respawn.<br /><br />- Try to capture her before she haunts you, and do not let her be the last pet alive, as haunt will then be a suicide and end the battle.<br /><br />- Mind your crits, do not use an ability that hits '300-400' if she has 585 HP, you could end up losing her.<br /><br />If shes in the back row, or you're worried she might die if you hit her, just flee and re-engage so shes fully healed. Just be sure you check for 'Unholy Ascension' again if you do. This is how I lost the first one I found last night.<br /><br />First find was in the very south east corner of Howling Fjord<br />Second was in the west area of Crystalsong Forest.<br />Third was in south east area of Dragonblight.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Yalianna</b></h3>Just wanted to say thanks to everyone who posted the map coordinates. Had been looking for several weeks for my Unborn Val'kyr using the maps given here, but was beginning to be discouraged. Do not give up, you will find one eventually. I stuck to the spawn points listed on wowhead. I found mine in Howling Fjord @ 68.1, 67.8 coordinates at 11:30 am CST. I was on Illidan-US server, not sure if that matters because of cross-realm. I was also using a pet addon called Cancel Pet Fight in case she had unholy ascension ability first, just in case. The other two pets she had with her were a common rat and a turkey. I used 3 lvl 25 rares, darkmoon rabbit H/S, Strand Crawler H/H, and a Mirror Strider H/B, just in case I had to heal. Rabbit got her low enough quickly and easily to be caged, and she did not cast haunt, took four attempts to cage despite pristine trap. Turkey took the longest to kill due to aquatic pets. I thought maybe this might help someone. It also helped to have your pet team &quot;ready&quot; before hand so you don't kill her by accident or your pets get owned by her and her team. I used a pet team addon called PetBattle Teams, which lets you set up different teams ahead of time. This really helped me to be prepared when I did find her. I also had 3 characters in Northrend, covering a few zones, instead of flying one all over, so I just alternated checking their zones/spawn points, then if nothing, I'd switch to another one again. Good luck to everyone still looking. I hope this helps someone also.</div>

Keep jumping from point to point until you find it. It can take some time, just don't give up. It works, it just needs some patience.<br /><br />Just remember:<br /><br />1) if the Valkyr spanws with Unholy Ascension spell don't fight (abandon) and engage her again until it has the other spell<br />2) if you kill her don't panic: it's undead so it will resurrect with few hitpoints, allowing you an easy tame<br />3) use a pet that doesn't hit too strong</div>

Second fight she had Haunt, so I carried on.<br /><br />Used a 25 H/B rare Frog. Suggest a SINGLE Tongue Lash, followed by Frog Kiss until you get her in capture range. Even with about 7 rounds (with multiple fail traps), she didn't use Haunt at all, so even that was no problem.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: For those of you who use NPCScan, I can confirm it will no longer detect her. This is probably due to the changes in the detection schema used by the addon since 6.0. (since Blizzard changed the way rares are detected)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1434555</b></h3>After almost 2 months, I've <i>finally</i> captured my very own Unborn Val'kyr! I captured this beautiful little creature at the spawn point in the middle of Crystalsong Forest, nearest to Dalaran.<br /><br />When I engaged in battle with her, she had Unholy Ascension, but due to being on a high pop server (where I've seen people try to &quot;steal&quot; this pet from someone forfeiting to get the Haunt ability, or switch their pet, etc) I was too afraid to risk trying to get Haunt, so I took my chances. I figured if I could get her health down to the required amount to capture her in 5 rounds or less, I'd be good to go.<br /><br />I used my level 25 Celestial Dragon. Moonfired once, then used Roar until the trap box lit up. She was capturable at round 5. Took me 3 tries to catch her with the Pristine Trap.<br /><br />As soon as I caught her, I announced my new prize in guild chat, hearthed, and used the Undead Battle-Stone I'd been saving for her and upgraded her from Uncommon to Rare.<br /><br />This has been a great week on WoW for me! First I get the Onyxian Drake mount, then I get my Unborn Val'kyr. To everyone still trying to get her, don't give up! She's so worth it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1065597</b></h3>With 6.01 this is a very popular pet to hunt because of the garrison daily pet battles you can use it in. It is well mentioned in posts how this one is used in winning strategies (despite other strategies working as well) and so I have seen a large number of players flying the same waypoint locations a me while I hunted for the bugger.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and save some frustration in the hunting process for this one. Do not get tunnel vision on this as it could get frustrating. Do some pet leveling as are flying your routes. I stumbled across mine between two waypoint in HF (71.8x43.0 &amp; 68.2x67.6) I was a solid 500+ yards from either, nearly dead center between them. You could have knocked me over with a feather as the silly thing was a pet joining the battle when I challenged a rabbit. /facepalm a friggen rabbit... <br /><br />There is a random element to this that might be worth remembering when seeking this pet. I have spent countless hours flying myself all over heck looking for this bugger but let myself get tunnel vision.The waypoints might provide an increase in the chance to run across one, but if your only focusing on them you could be burning a lot of hours that could have been productive with other acquisitions of rares and leveling lower pets along the way. I would humbly suggest you have a little fun from time to time between waypoints to show the Northrend critter just who the boss is in the friggen north.<br /><br />Enjoy and good luck!</div>

Also, I got it down to around 400 health, and the next hit should have done around 340, putting it in a good capture range. Of course, CRIT.

I haven't seen her since that first loop for about 6 hours now. Although it's possible I just happen to be in the opposite zone when it re-spawns and someone takes it. It seems that it shouldn't be as difficult to spot as it is.</div>

No one cares about people posing with them. We're only here cause we want the information to catch one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Faceroast</b></h3>Got it this morning on EU-Grim Batol in Borean Tundra at 32.8,60.2 at 07:45. After I initially found her for the first time 4 days ago I panicked when she used haunt and (seemingly) killed herself. I forfeit the battle... after which she didn't respawn. So whatever you do, do not forfeit when she kills herself with Haunt. If you do she will not respawn. My mistake for not first looking in the wowhead comments, I slammed my face after I read this.<br /><br />Over the past 4 days whenever I had nothing else to do I made a full round over all the spawn points. Overall I would say I have flown about 10 full rounds of all spawn locations all over Northrend. Not that big of a deal but it does require some dedication as making the full route takes quite some time.<br />This morning I logged in and to my surprise she was sitting right at the spawn point where I logged out. <br /><br />She was common and had the Haunt ability. She didn't use Haunt once during the fight though. Watch out for her health, even the smallest hits can chop off quite a bit of health. <br />Overall wasn't a difficult fight, took 5 trap throws till I caught her. She had a bunny and a squirrel with her.<br /><br />Hope this helps. Good luck to anyone still hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Astarsia</b></h3>Not sure where my post is for this but i did manage to finally get this one in crystalsong forest. Poor quality. and i know some people have given suggestions on how to upgrade with drops of mobs, but never have any upgrade stones dropped since i've been playing and I farm pets a lot. So I'm so pleased that I discovered that the rewards you get in your garrison for fighting the daily pet battles gives you bind on account items which i pooled together from my 4 garrisons to upgrade this one. I also had a lvl 25 stone from the initial (new) quest you get from the pet lady in your garrison. So that saves a lot of time and effort.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JoyousOblivion</b></h3>Ok, apologies in advance, but is this still rare? I spent a couple minute tonight and caught one in Crytalsong forest. I checked the three Icecrowne spawn points but didnt see anything so went to crystalsong and it was in the middle one.<br /><br />First one had that unholy power so left battle and fought again and rather easily caught it with a panther cub and terrible turnip. It was uncommon quality.<br /><br />Is this thing still rare? Did it get more spawns, or for once am I just lucky in this damn game, lol? I don't really pet battle (this guy is my second highest level pet now) so not sure.<br /><br />No SS but it was caught shortly before 11pm EST at MIDDLE SPAWN POINT in CRYSTALSONG Forest.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>961381</b></h3>It took me around 10 hours of flying around Northrend solo using TomTom waypoints provided here by awesome users. Thanks for all the help via these comments. It's the biggest reason I even found one in the first place. I nearly killed the one I caught (panicked!) but RNG was on my side. It trapped the second try and the scorched earth didn't have a chance to murder my poor Valk. Woohoo! Basically, be careful and don't derp like I did! Have your pets healed and the right pets active when you engage this pet. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>93172</b></h3>I stumbled upon this battle pet completely by accident. I had an alt on a different server parked in storm peaks and was randomly checking it for snowstorms for an arctic fox kit (the last pet I need for Northrend Safari). <br /><br />I decided to give the group finder a chance to realm hop to find a snowstorm. The first realm I hopped to didn't have a snowstorm so I left the group and as I did I saw an Unborn Val'kyr flying right in front of me but then it phased out. I also noticed another player flying right over the spawn point and my heart started beating like crazy. <br /><br />I had to quickly find the exact same group I had joined to get that server again and joined group and phased back in to see the player still hovering! He was AFK! I clicked on the Val'kyr and engaged battle and noticed she had the suicide ability. In a panic I quickly left the battle and noticed the other player was dismounted watching me ready to steal the pet. I was able to click on it again and once again suicide ability! UGH! So I gave it a good 30 seconds to throw off the other player, left battle, reengaged and haunt! <br /><br />It was a close battle as I didn't have the best team built for it but I was able to capture a grey one! I know nobody cares about this but I'm posting it because I'm excited to finally have this battle pet. Now I need to level her to 25 and make her rare and I might be able to finish the rest of the cheevos.<br /><br />Edit: Right after posting this I realm hopped to find a snowstorm and got my arctic fox kit :) Tis a good day for a pet battle!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Biffsterr</b></h3>I tend to be pretty lucky with rares; this goes for mounts as well as hunter and battle pets. I got my third Unborn Val'kyr today in Storm Peaks near the Horde Camp Tunkalo. I got the first a few days ago in Sholazar near River's Heart and the second one the day after that in Borean Tundra near Bor'gorok Outpost. The first one was at 7:00 AM eastern on Friday. The second one was at 3:00 AM eastern on Saturday. The third was at around 10:30 AM eastern on Wednesday. Each of the three was done on a different toon. Two were rogues and the third was on a warrior; I don't play any of those three very much. They're basically profession toons.<br /><br />The only advice I can give you is to look for her at times when no one else is looking. I know, that may be difficult, especially on high population servers. I have enough toons that are 90+ that I can put one in each zone but that didn't necessarily help me, especially with the third one. I have a few 90+ toons on a low population server and when I seemed to encounter a camper at many different spawn points no matter what time it was on the high population server, I moved to the low population server, flew around to every spawn point. <br /><br />Almost the very last point, the one near Camp Tunkalo was where I found her. I only had one left to check. So, the point is that no one was out looking for her on the low population server and I was free to check every single one without competition. The first two were on my main server which is high population and it may have been my insane pure luck that I got two but I favor early morning and it works. Good luck and take comfort in knowing that you won't have me to compete with for her now.</div>

Within a day I had my Unborn Val'kyr and have seen several more, they do seem to despawn after a while if nobody captures one which can make things more frustrating.</div>

The points are closer together in these zones than in any other zone, so its easier to check those spots over and over, plus early in the AM there's less people around. I got all three of mine between 2am and 4am, one from each of the GH spawn points. <br /><br />Happy hunting!</div>

I knew that it was listed in Warcraftpets as the number one battle pet so I figured it was easy to get, and for me it was. Then I came here, heh.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MagusVivianne</b></h3>If you accidently deal a fatal blow to the Unborn Val'kyr <b>DO NOT WORRY</b> since she's undead she will be made invincible for 1 round. Surrender the battle while she's still alive and she will respawn near you. Be patient though I had to do this three times until being able to capture her and she takes up to a minute to respawn. <br />Sources: expierence<br />Good luck and be patient half of the process is luck :P<br />Have a great time with your new underling! <br />Edit*<br />And by respawn I mean after you have surrendered. She will be at the same location you surrendered. Hope this helps!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>w4rl0</b></h3>I have a few questions about this pet. I found mine and caught it but it was a poor quality. Is there only one in all of Northrend, Meaning that once one is found it takes a while for another to show up? I know this might sound silly/dumb to ask but I've been to every spawn point with no prevail.<br /><br />Location - <b>Zul'Drak</b> at 8:00 PM EST on Emerald Dream(US)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Graknak</b></h3>Gave up after a few full runs of the continent. It seems you either need a raid with 27 people to each camp a spot to make sure you find her because flying around from point to point checking spawns is insanely inefficient as with each spawn you have at worst 26/27 chance of <br />NOT finding one. Simply because you can't guarantee nobody else is farming them, especially from the opposite faction. Not to mention the double breed problem, the suicide skills and the respawn timer. Might've been doable if the respawn was instant. Currently not worth the effort unless you have no social life and/or a job or 26 friends who want to help you camp spawns without capturing it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1494764</b></h3>At approximately 02:47 12 Sept 2015 in Borean Tundra {80.79, 48.26} I became the very lucky, and and even prouder, owner of a level 19 Unborn valkyr (breed H/H). Here is how it happened:<br /><br />I had gotten up to &quot;see a man about a horse&quot; and decided to to test the macros the many other fine pet tamers have posted here regarding this <b>most excellent pet</b>. I wasn't planning on running the whole route. While flying over Borean Tundra I setup my pet team following the excellent advice in Oslem's post: Bandicoon (1,1,1), Cockroach (1,1,2), and Frostfur Rat (1,1,1), all Rare level 25 Critters). I wanted the cockroach's Apocalypse ability just in case the fight was a long one, but it was never used.<br /><br />At the spawn point between Unu'pe and Death's Stand I checked a green-paw print and it was a wild Unborn Val'kyr, spoiling for a fight. I started with the Bandicoon's Bite, but was not satisfied with the amount of damage, and switched to the Frostfur Rat and it's Stampede. This killed the Unborn Val'kyr, and after she performed her rebirth with minimum health, I was able to capture her on the first use of the trap. The other two pets were quickly killed (I think they were a rat and a crab) and I breathed a huge sigh of relief.<br /><br />Come to a fight prepared, and you will usually win, but pure,dumb luck is always helpful. My heart-felt thanks to everyone who has posted about this pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>NaraNara</b></h3>Emergkul - Kel'thuzad<br /><br />I literally just got it 10 minutes ago. I was flying through grizzly hills and I got it at the Northern spawn next to Thor Modan. She was accompanied by 2 skunks which were easy to take care of. I am now the proud owner of a lvl 20 common rarity Val'kyr. <br /><br />Kudos to the person who posted the maps with the nodes on them. If it wasn't for those I wouldn't of been able to find it so fast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Katakaia</b></h3>I'm curious; I've been doing loop after loop, and I only managed to see one Val'kyr. I engaged it and 2 seconds later was ganked. The Val'kyr was killed (not sure I did it or if it was a result of the guy ganking me), and I haven't seen another one since. Anyone know how long these pet's respawn timer is? Is it across all the spawn points in Northrend? Or is it individual?<br />Really bummed that I can be ganked in the middle of a pet battle.<br /><br />Update: I just got my Val'kyr! I'm sooo pumped. Been circling Northrend for the past couple of hours, realm hopping as I went. Finally decided to just park it at the spawn point just northeast of Valkrion and focus on hopping realms for a bit. I almost missed it, it blended into the snow so well. I heart stopped! It took me a sec to actually move. I landed, saw no one around and started the battle. No Haunt! Thank the Lord, I didn't have to worry about it trying to kill itself. Took a deep breath and went for it with my Frostwolf Ghostpup, and I only needed to try my trap once! So lucky! I didn't breath a sigh of relief until the total battle was over, but the two skunks were taken care of easily.<br />Keep at it everyone. You'll get yours too!</div>

Finally found it - ironically while heading to Dalaran to bind there and to my surprise saw it on the minimap at the spawn point south of Dalaran. <br /><br />I got so excited to see it that I rushed down and started the fight, only to realise I had not healed my pets (including a levelling pet) from the previous fight!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1071292</b></h3>I just got this baby after looking and looking and looking ALL DAY! I was seriously beginning to think (as I'm sure lots of others have before me) that she didn't freakin' exist and WOW was just playing a cruel joke LOL, if you haven't found her yet hang in there, you will, just takes lots of diligence. And hey, if it was easy to get then it wouldn't be so awesome when you do finally find her! Oh and for those of you who'd like to know how I did finally get her I used the add-on Cross Realm Assist from curse. I would join a realm and just go between the 3 spawn points in Howling Fjord rather than going to all of them (which I tried earlier today by the way and it takes forever to go to them all). But once I started using the CRA within 2 hours I finally got her at Howling Fjord 45.8 43.0. Anyways hope this helps some folks out, happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1577728</b></h3>I find this hilarious since I did not know until right now that she was such a rare, sought-after pet.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Unbeweaveable</b></h3>Found one this morning after about 10 min of looking near ICC, first time I have looked in about a year (gave up a while back). One thing I will say for this and anything else rare is due to the way CRZ works you have a much better chance of finding anything on a RPPVP realm (Emerald Dream, etc..) than a regular PVP realm and especially PVE realms. I play many different realms but on PVE realms nowadays you can't look for anything without seeing other campers everywhere. RPPVP realms are the only ones where you rarely see anybody out in the wilderness of old content and thus more rares and such...... Good luck.</div>

I had to abandon the fight about 4 times before she had Haunt instead of UA but eventually it all came up right. I used a Mac Frog with Tounge Lash and Kiss and I TL'd her once and then just kept hitting Kiss until she was low enough to capture. She never used Haunt. <br /><br />I have my Val'k!

It says Breeds: B/B, but this pet can be a H/H as well.<br /><br />H/H is the better one. The B/B version has a better ticking dot, but the pet is slow anyways, so you'd better go for H/H. You survive longer, so you might cast an extra spell. <br /><br /><b>Addon: Battlepet Breed ID (for the people that don't have it yet and want to know their breeds).</b><br /><br /> Breeds are for the real pet battlers like I am.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SkiRed</b></h3>For those who have 'sorted by Newest First', are looking for the way to get hold of your Val'kyr without all the doom and gloom mentioned below, here's what to do:-<br /><br />a.) Fly around Northrend until the Val'kyr appears on your mini-map. This took me about 10 minutes.<br />b.) If it's grey, great, it will be easier to battle.<br />c.) Fight, trap and win... enough said.<br />d.) Collect 15 <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=116415">Pet Charms</a> from either Battle Pet World Quests, Garrison Menagerie or other dailies.<br />e.) Buy a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=98715">Marked Flawless Battle Stone</a> from <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=98725">Lio the Lioness</a> for 15 Charms.<br />d.)

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sinestra139</b></h3>Have these become easier to get with the new expansion? I just spotted one randomly when questing with an alt in Stormpeaks. I bagged it - sadly a grey but easily upgradable with a battlestone. Then I was just idling in the spot and another appeared within 5 mins. Despite being a keen pet catcher I have never seen one in the wild before let alone caught it and then seen a second. Location was just outside the spider cave in Storm Peaks if you're interested.<br /><br />Also I can confirm that these are catchable when in their undead mode. I managed to kill this one and was cursing myself and then as an undead pet it resurrected and I managed to bag it in that round and it survived to become my pet. All smiles :).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aladrias</b></h3>I have a team of 3 Unborn Val'kyr called Lucinda, Lilyth and Ladashah. Many people forfeit when they see the team, but for those that stay, I find this strategy works very well:<br /><br />1. Lucinda uses <a href="/pet-ability=218/curse-of-doom">Curse of Doom</a> then spams <a href="/pet-ability=422/shadow-shock">Shadow Shock</a>. When she dies and comes back as immortal, she finishes up with <a href="/pet-ability=321/unholy-ascension">Unholy Ascension</a>.<br />2. Lilyth uses <a href="/pet-ability=212/siphon-life">Siphon Life</a> then <a href="/pet-ability=652/haunt">Haunt</a>. <br />3. Ladashah uses <a href="/pet-ability=218/curse-of-doom">Curse of Doom</a> and then <a href="/pet-ability=422/shadow-shock">Shadow Shock</a> and a final <a href="/pet-ability=652/haunt">Haunt</a> if Lilyth is alive again. <br /><br />At this point I just use what works at the time, if the other team isn't dead. This strategy means you can make use of all the Unborn Val'kyr's abilities which means you can end up with a stack of pain on the enemy. Fun!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shadowtyra</b></h3>First time i have ever looked for this pet, i found it. North of Icecrown.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>RealUnimportant</b></h3>I've been out of the game for a while &amp; just returned, and was doing some refamiliarisation in Northrend when I saw one of these appear. I was sure I'd caught all the available pets before my break, so I was surprised to see that it wasn't already in my collection. Sadly, it despawned just as I was making a team to attack it.<br /><br />I went back to the same spot again today (NW Icecrown) and lucky me, there it was again! So I caught it, and after reading this page I knew that the quality of the pet was much less important than actually catching it in the first place so the fact it was grey meant nothing to me. As I was reviewing its stats to determine the breed, I was astounded to see another respawn in the exact same place mere seconds later! Not wishing to look a gift horse in the mouth, I obligingly caught that one as well... And wouldn't you know it, it was grey as well. Ah well, can't have everything... But then I finally got around to comparing the stats, and it turned out that I'd miraculously captured one of each breed!<br /><br />I'm off to see if my luck holds out on some rare mount drops now! :-D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nachtblau</b></h3>A few weeks ago I managed to catch both breeds easily. I saw a Val'kyr at almost every other spawn point listed in the comments. The first I saw was at 73:64 Icecrown. I think it must have been around 6 am Dalaran realm time. I then flew to the other spawn points, and there was one at almost every other spawn point, I think always around 20 to 25 minutes later. The last one I saw was probably around 9:30.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Alechs777</b></h3>Hey! As I'm trying to obtain new Falcosaur mounts I've read maaany comments, and it turned out that this pet is very valuable. I made my way to old Dalaran, and headed Icecrown, but without luck. I found a poor quality one at 44. 43, I captured it but decided to try out more spawn points. I checked in Dragonblight and at the Forgotten Shore a rare quality Val'kyr was waiting. So I guess they can spawn at many places at once, or at least they do have a short respawn time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Scoobydeux</b></h3>One of the Unborn Val'kyr's moves is <i><a href="/pet-ability=652/haunt">Haunt</a></i>. If the Unborn Val'kyr casts <i>Haunt</i>, then for the duration of the <i>Haunt</i>, the Unborn Val'kyr &quot;is considered dead&quot;, but when the <i>Haunt</i> expires, the Unborn Val'kyr revives, with the same damage as it had when it cast <i>Haunt</i>. You cannot target the Unborn Val'kyr while she is dead to you during her <i>Haunt</i>, but if you wait it out, you can capture her when she revives. I captured mine this way. Don't finish off the last of the other pets while the Unborn Val'kyr is Haunting; pass your turn(s), if you need to, until she revives. <br /><br />On the other hand, Unborn Val'kyr lists <a href="/pet-ability=321/unholy-ascension">Unholy Ascension</a> as an ability; if she has this in her active moves list and casts it, she dies. Unless you go first and cage her that round, she's gone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Empy3</b></h3>Instead of having one spawned in the entirety of Northrend at a time, as of 7.0 these now always have one spawn up per zone. Since each zone only has 3 spawn points, it's very easy to find one now. Crystalsong Forest seems to be the best place to get one quickly, since the zone is smallish and the spawn points are therefore relatively close together. That said, the maps of spawn points on Wowhead are not great. Crystalsong has a third spawn point in the southwest. I would recommend looking on Warcraftpets to get better ideas of the spawn points.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>remid0d0s0</b></h3>Yeah, they are apparently no trouble to capture now. So I recommend you go capture them! They are so handy for pet dungeons etc. and extras won't hurt.<br /><br />Just capture some gray or any quality, stone them to rare, and level them up from 18 as is convenient.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>fancysox</b></h3>I have horrible luck when it comes to mount drops, but incredible luck with battle pets, apparently. I caught my first Unborn Val'Kyr in the summer of 2015 after searching for 2 days (common). I caught my second one after seeing one randomly while doing Argent Tournament dailies about a year and a half ago (uncommon). I just caught my third Unborn today, again, while doing Argent Tournament dailies (uncommon). This one was where the Chillmaw daily is.<br /><br />I actually put a lot of thought in naming my happy little trio of Unborns. They are &quot;The Sisters of Death&quot;: Harbinger, Paroxysmus, and Stormageddon. Harbinger, a signal of a future event, foreshadow. Paroxysus, a sudden outburst or explosive event. Stormageddon, my first Unborn, just because I've loved that name ever since I heard it on Doctor Who. <br /><br />Death is coming (Harbinger). Death's wrath is upon you (Paroxysmus). The end of everything (Stormageddon).</div>

I was on my hunter so I decided to go check on <a href="/npc=33776/gondria">Gondria</a> over in good ol' Zul'Drak as she was the last major WotLK hunter pet I needed. Sure enough there was a rare B/B Valkyr at (75,22) and Gondria was found at the last waypoint on my way back to the flight master. <br /><br />As Ice Cube would say, &quot;Today was a good day.&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MuratSirin</b></h3>I was looking for a <a href="/npc=32517/loquenahak">Loque'nahak</a> to kill for the <a href="/achievement=2257/frostbitten">Frostbitten</a> achievement. Around 58, 21 in Sholazar Basin, saw this little pet. Thought it is cute and got it. I don't know if it is rare or not but the fact that i've never seen it, i think it's rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>holykhaos</b></h3>Just checked all noted spawn areas. I have the say that Sholazar Basin is the most productive. Found 3 within five minutes. All common quality.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>grigorigo</b></h3>Did blizzard buff this, or is simply no one interested in this anymore ? I literally found 2 Unborn Val'kyrs on my very first zone. I went to borean tundra and got 2 of them in 10 min.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Liltuscany</b></h3>I found her, then accidentally killed her. Will she respawn on same map, or do I have to leave the area altogether? Iâ€™m heartbroken.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>vikascollection</b></h3>Found mine using the top rated macros. After going to the 3rd waypoint, /way Zul'Drak 57.0, 39.8 it was there. Unsure if spawn chance has increased or changed since other patches. She brought two friends. An all critter team worked well</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jimmyv9</b></h3>FINALLY got one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Megiia</b></h3>I recomend getting this pet as soon as new patch hits, since I ended up finding one as soon as I reached the first point. Barely any people farming one a patch day so it was rly easy.. I ended up seeing two one after the other by a chance cuz I was passin thru another spawn point.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ehayen</b></h3>I have spent hours and hours hovering around spawn points in different zones, for decades, trying to find this pet.<br /><br />Eventually I just gave up.<br /><br />But then, one day, I was in Howling Fjord on a completely unrelated journey to tame an old elite bear, and there it was.<br /><br />It just showed up randomly and I tamed it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>helmaks</b></h3>I found her at <div class="quote-box">/way #120 65.2 41.8 Unborn Val'kyr</div> , but she sadly killed herself and I abandoned battle without knowing she would despawn.<br />I figured she might follow set spawn point and went to <div class="quote-box">/way #120 29.0 51.4 Unborn Val'kyr</div> where she was, not sure if I was just lucky :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>valentin25</b></h3>I thought this would be a bear to find but got two within 20 minutes using the coordinates posted.</div>

In this case Unborn Val'kyr. Before you kill it, just make sure the battle pet you are trying to catch can't be one of the two pets that can join the fight (ie 2:nd and 3:rd pet that joins the pet battle).<br /><br />I usually initiate a pet battle and check what battle pets are present and just forfeit the battle if none of the pets are to my liking or I need to heal up before the real fight. Unless you kill or catch one of the pets, you can always forfeit the battle, heal up again and then rejoin the battle and the same pets will still be there. Doing it like this usually speeds up the search for the specific battle pets you want unless you just want to fight for the XP. <br /><br />Personally I don't care about the quality of the battle pets since you can always use a <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=92741/flawless-battle-stone">Flawless Battle-Stone</a> (or the family specific ones) to upgrade the battle pets to rare quality. Flawless Battle-Stones are easy to get doing World Quests or just by buying them with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=163036/polished-pet-charm">Polished Pet Charms</a>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>in2it</b></h3>I just wanted you to know that I caught a Unborn Val'kyr (B/B) in Grizzly Hills today.<br /><br />I play on European servers, in this case Earthen Ring (RP server). I started the fight at 13:18 server time (CET, 1:18 pm). The Unborn Val'kyr was level 21 and as I said BB breed. <br /><br />I was personally wondering if it would be better to catch a Unborn Val'kyr at evening or at night but I caught it pretty much in the middle of the day.<br /><br />I already had two Unborn Val'kyrs HH breed that I caught many years ago, I just wanted to complete the collection with the BB breed. I actually also caught my HH breeds in Grizzly Hills way back when.<br /><br />I caught the BB breed at these coordinates 79.4 51.8.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tomtom" rel="nofollow">TomTom</a> (addon) Waypoint/Coordinates:<br /><br />/way #116 79.4 51.8 Unborn Val'kyr</div>
