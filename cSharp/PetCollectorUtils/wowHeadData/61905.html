<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pokeprof</b></h3>Among the <b>Battle Pets</b> in the game, The Lost of Lordaeron has a Unique model to itself alone. No other pet as of Patch 5.2 has the same model in this game, which makes it even more interesting consider it's an easy to get low level pet in the Forsaken Starting zone. It is also has the honor of being the Lowest Obtainable Undead Pet in the game through pet battles. As of yet, though, I have not seen even one other player, Alliance or horde, grab one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1038667</b></h3>Server time - 1:44am. Flew to Deathknell, the starter zone in Tirisfal Glades for undead, at the very north point by the crypt. 10 of these guys around. 4 battles, and rare tagged and bagged.<br /><br /> Rare - 158hp , 12 power, 10 speed. (undead creature) <br /><br />Contrary to the journal notation, apparently these guys do appreciate some company. Just dead company.<br /><br /> *Edit* Just flew through the zone. There's a lot of these guys around. So it may be that these are one of the time specific mobs? Not too certain the difficulty others have had, if any, with obtaining one of these guys. But the zone is littered with them at this moment. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>597835</b></h3>lvl 1<br />158<br />12<br />10<br />rare</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sweetieheart</b></h3>Farmed the rare for about 3 hours, this included killing other critters. Received numerous uncommon, about 20+, more than poor quality. After I received 1 rare I continued battling to level it, and capturing for achievements. The next two Losts I battled were rare, after that I lost count. I know it likely doesn't matter, but all my rare captures were around the zepplin tower and Brill.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Clankio</b></h3>This pet sounds very OP with 2 attacks that heal and Curse of Doom. Anyone can confirm this or is the damage on Absorb and Siphon Life low enough to not make this pet not super OP?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sospitatrix</b></h3>With an alliance character i went to get this one in Tirisfal Glades, only to get one-shotted by an lvl 95 guard.. When I was at the graveyard it was right in front of me... But it was a poor one, cute though. Because I had to get an undercity rat anyway, I tried to get a better one in Undercity. It took me some time to get a rare one, but there were plenty outside of Undercity to choose from :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MIMP</b></h3>I was trying to catch a rare one of these as an alliance character and eventually did. I decided to create an undead character to make life easier for getting the Undercity Rat and Undercity Roach. Upon making my new character there were tons of these to be had in the undead starting zone. Save yourself some effort and create a new character to obtain this, it's worth the effort. (Doesn't even have to be on your main realm, the pets are account wide.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cantralian</b></h3>Flew all over the zone and found none until I went by the two derelict windmills at 50 43 - there were three spawned there. First was a poor, second was an uncommon, so I left the third for someone else.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thecanman</b></h3>Use the following abilites:<br />- Absorb<br />- Siphon Life<br />- Curse of Doom<br />Use the first two to drain tank the opposition and the last one as the nuke to end all nukes. Those with humanoid pets, watch your back.<br /><br />This lil' fella has lots of potential from level 20 onwards. Looking forward to getting him there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kaushik</b></h3>NOT a rare pet. 2/11/2013. Found about a billion on the grounds of undercity. And this is coming from Blackrock Horde server, one of the most densely populated servers in WoW.<br /><br /><b>Note: this pet does not spawn in undercity per se (Meaning you dont have to take the elevator, underground, to where the undead people are), but in the grounds surrounding the castle and even beyond the walls of the castle.</b> Also numerous spawn locations around Tirisfal Glades. <br /><br />Took me about 30 minutes to find 3 rares.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rj23</b></h3>Maybe it's just bad luck on my part, but I have over 400 pets. Mostly rares, because I like pet battling so I don't mind multiple fights to find my rare. This was one of the hardest rares for me to obtain! If I had to hazard a guess it took me over 50 fights to find a rare one, but I did it and you can too!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>idahomike</b></h3>The very first one of these I battled ended up being a rare. Found in a graveyard just outside Brill (59,47). Battled about 10 more to see if I could get a rare of the other breed available...no such luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>geekygirlish</b></h3>Ran into one lvling a pet around the Bulwark, it was a trash one, but thought &quot;this is cute!&quot; I like his little ghosty icon. So set out to capture one. Found a bunch in the Balnir Farmstead graveyard and the fields surrounding. All the ones I killed around the farm were trash, but the graveyard ones were rare and uncommon so I snagged some. Might be a coincidence, but I continued killing them to lvl my other pet and all the ones in the gy were uncommon or rare. The others on the farm poor or uncommon</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>slfisher</b></h3>As of patch 5.4.8, pending the WoD update, you can still catch a rare quality among the Ruins of Lordaeron. I used the rats to level my lower level pets while waiting for a rare quality to spawn. I actually caught 2 rare quality Rats while doing this, but no rare Lost of Lordaeron's. Eventually, I started killing all rats and any critter spawns to speed up the spawns. This had almost an immediate improvement, I found a rare Lost within 10 minutes versus the hour or so I spent before (though I did catch 2 rare quality Rat's, as I mentioned earlier). <br /><br />Kill any rat spawns and critter spawns within the Ruins. <br /><br />I also used Speedy to kill these quickly with taking very little damage.</div>
