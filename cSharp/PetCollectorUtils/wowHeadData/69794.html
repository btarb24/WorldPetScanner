<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SpiderBrush</b></h3>Has anyone found one better than poor quality? I have found several of these, but they have all been poor quality.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tsahil2clarg</b></h3>Yeah I can't find any of these on the Island. Will they show up at honored or revered with the Sunreaver Onslaught? Will killing pets around the island get one to spawn? And do they spawn as secondaries? I've fought several pets on the island and none of these has shown up yet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Simples</b></h3>I name thee Shocodile!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sumskittles</b></h3>From what i can determine from farming this for 2 days for a rare, seems to only spawn after midnight on server-time. I couldnt find him anywhere at all on the island period until after midnight on the realm time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bahthalend</b></h3>If they ever put in a grown up one of these i desperately hope it's tameable.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1070835</b></h3>Confirmed sighting &amp; capture around 53 , 59. I don't know how to add pins on the map, so if someone could do that it would be lovely. Thank you :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Stalyn</b></h3>When I first looked at the new pets the island had, I was <i>shocked</i> to see two awesome lightning pets that I hadn't seen yet, this one and the <a href="/npc=69648/thundertail-flapper">Thundertail Flapper</a>. When I saw one had spawned north of me on the minimap, I dashed quick as lightning to catch it, and luckily no one else noticed this great pet before I did!<br /><br />I couldn't believe how often I saw this guy after waiting so long to see him the first time! What a load of <i>croc</i>! You can usually find them northeast/east of the Court of Bones (I've seen him spawn in more places than Wowhead has recorded, atm). Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SFFCorgi</b></h3>I had no problem finding these, most often around the 'front' (SW) end of the Diremoor. They're in and out of the pools. Secondaries include the other Isle battle pets, rats, shrine flies, spiders, silky moths and cockroaches in the usual sort of distribution -- one cockroach was a Rare.<br /><br />What problem I <i>did</i> find was finding a Rare primary, and got none this session. Uncommons were not too difficult, and I kept one of those. There's only one breed that seems to be coming up for these guys, and that's B/B.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SFFCorgi</b></h3>I found these all over Diremoor, I've submitted my data - why hasn't the map updated?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Googles</b></h3>Caught a rare quality one in the wild. Saved myself a Battle-Stone :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bweeda</b></h3>It appears this pet has been &quot;nerfed&quot; His Blood in the Water now shares a power spot with Paralyzing Shock, no longer giving him 2 big burst powers :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>223389</b></h3>Excellent pet for aiding in leveling pets in Valley of the Four Winds. Use <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=803">Rip</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=423">Blood in the Water</a>, and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=538">Devouer</a>. 2-3 attacks to kill Critters and Devour will keep him healled up. Bring a Raven/Crow to take care of Aquatics if needed.<br /><br />It has replaced my Feline Familiar for this task.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DawnSeven</b></h3>Why does this map suck so bad? There's way more than one, and they don't appear (to me anyway) to be secondaries. Soooo... ? I've been running around Diremoor as people have suggested, but if these are somewhere else too it would be nice to know.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MRTF</b></h3>Out of all crocolisks this is the coolest imo. It has also a very flexible move set, which makes it even more awesome! Shame it comes in 1 breed only.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>681718</b></h3>I have only found these guys in the 47, 46 (diremoor) range. I don't know if someone was out there battling too, someone was being a jerk or if the WoW Gods were angry. I also only found poor quality pets whereas my husband was rewarded with a rare quality off the bat. If you come across anything higher than poor then thank the WoW Gods!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Varemis</b></h3>Just found one at /way 48.64 45.83</div>
