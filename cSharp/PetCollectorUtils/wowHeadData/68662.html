<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>brothernads</b></h3>For those wondering about the drop rate, Blizzard recently posted a little more detail. CM Brennvin said the following on a forum post (I added the bold font):<br /><br />&quot;We believe there was a lot of confusion when we originally announced this change and we're certainly at fault for said confusion. The original patch note was very vague to the point of being misleading. It was never our intent to weaken old raid boss encounters to allow anyone to have a chance to solo them, regardless of class, spec, or skill. <br /><br />What we did change were encounters that were mechanically impossible for one person to accomplish, solely for the purpose of ensuring players have easier access to the hunt for the new rare companion pets -- <b>the drop rates of which are actually set to account for a group of three players, not one.</b><br /><br />Moving forward, though, we do not plan to adjust encounters for tougher raid bosses to be soloâ€™able by all classes and specs.&quot;<br /><br />(Source: <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7199913648?page=3#58" rel="nofollow">http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7199913648?page=3#58</a>)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>122154</b></h3>This pet is an AMAZING solo against <a href="/npc=68464/whispering-pandaren-spirit">Whispering Pandaren Spirit</a> and <a href="/npc=66738/courageous-yon">Courageous Yon</a> if you use <a href="/pet-ability=299/arcane-explosion">Arcane Explosion</a>, <a href="/pet-ability=611/ancient-blessing">Ancient Blessing</a>, and <a href="/pet-ability=802/ravage">Ravage</a>. Fight the critter/moth first for the Air Spirit, and the bird for Yon first. The key is to do as much damage as possible to the backline pets while keeping Ancient Blessing on cooldown to keep yourself healed. If the pet you're fighting is about to die, you can use Ravage for some healing. For Yon you won't do as much damage, but the Air Spirit, with a little bit of luck, is the easiest fight ever with Chrominius.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mormolyce</b></h3><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=362">Howl</a> + <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=593">Surge of Power</a> = bye bye birdie. He is also Dragonkin, so Flying pets are weak against him. The only downside is the two rounds of vulnerability after the Surge.<br /><br />He also has a main attack that's strong versus Critters, so if you're facing a team with a Flying and a Critter, look no further.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AtroposZ</b></h3>With the 5.3 buff to the Fabled Beasts dailies, this little guy is my go-to pet. Howl, Bite, Surge of Power = at least half dead NPC. I use him 8 out of 10 fights (the only ones I dont use him for are Nitun and No-No )<br /><br />He didnt used to be very expensive, Im not sure if that changed post 5.3 when the Sunlight/Life Exchange tactic was nerfed. Even so, he is well worth it if you dont want to spend an inordinate amount of time killing the NPC Beasts at 30-50 damg a round. Level him, use him, love him :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>223389</b></h3>Good for leveling yours pets in Valley of the Four Winds. With strong attack against critters, heal on 3 round cool-down, and heal on killing, this pet will last for ever. Huge health pool helps too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Fatnub</b></h3>Highly recommended for fighting legendary pets in pandaria. If you start out using him, you can almost always get a guaranteed 1k damage in from howl + surge of power. The 2 round cd after that doesn't really matter, since he'll probably be dead in the 3rd round anyway.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thecanman</b></h3>Howl + Surge of Power combo will <b>ONE SHOT</b> most non-arcane regular pets, and bring the tougher ones to about half or one-third health. This makes him great for taking out the Beasts of Fable, as well as the Pandara Pet Tamers.<br /><br />A word of warning when using this trick, though: Beware of pets with abilities which make them unattackable. Abilities like Burrow, Lift-Off or Dive will cause this ability to be a guaranteed miss. And even if it misses, you still need to spend the next two rounds recharging, meaning you'll give your opponent 2 free attacks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ArgentSun</b></h3><i>Very </i>powerful against the Beasts of Fable, especially as a second pet. Choose a pet with abilities strong against the particular Beast of Fable you want to defeat for your team's starting pet, and make sure you summon Chrominius second. Your first pet will probably do between 15% and 35% of the legendary's health before it dies. Chrominius's Howl &gt; Bite &gt; Surge of Power (against anything but Critters) or Howl &gt; Ravage (x2) (against Critters) will finish it off most of the time.<br /><br />This is a particularly powerful strategy because of the Dragonkins' passive ability and Chrominius turn as a second pet. The empowered Bite (or the first turn of Ravage) will usually bring the enemy pet to below 50% health, which will make your next attack <i>even more </i>powerful.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>IhaveNoLife</b></h3>I'm surprised no one has mentioned this, but his flavor text is a reference to his namesake's ability, <a href="/spell=23310/time-lapse">Time Lapse</a>. Back in the day (well, it still exists today, but I doubt many people even realize it), Chromaggus would have two out of a pool of five breaths that were randomized weekly. Among them was Time Lapse, which was considered to be the hardest breath mechanic to deal with, and any guild would be relieved when they didn't have to deal with it. Thus, this pet's flavor text.<br /><br />Incidentally, Blizzard didn't actually get the spell name quite right in the flavor text, referring to it as 'Time Stop' instead of 'Time Lapse'.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>forgottenring</b></h3>This guy is a great team destroyer once you get <a href="/pet-ability=299/arcane-explosion">Arcane Explosion</a>. Combine that with <a href="/pet-ability=362/howl">Howl</a> (or <a href="/pet-ability=611/ancient-blessing">Ancient Blessing</a>) and <a href="/pet-ability=802/ravage">Ravage</a>, he will tear through entire teams solo. Pairing him up with any crab and <a href="/pet-ability=511/renewing-mists">Renewing Mists</a> gives some extra passive heals if you meet an annoying pet like an undead, mechanical or a pet with <a href="/pet-ability=283/survival">Survival</a>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Grindlebell</b></h3>I had problems getting this pet to drop. Ran x 5 alts all over 100 each day for for a few weeks. I decided in desperation today to not loot any of the bosses because I always looted the pets off them (to later delete them because I had them all), not only didnt I loot I skipped the dragons completely and when I did this the chrominius pet dropped. Ok I could have just got lucky but what a coincidence. I wonder if no loot and no pets looted upped my rng chances? If your frustrated its worth a try because it worked for me.</div>
