<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>223389</b></h3>There is a CRZ trick I discovered with these:<br /><br />1) Bind a key to macro &quot;/target Cogblade Raptor&quot;<br />2) Bind a key to Interact with Target<br />3) Take taxi to Area 52 <br />4) Take taxi to Toshley's Station (sorry Alliance only)<br />5) Before you're about to land, use your target keybind (or you can manually target) the Raptor that's on the landing pad area.<br />6) Press your key bound to &quot;Interact with Target&quot;<br /><br />You'll enter the fight, but when you win (after capturing!), you'll be in a weird state like your flying mount is now the taxi. After moving for a few seconds, I got D/C'ed.<br /><br />What is happening is that your CRZ change over doesn't occur until after your taxi lands. So you have a short window of opportunity.<br /><br /><b>Update</b>: Because CRZ state can vary among servers and may even change dynamically, The next paragraph states the conditions that must be met for this technique to work.<br /><br />Blade's Edge Mountians (which contains Toshley's Station) must be zoned out on your realm and the origin of your taxi must be in a different realm. You'll know the conditions are correct when the taxi flies over and you see lots of green paws, then when you land, the paws disappear. If Area 52 doesn't work as a origin, try a taxi from different zone.<br /><br />Before trying this, It's helpful to test the CRZ state with your flying mount. Note the presence or lack of the &quot;CRZ noise&quot; at the zone boundary that indicates a zone change.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thae</b></h3>Caught mine at 68,65 right on Scalewing Shelf. It was level 19, so bring appropriately leveled pets for that. It looks very out of place and if you don't see any, you might wonder if you are looking in the right spot. I was starting to think I was looking in the wrong place, but around ~1:15pm server time on the weekend I found one so just keep looking.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1039696</b></h3>A tip for Horde farmers: These will spawn inside Toshley's Station itself. Most of the guards are around level 70, but there are level 90s as well. Be careful!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1039696</b></h3>Timing seems to be everything with these guys. I sent an alt to Toshley Station and searched for an hour while I did laps around the loop and mined, to no avail. I logged off for about an hour and looked for other battle pets on other alts.<br /><br />When I came back, they had started spawning. They didn't appear to all spawn in one wave, either. Instead, I was able to do laps and saw two or three per lap for about five circuits around. Took me about 10 battles to find a rare. (And after getting my first one, I called out in General to see if anybody needed one, so I could Alt-F4 out of a non-rare to save it for them, just in case. Be kind!)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1036203</b></h3>Im gonna tame one and name it Robo, after my toy Roboraptor</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wilosoft</b></h3>Went through 35 raptors and none was a rare... oh well I'll keep on searching...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>223389</b></h3>Anyone have any luck farming these guys for <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=92680">Flawless Mechanical Battle-Stone</a>? This is the most desired family for me to upgrade.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1072085</b></h3>I found mine at 64.00 64.73 - only one in the area at the time and it was of poor quality.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>thesponge</b></h3>I really think they need to get rid of the effect CRZ has on battle pets... It does phase them out for certain people. I tested what asherkobin said and he was right. 5 seconds after I landed all raptors disappeared. Ive been trying to use my interact hotkey fast enough but each time I fail by millaseconds. This makes it extremely hard to find certain long or rare spawn battle pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1076296</b></h3>I didn't manage to do the macro trick, but flew clockwise around the thorny bit that shows on the map harvesting leather, and when I got behind Toshley's Station I found 2-3! Managed to get the first one- it's common (started at level 19, now is level 17), but I'm happy with that for now! <br /><br />My fighters are:<br />level 19 moonkin hatchling<br />level 18 oozeling <br />level 18 squirrel</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>maely</b></h3>At 341 speed, this guy is a fairly devastating mechanical pet. His low attack power is countered by Exposed Wounds, and his low HP is countered by his mechanical racial. At 341 speed and with a speed-increasing move in the middle slot, he is almost guaranteed an attack every turn. The mechanical resurrection often leads to getting in an extra Batter for 600+ damage or putting Exposed Wounds on the enemy's pet for your next pet in line to finish off.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mormolyce</b></h3>One of the coolest models in the game, and it's just on a regular world battle pet hanging around one TBC zone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sharang2</b></h3>I have spent around 90 minutes farming these (10:00pm to 11:30pm) looking for a rare; I had seen one around fifteen minutes in that was rare but I unfortunately didn't bring enough muscle and failed to capture it. I have fought 20 others; and have seen only the one rare. For the last 20 minutes (11:13 to 11:30pm) I have not seen any spawn, and the only remaining ones are in the Alliance camp. I'm a level 66 Horde; so I can't get those. I'm definitely not seeing a 10-12 minute respawn time, however.<br /><br />Is it possible that the reason more won't respawn is because two or three are alive in the Alliance town?<br /><br />Edit: 9 minutes after initially posting, two more spawned. It appears they may be on something closer to a 30 minute spawn timer, although again this may be influenced by the 3 tucked away in the Alliance town.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jerkymonkey</b></h3>I came to Blade's Edge Mountains looking for both the Cogblade Raptor and the Scaled Basilisk Hatchling. After flying around Toshley's and Scalewing Shelf looking for about an hour and finding none, I decided to throw in the towel and head north to look for the Scaled Basilisk (roughly /way 73 19). <br /><br />I found a ton of the Basilisks wandering around, battled about 5 of them catching one for my collection, and I went back in search of the Raptor. Upon arriving in the Raptor spawn area I promptly found 3 Cogblade Raptors roaming around. I hope this helps anyone who is having trouble finding one.<br /><br />Edit: I followed this pattern 3 times, and got a rare on the third iteration.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1319706</b></h3>A lot of people have mentioned the 2-3 spawning at a time thing, but I didn't see that--when I farmed, there were at least 8-10 all at once along the shelf. I can't speak to respawn rate (low-pop server) but every time I checked there was either plenty of them or someone actively farming.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SolidSnack</b></h3>While hunting for a S/S breed one, I managed to get a flawless mechanical battle-stone!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bomigabster</b></h3>I love this little guy!
