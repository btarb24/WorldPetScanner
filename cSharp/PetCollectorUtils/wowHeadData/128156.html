It is a non-cageable level 1 that comes in P\/B (mine was rare). It will run around very fast & there will be competition so you should come prepared. \n\nFirst, make sure you have a battle pet with an ability that cannot reduce the opponent's health below 1, like [url=https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/pet-ability=826\/weakening-blow]weakening blow[\/url] or [url=https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/pet-ability=1357\/superbark]superbark[\/url] (I used [url=https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=63365\/terrible-turnip]Terrible Turnip[\/url]). This is important because the yeti will have extremely low health and anything you do with a level 25 will almost certainly kill it.\n\nSecond, make sure you make a macro to target [ \/tar globe yeti ] and make sure your Interact with Target key binding is set to [F1]. I put my macro on the second actionbar, and in slot 3 so that it would be close to F1 on my keyboard. This is important because you not only need to target the yeti right away, but interact with it immediately. It'd be a shame if you target it first but another player interacts before you do!\n\nLastly, position yourself inside the tree at ground level and start spamming your target macro around the time you think the yeti might appear.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Malfurix</b></h3>It spawns in the snow globes and start running pretty fast. You have to battle the yeti to capture it. Mine was level 2 and alone in battle. I had a terrible turnip in my team with weakening blow to make sure not to kill the yeti. Good luck hunting, it's not cageable.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dinamitas</b></h3>Only one yeti spawns at a time. If there are more people waiting, you can easily get it doing this:<br />Stand in the middle of the globe (inside the tree);<br />Create macro with /tar globe yeti;<br />Spam your macro and your interact with target key bind.<br />What this does is as soon as he spawns you go into pet battle mode before you can even react it spawned. Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>GraciaSkyrogo</b></h3>Took 35min to spawn in the Orgrimmar globe in QuelÂ´Thalas server.<br /><br />HE IS LEVEL 1, NOT 25. avoid going with strong pets or you will oneshot him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nerdjitsu</b></h3>This battle pet spawns one at a time about once every 30 minutes inside the snowglobe located in IF and Org during the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/feast-of-winter-veil-guide">Feast of Winter Veil</a>. It is a non-cageable level 1 that comes in P/B (mine was rare). It will run around very fast &amp; there will be competition so you should come prepared. <br /><br />First, make sure you have a battle pet with an ability that cannot reduce the opponent's health below 1, like <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=826/weakening-blow">weakening blow</a> or <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=1357/superbark">superbark</a> (I used <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=63365/terrible-turnip">Terrible Turnip</a>). This is important because the yeti will have extremely low health and anything you do with a level 25 will almost certainly kill it.<br /><br />Second, make sure you make a macro to target and make sure your Interact with Target key binding is set to . I put my macro on the second actionbar, and in slot 3 so that it would be close to F1 on my keyboard. This is important because you not only need to target the yeti right away, but interact with it immediately. It'd be a shame if you target it first but another player interacts before you do!<br /><br />Lastly, position yourself inside the tree at ground level and start spamming your target macro around the time you think the yeti might appear. Don't forget to keep your other finger over F1 so you can click it as soon as the target locks!<br /><br />Special thanks to Sparanoid, Dinamitas and insectKR, whos comments helped my nab mine on the first try :)<br />edited: fixed breed, macro</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Arcardy</b></h3>I got mine from the Realm Zirkel des Cenarius (EU). It spawned at 23:57, so the spawn times are already a mess (it will spawn every thirty minutes). It will run in circles through the snow globe (in orgrimmar or ironforge. In orgrimmar, the globe is near to the flight master at the upper stage). It has the green pet-symbol (a little claw) over it's head and if you left-click the yeti, you will start the fight.<br />It's not tradeable (because you can't put it in a cage). Make sure to use a pet with <a href="/pet-ability=1357/superbark">Superbark</a> or simmilar abillities (if your pet has a high level), because the yeti is level 1!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bomigabster</b></h3>Dinamitas technique below worked perfectly for me. Several other people were waiting in IF (none as long as me so I'm glad I caught him, I'd already missed one) and I don't think they even realised he had spawned and been caught. Luckily he was a blue so they do exist! Spawned just over 40 minutes after the last one was caught. First I saw was 4:12 p.m, the one I caught was 4:54 p.m.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Malachi68</b></h3>I was hiding in the Christmas tree in Ironforge, bored out of my mind waiting for the spawn (using the technique described by Dinamitas) so I summoned my <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=15699/tranquil-mechanical-yeti">Tranquil Mechanical Yeti</a>. <br /><br /><b>Bam!</b> Suddenly nine other characters appeared out of thin air and ran over to the yeti. I don't know if they were thieves in sneak mode or were also hiding in the tree/presents but it was pretty funny...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Strokelock</b></h3><u><b>The No-Click-Method</b></u><br />You'll have to Key-Press, but not have to worry about clicking on that evasive Pet!<br /><br />1) Make a /target Globe yeti macro and drag the macro to any of the Multi Action Bars and bind to J (Or any other key ya want really).<br />2) Hit ESC go to Keybindings<br />3) Select Targeting &amp; Scroll down to &quot;Interact with Target&quot; and Bind it to a key. I used K<br />4) Drag the macro above to a Slot. I hit the down arrow on my Main Bar and used the '1' slot for that macro. But finally changed it to J on my top bar so I could use 2 fingers so I could drink coffee.<br /><br />Now you should have Target macro on 1 (or J) and your Interact With Target macro on K <br /><br />MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A <a href="/npc=63365/terrible-turnip">Terrible Turnip</a> or a Molten Corgi <a href="/npc=84915/molten-corgi">Molten Corgi</a> - something that takes it down to Health no less than 1 like <a href="/pet-ability=1357/superbark">Superbark</a> Superbark.<br /><br />Assuming you have done this, you can hit these as fast as possible like so: 1k1k1k1k1k1k1k1k1k or in my case jkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjk about every 30 mins. **Gotta be Fast! I can't stress this enough! If you are a drummer, well you know :p<br /><br />* To make the macro, type /macro Name it whatever you want, and use whatever icon you see fit. Inside the macro, type /tar Glob Yeti and hit save. Now you can move it anywhere you see fit by dragging the icon you chose to use onto your bars and bind it to a key.<br /><br />**Be fast enough and you have your pet while others /sigh at the 30 min wait! If you miss it, Look at the Time and be back in about 27-28 mins. <br /><br />G/L ALL!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Narinae</b></h3>To confirm that they don't spawn in Dalaran, I tested that globe by sitting for 35 minutes, mashing my macro. No sign of a yeti.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Freakaccident12</b></h3>An addition to another person's idea:<br /><br />Use Silverdragon and add mob ID 128156 - Screen will flash when it pops. You can watch Netflix on one monitor and have the second monitor waiting for the flash. I bound #1 to the macro for the /tar Globe Yeti and j to interact. Bam! Easy.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Whild</b></h3>The Yeti I caught was a Level 2 green quality, while my wife's was a Level 3 common quality. So I would suggest including at least one level 2 pet on your team.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SanguineCypress</b></h3><b>For best results, consider the following:</b><br /><br />1. Make this Macro. ===&gt; /target Globe Yeti<br /><br />2. Drag the Macro to a number on your action bar, I.E. &quot;8&quot; or &quot;5&quot;<br /><br />3. In your Key Bindings, set that number to MOUSE SCROLL UP.<br /><br />4. In Key Bindings, also set Interact With Target to MOUSE SCROLL DOWN.<br /><br />5.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>taylorde</b></h3>One thing i noticed i was monitering its spawn time when the yeti spawns it will run around in circles pretty quickly for about 1 minute which isn't too fast ya can catch it by standing in a spot. But 1 big thing ya gotta keep in mind IT IS ONLY UP FOR ABOUT 1 MINUTE THEN IT RUNS TO MIDDLE AND DESPAWNS and ya gotta wait 30-35 minutes again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>hobbesmarcus</b></h3>If you're like me (and God-willing, you are), you don't want to wait for a 30 minute spawn while competing with others. Waiting 30 minutes is bad enough but waiting 30 minutes to not get the pet is brutal.<br /><br />Since pets are account-bound, make a level one alt on a low pop server and fly/run it to Orgrimmar/Ironforge.<br /><br />I went to Realmpop.com and sorted it by the lowest horde and alliance populations, which were Tol Barad (H) and Mal'Ganis (A).<br /><br />Tol Barad had one person waiting and he got it before me. Mal'Ganis had nobody waiting and I got the pet after waiting a <b>very</b> short while.<br /><br />Be smart, don't compete with a bunch of others at the same time! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rutaria</b></h3>The best place to spawn camp this, in my experience, is Orgrimmar. This is because Ironforge's snowglobe is very close to the bank, AH and the holiday quest givers and is a high traffic area - so on top of competing with campers, you are also competing with people wandering past for auctions/banking/picking up quests. <br /><br />In Orgrimmar, the snowglobe is located at the top near the flightmaster. It does get traffic, but most of that is going away from the globe into the Valley of Strength so you're competing mostly with other pet collectors. It's also slightly closer if you're making a level 1 orc alt to run to Razor Hill-&gt;fly to Org and land right by the globe. Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gverderamo</b></h3>I logged in at 4 AM server time. There was a level 13 monk in there, but I beat her to it and got mine. Easy as pie and didn't bother with a macro.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aristillus</b></h3>If you find that youâ€™re being kicked from the Globe Yeti pet battle immediately after it starts, try disabling all addons. Three times in a row I entered battle with the Globe Yeti, only to be kicked out before I had the chance to take any action. It was almost like I had immediately forfeited, because each time I heard the sad-trombone forfeit/failure sound effect, but my pets suffered no loss in health. <br /><br />Before my fourth attempt I disabled all addons, after which I was able to do battle normally and capture the Yeti. <br /><br />I have not experienced this issue with any other pet battle before or since battling the Globe Yeti.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SFFCorgi</b></h3>Stalking a yeti at ick o'clock in the morning works really well, too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Belyea</b></h3>I know there are other posts, however, this is what I did to succeed with others around while on a high pop realm. Btw, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=85220">Terrible Turnip</a> pet worked perfectly as other pets that hit til 1 hitpoint!<br /><br />1. I made a macro /tar Globe Yeti and bound that macro to my action bar and bound that button to Wheel Down on my mouse. <br />(example, replace 12 on action bar to scroll wheel down in Interface&gt;key bindings&gt;Action Bar).<br /><br />2. I temporarily made my mouse wheel up, 'Interact With Target' in my Targeting Keybind window. <br />(example, Key Bindings&gt;Targeting (scroll down to interact with target) and click and scroll wheel down on mouse)<br /><br />3. I spammed mouse wheel up and down until I nearly lost my index finger when I suddenly was in a pet battle, haha. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=85220">Terrible Turnip</a> finished the job in 5 seconds. I hope this helps other who are on high pop realms facing competition. <br /><br />I stood under the Christmas Tree in Ironforge while wheeling up and down. I'm sure it would be the same in Orgrimmar. Good Luck pet friends!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Askania</b></h3><b> Hereâ€™s what I did, I had a horde on Illidan (itâ€™s not a cross realm server). NO MACRO NEEDED!<br /><br />I parked at the globe and went in at 10:26pm AEDT (SYDNEY) for the US itâ€™s super early hours of the morning, I was worried because there was still a lot of activity in Trade but no one at the globe or so I thought, there was one person fighting a yeti.<br /><br />I waited there until 10:56pm and got one YAY. The thing is the yeti doesnâ€™t appear with a battle pet paw above itâ€™s head, it just appears and starts running around and when you click on it you enter battle mode.<br /><br />It starts itâ€™s run behind the snowman so you need to be at the back of the globe and inside in order to be able to fight it. It has low health 127HP which makes it hard but I found out before I went to fight it that you put a terrible turnip in the first slot with Weakening Blow and that is all you do, because it wonâ€™t take the opponent below one HP and then you can cage it.<br /><br />The easiest thing to do would be to create an orc and use chauffeured hog to get to Org, their globe is on the platform where the flight master is towards the back.<br /><br />Hope this helps you get your pet.<br /><br />Ask<br /></b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Obika</b></h3>Caught it 3 times (yes I caught it 3 times even if people have trouble getting it, it was for science okay) and 3 out of those 3 yetis have a P/B breed and no variation in the fur color.<br />The sample size is small, but this hints towards believing there is only one breed and one skin for this pet. This means if you catch it once, you're good, no need to worry about not having your favorite color or the most optimized breed, because there is only one type.</div>
