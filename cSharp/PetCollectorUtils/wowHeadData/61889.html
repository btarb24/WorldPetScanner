This seems to give you pokemon versions of the Undercity Rat a little more quickly.\n\nThe critter and pokemon versions of the same spawn are probably linked, meaning that if you slay critter Undercity Rats, some come back as catchable Undercity Rats. Pokemon are also probably linked with each other, meaning that there will only be so many catchable ones in one area at one time, which are usually mixed between all of the kinds that spawn. So what makes this technique work is opening enough \"holes\" for the dead critter Undercity Rats to come back as pokemon Undercity Rats.\n\nThis could be utter nonsense speculation, but it seems to work pretty well for me.\n\nEdit: This works.

Getting one of these as an Alliance is going to be a trial and a half. It will likely be easiest to create a Horde character, if you can, and use your selection of pets to get your rat. <br /><br />There are rats which can be found in the outer 'Ruins Of Lordaeron', but these are ordinary <a href="/npc=61366/rat">Rat</a> mobs.<br /><br />Undercity rats share spawns with maggots and roaches down there, as well. In other words, if you are unable to find an Undercity Rat, clear out some of the other critters (either by killing them all, or battling the non-rat capturable mobs) and you will give the rats room to spawn in their place.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1039046</b></h3>yes for my server this is bugged so if you cant click and battle them open a ticket and hopefully you they fix this issue theres only 2 left also. server jubei'thos</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Farzeer</b></h3>Quite an annoying pet to get. Been flying around undercity for 2 hours now and i've been able to find 4 undercity rats (Lots of maggots and roaches tho). ALL 4 rats has been in places where i can't attack them (Area is obscured, or the area isn't flat enough)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>FuxieDK</b></h3>I could only find ONE of these bastards in UC, and it was running around behind one of the Auctioneers, giving me the message &quot;Pet battle area is obscured&quot;..<br /><br />After 5 minutes, I killed it with a Moonfire, in hope it would force a spawn of a new one somewhere else..<br />20 minutes later, still no Undercity Rat :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aliandrin</b></h3>One thing that's been working for me in these kinds of situations is this strategy.<br /><br />1. Slay the <i>critter</i> versions of the battle pet you want.<br /><br />2. Slay the <i>pokemon</i> versions of the battle pets that spawn in the area that you do not want.<br /><br />In this example, slay all critter versions of Undercity Rat and all pokemon versions of Roach and Maggot. This seems to give you pokemon versions of the Undercity Rat a little more quickly.<br /><br />The critter and pokemon versions of the same spawn are probably linked, meaning that if you slay critter Undercity Rats, some come back as catchable Undercity Rats. Pokemon are also probably linked with each other, meaning that there will only be so many catchable ones in one area at one time, which are usually mixed between all of the kinds that spawn. So what makes this technique work is opening enough &quot;holes&quot; for the dead critter Undercity Rats to come back as pokemon Undercity Rats.<br /><br />This could be utter nonsense speculation, but it seems to work pretty well for me.<br /><br />Edit: This works. Doing this diligently, I got about a rat per minute (rather than one per 10-15 minutes) until finally, however much time this is and 211 Rats later, I got my rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>803163</b></h3>Alliance: Unless you are itching for a challenge, and you really don't have any other horde toon on your account, you can follow these directions to get your Undercity Rat: <br /><br />1. Make an Undead toon on any server. <br /><br />2. Run your new Level 1 Undead to Brill (stay on the road, and head for the red FP on your map - you may be able to outrun dog attacks).<br /><br />3. Take the free FP to Undercity. <br /><br />4. Battle the Undercity Rats till you get what you want. Your Battle Pet skill (and all of your battle pets, of course) carries over to even a new level 1 toon.<br /><br />5. Log into your main pet-battling toon so your new Undercity Rat shows up in that toon's book.<br /><br />6. Delete the Undead toon, if desired.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>229919</b></h3>yes, battling or killing the other pets about does make the rats spawn, i have a white &amp; a black rare now</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kcartwright856</b></h3>If you're like me, you may have had the misfortune of heading to Undercity and finding nothing but maggots and roaches. Even worse, you may have found the elusive Undercity Rat that would not maneuver into a position in which to battle. Infuriating.<br /><br />For roughly 30 minutes, I flew around the Undercity in search of rats to capture and call my own. As my patience dwindled, I finally began to slay all of the maggots and roaches in a blind rage. My anger nearly consumed me until I noticed that an Undercity Rat had appeared where my maggot massacre took place. I quickly swept in to capture it and, golly gee, it was a rare. Oh, happy day!<br /><br />To make a long story short, just kill innocent creatures until the ones that you want appear.<br /><br />Note: Plain &quot;critters&quot; did not seem to affect the battle pet spawns for me, though your mileage may vary. Restrict your rage to the battle pet creatures. Unless you really just can't control yourself.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1052876</b></h3>I found one in the old pvp room in UC, but i couldnt battle down there, i tried everything but it didnt worked</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pegosis</b></h3>I went to Undercity to search for one of these, i looked everywhere and couldn't find 1. i started battling the roaches and maggots that were roaming around, shortly after about 3 rats had spawned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wowcataryn</b></h3>As was posted by Aliandrin, the best way to spawn the rats is to kill all rat critters and the roach and maggot battle-pets. It still takes an ungodly long time to get a rare, but persevere and you will eventually be rewarded. You'll want to go to the throne room periodically and clear out ALL the battle-pets there, including the rats since pet battles do not work in that room at all.<br /><br />As a nice aside, I captured my rare Undercity Rat using a rare Stormwind Rat (which was a LOT easier to get!)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Eccentrica</b></h3>After farming for and finally bagging a rare rat, you will have an intimate knowledge of the layout of Undercity. Unfortunately this knowledge will be utterly useless to you in future, as you will undertake a solemn vow never to return.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maritas</b></h3>Like everyone else, kill everything that moves and repeat several times over. Make sure to kill the ones in the royal chambers because you can't catch them anyway and they just take up a spawn point.<br /><br />There is a rat that spawns by one of the auctioneers - don't kill it. With a little patience it can be battled and it just might turn out to be a rare. It spawned 3x and I got the rare on the 4th try - even though the idiot killed it earlier.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1062573</b></h3>When farming a rare version of this pet, fly circles around the middle and outer ring of the area (the middle ring is much faster and sees most of the city, but it will miss rats along the outer-most edges). You need to kill any Roaches you find as they share spawns. There is no spawn timer to the Undercity Rat, it's just a matter of killing all non-rat spawns to force rat spawns (it seems to be about a 50% spawn rate).<br /><br />One other catch. People tend to grab the ones in the middle of the city over time, making them seem really uncommon, but in reality it's usually that a bunch are spawned in Sylvannas's room to the southwest (finding like 5-6 in there is possible; they tend to pool in there since people never go to her room). Go in there and kill any Roaches/Rats you find there (you could try battling them, but all areas of the room appear to be &quot;obstructed&quot; for pet combat, meaning you probably just need to kill them), and you should find a bunch of spawns throughout the city again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1170496</b></h3>Not required for the safari achievement for alliance, so unless you want one for collection reasons, it's not mandatory.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lionsofmercy</b></h3>I found that coming back early in the morning (i.e. 6:15) helped a lot, especially as I'd never been in Undercity before and it took me a while to catch on to the elevators, durr. Less competition=rare rat in ten minutes. (You will know if there's competition if you start coming across dead critters that you didn't kill.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cajun06</b></h3>Idk what I am doing wrong, but I can only find a Undercity Rat inside the building itself, yet since I'm Alliance, I get attacked like crazy trying to find it. Anyone have any suggestions?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Marzen</b></h3>This may not get up-voted to matter, but my experience was that the green paw that shows up on the map normally <b><i>didn't</i></b> while I was farming for this pet in Undercity. I had to mouse over what looked like normal critters to see the cursor change to the green paw to initiate battle. On my mini-map it didn't show as a battle pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Johnsphil</b></h3>I had wondered if the post condition of Undercity after the release of battle for lordaeron would permit me to go there and collect one freely. Don't attempt it, the blight will kill you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>woodchips</b></h3>I don't understand why I've not seen this comment. I had all the pets, except for the Undercity rat. So I sent a horde toon to the ruins above Undercity. So many rats there, pets as well as critters. One of them must be for me. I killed a zillion of the rats, every one I could find, hoping one would re-spawn as Undercity rat pets. Then I noticed on the mini-map, I saw Undercity rats, in grey. So they were there, but just underground, in the city itself. I went down into the tunnels, and almost immediately found an Undercity rat to capture.<br /><br />The pet I found was only uncommon, so I looked for a second, and then found almost immediately a second. This one was a rare.<br /><br />So I wonder if many of the people who have been killing rats with wild abandon, may possibly have been looking only in the surface ruins? Since I play mainly alliance toons, I tended not to think of the undercity itself. And that led me to send my toon just to the surface at first. Luckily, I had a level 29 horde toon to send down into the city itself.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cougey</b></h3>Does anyone know if you can get this pet after 9.2.5 with Undercity now gone?<br /><br />edit: nevermind.... Zidormi is still there just doesn't show the map icon if you've completed the 9.2.5 questline.</div>
