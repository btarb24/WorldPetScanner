Mostly around the 2 large lakes but also around the Golden Pagoda. And YES some level 1 battle pets DO spawn also[i] inside[\/i] the Shrine of the 2 Moons.\n\nFor the level 1 Gilded Moths, just use the [u]\"\/tar Gilded Moth\"[\/u] macro and your [u]Interact with Target[\/u] button, since they can be in the walls and the floor of the 2nd level sometimes. But this takes too long and is very unreliable, plus your Moth is only level 1.\n\n[b][u]Now for getting a level 24 Rare[\/u][\/b], you may or may not have done the quest chains on the but either way your best bet is the lake and surrounding area around the Mogu'Shan Palace. This is becuase even without doing any of the quests in the map, you will still see these Moths that spawn around this eastern half of the map.\n\nBut what you want to do is [u][i]make[\/i][\/u] the groups of 3 moths that spawn around this area, to be Battle pets. What i though was that if i killed the moths that were Critters, they would spawn as a Battle pet... but what i noticed was that the Critters i didn't kill, (other animals than the moths), they would TURN into a Battle Pet. So what i did was amend the plan, and i started killing all the other animals, Critters and Battle Pets, thus [i]forcing[\/i] the map to make the existing mobs of 3 Moths (the only things i would leave alive) into a Battle Pet Mob. I did this until i had a good few mobs of the 3 Moths and Battle Pets now.\n\nOnce i had this, i would do the usual farm technique for any mob of 3 Battle Pets. That is, to Raid marker [u]one[\/u] of them, and then fight the other 2, and then having those 2 re-spawn in 5-7 minutes as Battle Pet Gilded Moths with [i]new[\/i] stats\/quality. \nThen during the 5-7 minutes re-spawn time i would fly around the Mogu'Shan Palace and surrounding area again, killing all the other non-moth Battle Pets and Critters and making myself more mobs of Battle Pet Moths. I did this till i had 4 of the Battle Pet Gilded Moth mobs to farm. This doesn't take too long, but it really does work effectively. Now you may still take some time for the game to be kind enough to you to spawn a pair of Rares (for me it was a bout an hour and a half) but that all depends how lucky you are, and this way gives you much better odds.\n\nBest thing is this way, once you DO find yourself a rare Gilded Moth, you can then call over a friend, or anyone near by that can battle level 24 mobs, to come tame the other one becuase it will be the same identical quality\/stats.","date":"2012-11-06T08:24:36-06:00","rating":47,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Firstly, you are a genius.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>adashiel</b></h3>They often spawn in linked groups of three (i.e., identical quality ratings and secondary pets), and do not appear as secondaries for other pets. I was having a tough time finding spawns, so I started battling just two members of a linked group, and then waiting for them to respawn*. So long as at least one of the moths from the group remained, replacements would spawn after five minutes or so. When the new ones did appear, they would have new (also linked) stats. I eventually got my rare that way. The only problem is other pet hunters would sometimes come by and kill the remaining pet before the new ones appeared. That breaks the spawning cycle and I would have to hunt around for another group of three.<br /><br />*It probably would also work to battle just one and leave two behind, but I wanted XP from the extra battle for my leveling pet.(##RESPBREAK##)2056##DELIM##adashiel##DELIM##</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>452572</b></h3>OK fellow pet collectors... here's the skinny on getting yourself a <u>rare</u> Gilded Moth.<br /><br />First off, if you don't already know, yes these things appear mostly all over the Vale of Eternal Blossoms map. Mostly around the 2 large lakes but also around the Golden Pagoda. And YES some level 1 battle pets DO spawn also<i> inside</i> the Shrine of the 2 Moons.<br /><br />For the level 1 Gilded Moths, just use the <u>&quot;/tar Gilded Moth&quot;</u> macro and your <u>Interact with Target</u> button, since they can be in the walls and the floor of the 2nd level sometimes. But this takes too long and is very unreliable, plus your Moth is only level 1.<br /><br /><b><u>Now for getting a level 24 Rare</u></b>, you may or may not have done the quest chains on the but either way your best bet is the lake and surrounding area around the Mogu'Shan Palace. This is becuase even without doing any of the quests in the map, you will still see these Moths that spawn around this eastern half of the map.<br /><br />But what you want to do is <u><i>make</i></u> the groups of 3 moths that spawn around this area, to be Battle pets. What i though was that if i killed the moths that were Critters, they would spawn as a Battle pet... but what i noticed was that the Critters i didn't kill, (other animals than the moths), they would TURN into a Battle Pet. So what i did was amend the plan, and i started killing all the other animals, Critters and Battle Pets, thus <i>forcing</i> the map to make the existing mobs of 3 Moths (the only things i would leave alive) into a Battle Pet Mob. I did this until i had a good few mobs of the 3 Moths and Battle Pets now.<br /><br />Once i had this, i would do the usual farm technique for any mob of 3 Battle Pets. That is, to Raid marker <u>one</u> of them, and then fight the other 2, and then having those 2 re-spawn in 5-7 minutes as Battle Pet Gilded Moths with <i>new</i> stats/quality. <br />Then during the 5-7 minutes re-spawn time i would fly around the Mogu'Shan Palace and surrounding area again, killing all the other non-moth Battle Pets and Critters and making myself more mobs of Battle Pet Moths. I did this till i had 4 of the Battle Pet Gilded Moth mobs to farm. This doesn't take too long, but it really does work effectively. Now you may still take some time for the game to be kind enough to you to spawn a pair of Rares (for me it was a bout an hour and a half) but that all depends how lucky you are, and this way gives you much better odds.<br /><br />Best thing is this way, once you DO find yourself a rare Gilded Moth, you can then call over a friend, or anyone near by that can battle level 24 mobs, to come tame the other one becuase it will be the same identical quality/stats.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Terminton</b></h3>Confirmed locations for Gilded Moth in Vale of Eternal Blossoms: <br />66:28, 59:28, 68:28 (near Shrine of Two Moons)<br />55:33.5 (to south from Golden Pagoda) - fly up a bit, stay at edge and battle<br />60.5:34.5, 63,44.5 (to east from Golden Pagoda)<br />68:38, 75.5:25 (near lake)<br /><br />Gilded Moth share spawn <b>only</b> with non-capturable version of it so best to check eastern part of vale, around lakes with targeting macro and kill all non-capturable Gilded Moths to create more farming points.<br /><br />There also can be 2 moths at 75,15 (high in mountains) - haven't managed to battle it yet :)<br /><br />Strategy to fight 2 of 3 works fine, less then 5 min for new moths to fill up group.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>nmb3000</b></h3>After reading the comments about where these pets are post patch 5.4, I never had any luck at all finding them anywhere in the Vale, especially not near the two shrines or Mogushan Palace. There is a group of 3 normal critters that spawn near where the Golden Pagoda was, but even after killing them a dozen+ times, they never respawned as battle pets.<br /><br />I'd pretty much given up when I randomly came across a group of three at about <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/maps?data=5840:305640">(30.5, 64) in the Vale</a>. My group was two grays and a green B/B -- given the apparent rarity of this pet and the large number of breeds, maximizing this pet could be quite tough :(<br /><br /><b>Edit:</b> I was near this spot again today and noticed that the group of three moths had spawned as non-combat critters instead of battle pets. If you're hunting this pet and you come across this group as critters, try killing them and they may respawn as battle pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>reidsb</b></h3>There are several groups of these that spawn a bit NW of Mogushan Palace, at roughly 73:15.<br /><br />Of course, they're smack dab in the middle of a mountain with no flat land near them to battle on, so... they aren't much use. Try to perch somewhere close and kill them in the hopes that they will then spawn somewhere else.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vindictae</b></h3>I've just picked up a blue level 1 of these on Summer Terrace (Alliance) where they flutter around up top. there were 4 of them flying there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Twodotsonekb</b></h3>For the people trying to find these post-5.4 (and now WoD), they are relatively uncommon spawns in groups of three near the shrines. I found mine just east of the Golden Pagoda.If you see level 1 groups not tagged for battling, kill them and fly around looking for respawns. That's how a lot of uncommon battle pet spawns work anyway.<br /><br />Found an S/S myself (common quality), but I'm more than happy. Do NOT waste your time trying to interact with the ones stuck in the mountains bordering Kun-Lai Summit, it's not going to happen.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Crystore</b></h3>They can be found at the balcony of Shrine of Seven Stars and in front of the shrine(front of sentinels).
