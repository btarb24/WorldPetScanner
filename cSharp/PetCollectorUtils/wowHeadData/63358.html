<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1037639</b></h3>I'd like to confirm that, as mentioned, the Sifang Otter Pup can be found in <b>Krasarang Wilds</b>.<br /><br />I found them after engaging Malayan Quillrats and Jungle Grubs near Jhu's Watch. The Sifang Otter Pup showed up as a secondary.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1041700</b></h3>Caught mine at 86, 9 in<b> Krasarang Wilds</b>. Two spawned with a Mummy Otter.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Niaw</b></h3>If you insist on capturing a primary rather than secondary, I have found them at Jade Forest 38.8, 87.4. This is the same location that is shown for the critter (non-battle pet) version: <a href="/npc=64788/sifang-otter-pup">Sifang Otter Pup</a>. It's on one of the small islands in the estuary between Jade Forest and Krasarang Wilds. The one with the umbrella. I also just found them pretty immediately due west of that island, on the shore. The coordinates are Krasarang Wilds 86,10. And also a little further south than that.<br /><br /><s>At the time of posting Wowhead still hasn't updated to show these occurrences on its maps yet.</s><br />Looks like the map is finally updated :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ravij</b></h3>For those who do not have any sort of Coordinate Addon; The Sifang Otter Pups can be found along the Eastern Coast of Krasarang Wilds across from the Jade Forest zone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Grukam</b></h3>As stated above Krasarang Wilds 85.84, 16.50 right across from Jade Forest. RNG was good to me caught a rare first time. Lvl 22 health hp 1301 power 240 speed 255 after capture.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DarlingDoolittle</b></h3>This may be a very silly question, but is there a way to trade these? I want one so bad, but leveling battle pets is becoming very tedious.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1060528</b></h3>Found one in Jade Forrest; 40,98. One of the islands between Jade Forrest and Krasarang Wilds.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>933768</b></h3>I hope this gets fixed soon. When I go to the above mentioned place between Krasarang Wilds and Jade Forest, I get phased, slow enough to see the battle-able pets ashore, but too fast to battle them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>770017</b></h3>I found mine in Pawdon Glade on an island between Jade Forest and Krasarang Wilds. about the same co-ordinates as above 86.41 10.22. There was an otter and two pups.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>800765</b></h3>While it can be found on the east coast of Krasarang Wilds(85, 16) it should be noted tha if you've completed some the opening of the Shieldwall event then te pets will phase out.<br />.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>construkt</b></h3>If you are getting phase out issues, the best way to get this pet is mentioned above. Go to Zhu's Watch and battle everything around there. If there isn't a pup as a secondary, retreat and try another one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>960349</b></h3>I can cofirm that this pet seems to be not in the Valley of the 4 Winds but spawns in Krasarang Wilds. I just found my rare one near ZhuÂ´s Watch (west side) and appeard as 3rd pet when I attacked a Luyu Moth :) I also saw some as 2nd and 3rd pet while attacking some Jungle Grubs :) Happy Hunting</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Neetka</b></h3>You will run into phasing issues along Krasarang Cove and the area south of Zhu's Watch if you have participated in the 'landing' of expansion 5.1. Once the forts are built you can't see spawns on the southern edge of the cove or the coastal area south of Zhu's Watch where the horde scouts are running around.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>42855</b></h3>In Krasarang wilds. On beach bordering to Jade forest. <br /><br />Easiest way to deal with the zoning issues in 5.1 is to log an alt. <br />I tried the mentioned other strategies below to no avail.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sarceth</b></h3>To see on the map, check the map location of <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=64788">the critter version.</a>.<br /><br />It's actually in the Jade Forest, not in Krasarang Wilds, like many people suggest.<br />Though it's on the border, really.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>shluttythepriest</b></h3>I don't know if anyone else ran into this issue but when i flew out there to get this pet he disappeared. I had no idea why, I wasn't on a flight path or anything, but for some reason he just kept disappearing every time i went down to get him. Well my main has completed the dominance dailies, so i logged on to another toon and he was there. :) So i would suggest taking a toon out there that has NOT done any of the dominance quests. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dgnuff</b></h3>If you've done the &quot;Lion's Landing&quot; quests and are running into phasing problems, they can still be found at 73.2 22.4 in Krasarang wilds. You're close to the edge of the phased area, but if you wander round there you'll find quite a few green paws, with otter cubs fairly common as secondaries.<br /><br />For those without coordinates, find the point that's exactly half way between Zhu's Watch and The Incursion, then go a little southeast from there and you should find them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1109396</b></h3>I found my rare in the islands at Garrosh'ar Point, border between Krasarang Wilds and Jade Forest. It was one in a pack of four, one momma Sifang Otter followed by three pups. I recommend fighting the pups, they all come in different rarities, but don't fight the mother. If you don't find your rare, she'll spawn new pups in about 15 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>holdwine</b></h3>Phasing issues made it complicated to capture one of these on the coast of Krasarang near the Alliance incursion.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>killertofu</b></h3>Found an uncommon one at Krasarang Cove which is southeast of Zhu's Watch on the beach. Saw about 6-7 at a time. Happy Hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>StarFire2686</b></h3>I was in Jade Forest collecting companions and came across a small area where this companion and the parent were supposed to spawn. However upon reaching the area there were none. I happen to see some but they were not ones I could fight and capture. Well I was annoyed so I killed them and as soon as this was done a family of ones that were able to be captured suddenly appeared. One adult and two pups just like I had seen before. I don't know if this was purely coincidence or not but I figured I would mention this because maybe it will help someone in the future.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Deathzbreath</b></h3>Ok the best I can tell there are 3 spawns of these little devils in The Jade Forest. One at 86,9 one at 39,87 and one at 38,93. It appears they can all be 'normal' critters as they seem to share a respawn with the battle pets. I flew around killing the normal ones until the little buggers popped up and got me one! Don't give up, takes some patience but you can do it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ooblushy88oo</b></h3>Like the others have said the spot between Jade and Krasarang, near 85, 16 is the best spot to get your pup.<br /><br />I too..tried Valley of Four Winds but had zero luck.<br /><br />Went to that spot listed above and got my pup :)<br /><br />Happy hunting and capturing!</div>
