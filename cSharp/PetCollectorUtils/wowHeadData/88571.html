<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>incith</b></h3>Didn't find any for a couple of hours..so I camped out around 47,88 and killed all the critters, all of them, anything I could find. Battle critters and regular critters. After about 10 minutes 2 mudback calfs spawned for my taking.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kharlkuhlinayn</b></h3>The key really is two-fold. Clearing the non-battle versions AND clearing other battle pets in the general vicinity so that when they respawn, there is a chance they respawn in the pools as the calf.<br /><br />I spent close to 3 or 4 hours total flying from pond to pond and killing all the non-battle versions and they always just re-spawned as the same thing. Once I started killing them and then flying around and blasting the other battle pets since I already had them as rares anyways) the calves started re-spawning as battle pet versions and I had all 3 breeds including a rare version of the preferred H/P breed.<br /><br />The biggest issue is you have to do most of it yourself because there is rarely anyone in the zone anymore. When I was there, /who showed me noone else in the zone. I would have been happy to help kill battle pets to help the calf spawns if someone else was hunting for them since I had mine. :)</div>
