When wild pets are caught or killed in the zone, it frees up a spot for a new spawn to appear somewhere on the map. Because there are more 'normal' pet nodes in a zone, it is more likely that a 'normal' battle pet will spawn, with a smaller chance to spawn at the 'rarer' spawns. But it seems with enough catches\/kills, the rarer battle pets will eventually appear.\n\nSo if you're waiting around for hours, it could be because no catches or kills are happening in your zone--especially if it's a low population area.\n\nMy experience has been that only catching\/killing battle pet critters affects respawning--killing non-battle critters seems to have no effect. This can save running\/mount time only focusing on clearing battle pets.\n\nServer restarts\/resets are also a popular time to hunt as there is an even distribution of battle pets across all node types. But they can quickly become cleared out, resulting in the above situation.\n\nThe Jade Oozes spawn inside the cave, around the mouth of the cave, and also on top of the mound on occasion (I think there is only one spawn point there).\n\nThis trick has worked for other rares also, like the Scorpling and the Tiny Twister--both of which only have a handful spawn points in a zone.

After flying around for several hours looking for rare versions of some of the other zone pets and periodically checking for the oozling, it had never spawned, either inside or outside of the cave. I don't think other zone BP spawns affect it, because I probably cleared out more than 100 other BPs.\n\n2.) After spending roughly 1.5 - 2 hours clearing out everything in the cave, including the bugged ooze, normal oozes, and maggot critters, I'd seen roughly 10-12 Jade Oozlings Spawn, generally 1 or 2 at a time.\n\n3.) Oozlings were often up alongside other mobs in the cave, although they did spawn consistently as I kept clearing the cave. I don't think the cave needs to be completely clear to keep triggering them, because it's very difficult to actually keep the cave clean with dynamic respawns.\n\nMy best guess is that the Oozlings are probably on some kind of very long timer on their own - too many people have seen 10+ up at a time for them to be entirely based on cave clearing. However, it does also seem reasonable after the several hours I spent looking for them that clearing either the maggots or the cave as a whole DOES *encourage* them to spawn, although it doesn't seem to guarentee it. There were several periods of 20 minutes or so where no Oozlings spawned, but I would then get 1-2 within a few minutes. Be patient if you're attempting to farm them this way, and you should eventually see them show up.\n\nAdditionally, they CAN spawn just outside of the cave entrance. I fought at least 3 either in the doorway or on the grass immediately outside, so as you're running laps to clear the cave, stick your head outside to check and see if there are any up - you can't see the BP markers while you're inside the cave.\n\nHappy hunting, and I hope this helps!","date":"2013-01-11T18:04:31-06:00","rating":13,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2013-01-11T18:05:04-06:00",1,"Empy3"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":33,"id":1797892,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Allystria","body":"Couldn't sleep so around 2am MST went rare pet hunting.

You should in theory have a tiny shot at one of the mobs dropping an [item=20768] which could in theory contain a Disgusting Oozeling.","date":"2013-06-10T20:06:18-05:00","rating":4,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":49,"id":1868407,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"lloviosa","body":"Cave opening is at 57.4,  38.6","date":"2013-06-20T04:21:24-05:00","rating":15,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":50,"id":1872143,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"745389","body":"co-ords were totally correct 58.52. they were all in a cave. fought 3 of them and on the fourth got me rare nice :)","date":"2013-06-30T03:28:04-05:00","rating":-1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":51,"id":1874780,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"rawford","body":"just got to the cave and there wasnt any there so i went through the cave killing everything in sight, no pets spawned so i went through the cave again killing everything and i killed everything outside the cave and still nothing, this is my 4th time going through the cave killing everything and still nothing. ill update when one finally spawns","date":"2013-07-08T07:38:51-05:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":52,"id":1905254,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"1148492","body":"Horde- Bleeding Hollow\r\n\r\nJust arrived at the cave around 7:44pm server time (EST) and the cave was full of oozelings.

I found 3 of them outside the cave mouth (I've submitted a screenshot to prove it), including the rare I ended up taming.<br /><br />I spent all of yesterday killing everything (including the critters / maggots) in the cave and outside the cave, and saw no sign of a Jade Oozeling. This morning, I logged in at about 8:20am PST (right into the cave, where I logged out), and there were a ton of them inside the cave.<br /><br />Battling them allowed others to spawn for about 10 minutes, then no more replaced them after about 8:30am PST. When I left the cave, there were 3 outside.<br /><br />PS, seems it takes about 72 hours for the screenshot, but it has been added!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1044793</b></h3>I can confirm that killing every single thing in the cave works extremely well. However, if you have luck like mine, one spawned literally inside the cave walls. I could target it and everything, searched the whole cave. It was stuck inside one of the walls and I COULD /target it, but it did me no good. This also happened to the Widow Spiderling found in Darkshire. It was inside one of the trees and I could target it, but couldn't fight.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Janettie</b></h3>My advice is to make a /target maggot macro and kill all the maggots you can see. The regular oozes do not seem to matter, but the maggots share respawns with the much more valuable jade oozelings.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mychelle</b></h3>Submitting my own findings as far as trying to get this annoying little critter goes.<br /><br />1.) Killing all the actual &quot;Mobs&quot; (Jade Oozes, Green Sludges) had nothing to do with them spawning. I did this three times. Absolutely nothing.<br /><br />2.) Making sure to kill all of the actual Level 1 Maggot Critters <b>DID</b> have an effect on the spawning. After taking the time to circle twice the cave and outside the cave to kill the critter maggots, I had two jade oozelings spawn for me. #1 inside the cave, #2 just outside the cave near the mouth of the cave. <i>(#1 Poor, #2 died in a tragic swiping accident....)</i><br /><br />Go to the cave. Go on a maggot killing frenzy. Profit with a Jade Oozeling spawning for you.<br /><br />Edit - Jesus jumping over a pit full of Oozelings on a jumping jack.<br /><br />Ive now come back to the post about...2 hours later. I'd left the cave and played around on another character for awhile. Zoned back in on my &quot;pet quester&quot; toon to find a total of 9 fricken Jade Oozelings spawned. Sadly none of them were rare. But I'll be happy with the Uncommon I caught now instead of the Poor I originally got two hours ago.<br /><br />None of these spawns were outside the cave.<br /><br />I am still convinced that a major factor in luck with these things are in tune with how they spawn in. Kill the maggots, and hope for the best.<br /><br />Oh. And the whole &quot;1 spawns every 15 minutes&quot; is absolute BS.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>twistedtwilight</b></h3>For those of you following these strategies and having no luck, I encountered this too.<br /><br /> After repeatedly clearing the cave, I thought the other comments were just people who got lucky. There is a trigger for the Oozelings!<br /><br /> On occasion a mob will spawn under the ramps and go on evade, if you've killed everything see if you can find one by /targeting it, set an icon on it to confirm it's just not in the next room.<br /><br /> Kill it with AoE when you're standing on top of it, where it will attempt to melee you. I had an ooze spawn immediatly after it died. <br /><br /> Unfortunately the Oozeling spawned under the rocks in the water room, I was able to /target it and get close enough to use my &quot;interact&quot; keybind to trigger the fight should this happen in addition to the &quot;spawn triggering&quot; mob.<br /><br /> After collecting the Oozeling more spawned on my way out, they spawned correctly.<br /><br /> I hope that helps you and saves you the fustration I encountered farming this cave, it took me two hours and an accidental aggro trigger from the bugged npc to realize the fix.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LeiaSolo</b></h3>If you decide to aoe the maggots and mobs to make them spawn quicker, keep in mind that if there is a jade oozeling nearby you CAN kill it too with your aoe :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1054494</b></h3>I arrived at the cave with tons of paws on the map. I went through and battled every ooze until I got an uncommon, then dismissed battles until the cave was clear. I did not kill any of the actual mobs. No sooner had I finished the last battle, did a fresh batch of engage-able oozes spawn. <br /><br />After battling them, I got nothing but maggots. It's really as simple as oozes or maggots in this case and none of the larger mobs seem at all related to the spawn of what is essentially critter spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>decembre</b></h3>These, along with many of the other rarer battle pet spawns, seem to work much like fishing nodes--where only a set amount of battle pets can be on the map at one time. When wild pets are caught or killed in the zone, it frees up a spot for a new spawn to appear somewhere on the map. Because there are more 'normal' pet nodes in a zone, it is more likely that a 'normal' battle pet will spawn, with a smaller chance to spawn at the 'rarer' spawns. But it seems with enough catches/kills, the rarer battle pets will eventually appear.<br /><br />So if you're waiting around for hours, it could be because no catches or kills are happening in your zone--especially if it's a low population area.<br /><br />My experience has been that only catching/killing battle pet critters affects respawning--killing non-battle critters seems to have no effect. This can save running/mount time only focusing on clearing battle pets.<br /><br />Server restarts/resets are also a popular time to hunt as there is an even distribution of battle pets across all node types. But they can quickly become cleared out, resulting in the above situation.<br /><br />The Jade Oozes spawn inside the cave, around the mouth of the cave, and also on top of the mound on occasion (I think there is only one spawn point there).<br /><br />This trick has worked for other rares also, like the Scorpling and the Tiny Twister--both of which only have a handful spawn points in a zone. I generally hunt for pets around 2-4am, so I have little to no competition and don't have to worry about campers sweeping in as I clear pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>decembre</b></h3>You can start a battle with a pet that is stuck in a wall or tree with the 'Interact with Target' keybind. This can be found in the Targeting section.<br /><br />Set a key for the command, target the pet using /tar 'name of pet', then hit your keybind.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AmadiaHS</b></h3>After spending over an hour killing every single thing in sight, including all oozes and maggots, and only getting ONE single jade oozeling spawn...I have little faith in the notion that killing anything affects their spawn. I saw only 2 other level-appropriate people in the area doing quests, and considering that I was watching my mini-map like a hawk, I'm not keen on the idea that someone might have been taking my oozes. I sympathize with others who haven't had such great luck. Only one spawn in an hour's time is surely nothing to build a theory on.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1030919</b></h3>Okay, I have read this whole page twice, and put the various techniques to the test. After 3 hours, This is the lowdown:<br /><br />1) Jade Oozeling will ONLY spawn in the cave.<br />2) Jade Oozeling will only spawn in an EMPTY cave. Kill everything. The maggot critters, too.<br /><br />Once the cave is empty, it will spawn immediately somewhere inside the cave. If you are fast, once captured, it is possible for another to spawn, since the cave will still be empty. If not, you may have to go and clear it again.<br /><br />Experience:<br />The best method I found was to start at the geographically highest point, and kill everything down to the lowest point. Once in the lowest room, there is an Ooze that spawns under the ramp, but is vulnerable to attack by AoE. <br /><br />Jade Oozeling spawn results after 3 hours destroying the cave:<br />8x Poor quality<br />3x Common quality<br />1x Uncommon quality<br /><br />As a side note, I came back after logging and found several (3-4?)opposite faction camping the spot, some in, some out side the cave. The cave was *completely* empty, and no Jade Oozeling. Thinking my theory was debunked, I checked the Ooze under the ramp, killed him, and instantly the Oozeling appeared. Poor Quality, but nonetheless, mystery solved (as far as I am concerned). <br /><br />Good luck and happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dsiacono</b></h3>I must be extremely lucky because my very first Jade Oozeling is rare. I didn't even slay all the Jade Oozes or Green Sludges. My location when I saw the rare pet was at 59.7, 41.6 if that helps any. I did start slaying as many maggots as I could too. Happy hunting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mollygo</b></h3>I agree with one of the previous posters about the early morning thing. I have spent the last 2 weeks trying to get this! With the cross realm thing, it doesnt matter if your low pop or not, so no point trying to get it that way. I tried clearing everything, i tried only killing ooze, or only maggots, all between 5pm and 8pm. I wake up this morning at 7am and there was one, i killed 1 jade ooze due to it agro'd me, but all the others were alive in the cavern. Got my oozeling, and left, when i went outside there were 3-4 other oozling paws on my map that didnt show while i was in the cave.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1064275</b></h3>This is definitely an AM pet. I have cleared this cave about 5 or 6 times and never saw a pet spawn (always in the evening). I checked today about 8:30am and it was there with a cave full of oozes and slimes. Lucky for me it was a rare! It must be an early Christmas for me, because last night I tamed Minfernal after about 5 minutes of camping. Good luck everyone.<br /><br />edit: I just flew over the cave about 9:45am and there was another pet spawned, whilst the cave was full of mobs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1067993</b></h3>So after swifting through all of these comments and spending half my day running through the caves whilst waiting a long long low lvl queue I can confirm/invalidate the following findings.<br /><br />1. NOT an AM pet! I had a batch of 5 oozelings between 2:39 pm and 2:47 pm, see screenshot.<br /><br />2. Killing all mobs francticly did NOT help me make it appear.<br /><br />3. Killing all maggots critters did NOT help me make it appear, moonfire spam also didn't accidentally kill oozelings.<br /><br />4. Killing all maggots battle pets did NOT help me make it appear.<br /><br />5. Getting rid of battle pets in the area did NOT help me make it appear.<br /><br />What was noteworthy though:<br />There were no maggots battle pets up, there were also no other battle pets in the vicinity when they finally appeared.<br />Once one popped, suddenly there were 2 more, and 2 more spawned right after that.<br /><br />So I can't tell you what makes these buggers appear, my 2 cents is still, clearing other battle pets in the area. In particular all the marmots and maggots around the cave.<br />Once again, not an AM pet, mine appeared well in the afternoon!<br /><br />Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mathaylla</b></h3>I read through the comments and figured that I'd start with an easier option: clearing out the cave. Killed everything twice over, none spawned. So then I decided to follow the logic that they share spawn timers with other battle pet spawns in the zone. I flew around for 30 minutes or so battling every pet I found (wasn't a total waste of time...captured a rare quality <a href="/npc=61752/brown-marmot">Brown Marmot</a> in the process). Flew back to Skulk Rock and found that one Jade Oozeling has spawned inside the cave, so I was able to capture it (common quality, level 12). This was at 4:40am server time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Empy3</b></h3>After spending several hours hunting a rare Jade Oozling this morning, I feel pretty confident making some observations about its spawn.<br /><br />1.) After flying around for several hours looking for rare versions of some of the other zone pets and periodically checking for the oozling, it had never spawned, either inside or outside of the cave. I don't think other zone BP spawns affect it, because I probably cleared out more than 100 other BPs.<br /><br />2.) After spending roughly 1.5 - 2 hours clearing out everything in the cave, including the bugged ooze, normal oozes, and maggot critters, I'd seen roughly 10-12 Jade Oozlings Spawn, generally 1 or 2 at a time.<br /><br />3.) Oozlings were often up alongside other mobs in the cave, although they did spawn consistently as I kept clearing the cave. I don't think the cave needs to be completely clear to keep triggering them, because it's very difficult to actually keep the cave clean with dynamic respawns.<br /><br />My best guess is that the Oozlings are probably on some kind of very long timer on their own - too many people have seen 10+ up at a time for them to be entirely based on cave clearing. However, it does also seem reasonable after the several hours I spent looking for them that clearing either the maggots or the cave as a whole DOES *encourage* them to spawn, although it doesn't seem to guarentee it. There were several periods of 20 minutes or so where no Oozlings spawned, but I would then get 1-2 within a few minutes. Be patient if you're attempting to farm them this way, and you should eventually see them show up.<br /><br />Additionally, they CAN spawn just outside of the cave entrance. I fought at least 3 either in the doorway or on the grass immediately outside, so as you're running laps to clear the cave, stick your head outside to check and see if there are any up - you can't see the BP markers while you're inside the cave.<br /><br />Happy hunting, and I hope this helps!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Allystria</b></h3>Couldn't sleep so around 2am MST went rare pet hunting. Started with one right outside the front of the cave. Took about 5 till I got my rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>341848</b></h3>While you're looking for the oozeling, please keep an eye out for level appropriate characters who are actually questing through the zone. There are quests to kill Jade Oozes and the Direglob, and it is very disheartening to be carefully pulling and killing the oozes, only to see a level 90 run past you, killing everything. I understand that clearing the cave may force the pets to spawn, but if there is someone level appropriate there, please be considerate to the fact that they need those mobs too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Axebeard</b></h3>I found that this thing was a complete beast when I was trying to capture it, and it easily wiped the floor with the at-level pets I was trying to use to take it out. If you encounter a similar problem, keep in mind it is a Magic pet, so there is no reason you cannot bring in a high-level pet that does Dragonkin damage (Celestial Dragon, etc.) and bring it to 20% by the third round.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kynriah</b></h3>I don't know if anyone else had this problem but when I tried to use my terrible turnip to get the oozeling to 1hp it actually killed it instead. I've never had that happen with any other battle pet except this one. Not sure if it's fixed or if this still happens :( Thankfully I was able to log out and try again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1078883</b></h3>First flew by the cave about two weeks ago. Saw the Oozling pop up on my map, flew down, one in the cave a the bottom.

Of course, I couldn't pet battle when in combat. When I tried to attack the invisible ooze it said &quot;you are too far away.&quot; Being lvl 89 I thought that was strange. I ran partway down the ramp and suddenly I was in range to kill it, wherever it was. Of course by that time somebody else had run up and gotten the pet. ):</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>846031</b></h3>I had come into the cave system yesterday and there were none at all. I left my toon parked at the lake-puddle deep inside the cave system, then came in when the zone was dark-of-night (about 1 am realm time). <br /><br />I wouldn't say there were tons of them, but there were enough.<br /><br />I would hazard a guess that the tooltip phrase &quot;at night&quot; is accurate, and that the timing of spawn is similar to the Deadwind Pass pet, <a href="/npc=61375/restless-shadeling">Restless Shadeling</a>.<br /><br />They <i>do</i> respawn, but not quickly. I was murdering maggots just for show (spell-killing), and occasionally an oozeling will show up.<br /><br />I did manage to see one respawn outdoors. When I have a chance I will upload the screenshot. It was very near the cave entrance. <br /><br />Good luck, everyone :D<br /><br />edit: not Arcane Eye (the normal deadwind pet)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bruenir</b></h3>I did not see any correlation, real or imagined between any activities I performed outside or inside the cave. I killed mobs, I killed maggots, I didn't kill them. I cycled around, I didn't cycle around. Two spawned, and other folks knew where they were going to spawn and got to them first. A third spawned after a long enough wait and I got there first and got an uncommon one. I would love there to be some direct correlation but without knowing more of the inner workings of the game, I think we're all just imagining things. My advice: go and wait in the cave as long as you can manage. One should eventually spawn. Kill stuff if you want. You should in theory have a tiny shot at one of the mobs dropping an <a href="/item=20768/oozing-bag">Oozing Bag</a> which could in theory contain a Disgusting Oozeling.</div>

It took best part of an hour before they started to spawn. <br /><br />I set up a target macro for &quot;Maggot&quot; with a cast Fel Flame so that I could instantly kill those that were in line of sight. So Yes killing maggots is the key.<br /><br />The three Jade Oozeling that spawned were all within the cave, first two poor quality level 11/12 respectively. The third to spawn was a rare level 12. <br /><br />The first spawned where the quest mob was, the second to the right cave area and the final to the left were the pool of water is. I fully expect this is as random as the RNG is. I was getting to the point of being disillusioned and thinking that they would never spawn but after the first the rest came after a short round of clearing out of maggots. <br /><br />Good Luck, may the RNG be with you.</div>

Neither the maggots inside the cave, not the oozes, are battle pets - so killing them makes no difference. However, I did find some maggots on the top of the cave which were battle pets - if you kill these + other battle pets around the area of the cave, oozlings will spawn INSIDE the cave.<br /><br />I didn't actually kill them in the normal way, I fought them with battle pets I am trying to level up - half an hour of this and three oozlings spawned inside the cave.</div>

So I would battle and kill for a hour or so and then look around the zone for other pets i need or another zone, come back check stay a half hour or so. Sometimes there be one most times not, until today, came back and there was three in the cave, two common (grey) and one uncommon (green) AND i have taken out nothing. What does this mean..LUCK is all it is here, do what ya want but getting an uncommon or rare is just luck I think.<br /><br />OK now see if i can get the rare. LOL</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rhaegaron</b></h3>The P/P breed has 325 Power, by selecting these abilities:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=449">Absorb</a></li><li><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=447">Corrosion</a></li><li><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=369">Acidic Goo</a></li></ul><br />You can do 1650 damage and retain a good amount of Health in 4 rounds.<br /><br />Round:<br /><ol><li>Acidic Goo</li><li>Corrosion</li><li>Absorb</li><li>Absorb</li></ol><br /><br />This mostly applies to PvE encounters since a PvP user can easily swap out or use avoidance, etc. The 25% damage increase for 3 rounds from Acidic Goo is often overlooked. Absorb can be swapped with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=445">Ooze Touch</a> for maximum amount of damage (1870) but you lose the healing benefit.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>daedelusikarius</b></h3>Confirmed cave entrance with so many oozlings is at coords 57, 38 near the river at the base of Skulk rock and before the river crossing to Seradane</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>melatwood</b></h3>I just finished capturing 3 uncommon and 2 Rare (took clearing the cave twice and allowing re-spawn). Battled and then left battle if not Rare. Their spawn rate is fairly quick these days.<br /><br />They are IN THE CAVE and AT THE MOUTH of the cave. Clearing mobs is irrelevant. Killing maggots <u>seemed</u> to help get them respawning. Cleared the maggots again and within 5-10 min they started spawning again.<br /><br />I found these lil guys all over going up in the cave and down in the cave. They spawned all over inside. I found 2 outside on the grass at the mouth and one in the mouth of the cave.<br /><br />See submitted screen shots</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>niknik1986</b></h3>Went at 9:10pm server time (Cairne) 11:10pm Est time. 2 Spawned out front of the cave.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>CzechCloud</b></h3>.They are spawning in the cave at 57.4, 38.55. Very common these days.</div>
