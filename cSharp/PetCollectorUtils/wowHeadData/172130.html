I didn't clear out anything, just hung out.<br />I took a molten corgi and two nexus whelplings. Corgi had enough to capture Clutch and get a few nips on the first Cruor. The whelplings blew them away with Mana Surge. Clutch is a cutie!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>beautifulsak</b></h3>Found at 30.61, 27.23</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>facetiousgerbil</b></h3>I saw one, and someone AOE'd it dead right as I tried to battle it. WHOOPS...<br /><br />Time to wait.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TheBacon2UrSoap</b></h3>I've been hanging around the pit in the House of Constructs for about 20 minutes and, not only have I not seen Clutch spawn, but I haven't seen a single critter in the pit at all, battle pet or otherwise. Is this normal..?<br />Also, I don't know if it makes a difference, but I cannot see hands sticking out of the ground in the pit anymore, either. All I see is the Baron patrolling the pit and the normal enemies around the outside of the pit. I have already completed the quests here.<br />EDIT: I did a couple of PVP pet battles and it randomly fixed itself when I came back; I can see critters and the hands again. Just an FYI if anyone else has this issue.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zamino</b></h3>If you don't get any pets at all spawning in the pit, like me, kill the ones to the south at 28:30 and 29:32.<br />I waited in the pit for like 20-30 minutes without any at all spawning, went south and killed all of those, right after that they started to spawn in the pit.<br />From there it took me like 5 minutes to get Clutch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Haworthia</b></h3>I spent some time looking for a spawn and killed critters inside the pit and did some pet battles that didn't have Clutch on the outer ring to spawn it but to no avail. Eventually ending up interacting with one of the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=165084/vestigial-animate">Vestigial Animate</a> limbs sticking out in the pit, which immediately spawned a Clutch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Georgino</b></h3>Don't wait the full time for the pet to respawn.<br />Just keep joining Maldraxxus quest groups through group finder and your pet will appear because of the shard switching.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zulonok</b></h3>I caught clutch and was battling the rest of the line and the baron somehow aggroed during my pet battle and kicked me out, clutch despawned. :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BMHunterMain</b></h3>Be aware that buggy aspects of pet battling that have hardly been a problem since MoP have made a comeback, and affect the capturing of this pet.<br /><br /><i>Baron Halis paths thru where these guys spawn, and he <b>WILL</b> pull you out of your pet battle after you've captured the pet, making you lose everything.</i><br /><br />Do yourself a favor... time this just right, enter the pet battle just after this slow-moving boss passes, and fight to nuke the two adds as fast as possible... or you might have a long wait killing critters, waiting on a respawn.<br /><br />You can also, depending on the exact place the pet spawns, possibly find a sweet spot, just out of Halis and other mobs' aggro range.</div>
