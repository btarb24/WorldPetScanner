The variables have been set to make the potential weather appropriate, meaning heavy showers are more likely in one region and drizzles in another. As Kaplan described it, the zone is practically asking itself whether there will be weather.[i] [b]\"It's sort of randomly picking: 'I'm ready to rain but do I want to rain?' \" he said. Duration will be chosen based on an automated system as well, with enough variables to make things unpredictable. [u]***\"We didn't want it to be such a mathematical formula that somebody could literally sit with a stopwatch, log in, go to a zone and go, 'OK in two, one, go â€” it's going to rain.'\"***[\/u][\/b][\/i][\/quote]\n\n[quote]The Storm Peaks have treacherous paths, powerful winds, jagged cliffs, and hungry monsters. They are also home to the storm giants, one of the oldest races in the world and the keepers of the titans' legacy. The two biggest dangers in the Storm Peaks arenâ€™t necessarily its inhabitants. The wind is fierce and constant, and can easily tug someone off a cliff. One look at those paths it has cut through the cliffs and one realizes how deadly wind can be. The second danger is sunlight. The peaks are covered in ice and the light reflects from every angle. Up here the ice is everywhere. Wearing dark glasses is the only way to survive â€” otherwise a person is blinded every time he moves his head, and before long he will take a misstep and tumble off a cliff or down a ravine. [i][b]The weather doesnâ€™t help â€” it is either clear and sunny, with the nasty glare, or dark as night and pouring, with sheets of freezing rain, hail, or snow battering down and making every surface as slick as oil.[\/b][\/i] [\/quote]\n\nFor those saying they caught one when it wasn't snowing:\n\nI am guessing you either caught them just as the snow was starting\/stopping, the pet may have wandered out of it's initial spawn area, or you just didn't notice the snow. Some of the snow is hard to see regardless of graphic settings. \n\n[u]Edit #1[\/u]: \nI personally found mine on the mountains flying from the Argent Tournament into Storm Peaks and it didn't seem to be snowing. As I engaged in battle, I could see the snow. It was [i]very light[\/i]. So [b][u]even flurries count[\/u][\/b] =)\n\n[u]Edit #2[\/u]:\n \n[b]Other Helpful Information[\/b]:\n[ul]\n[li]The areas in the zone will not always experience snow together (It's worth flying around and trying multiple spots). [\/li]\n[li]If you are having trouble seeing the snow\/weather, it helps to stick around dark\/shadowed areas where it's easier to see it. [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/item=64383\/kaldorei-wind-chimes]Kaldorei Wind Chimes[\/url] can be of great help here. (Thank you, Crystalinn, for the tip!)[\/li]\n[li]Phasing does not seem to be an issue with spawns EXCEPT for the Sons of Hodir quest line areas. [\/li]\n[li]CRZ's (cross realm zones) may cause you to see a bunch of spawns as you fly over, then when you land you find they've disappeared. This is frustrating, but normal. (Minfernal, I'm looking at you! *shakes fist*)[\/li]\n[\/ul]\n\n[u]Edit #3[\/u]: \nCleaned up the post's lack of capitalization. Happy collecting, fellow tamers!\n\n[u]Edit #4[\/u]: \nPeople are still asking about when it snows. Please read the first paragraph I quoted from Wowwiki. [u]The snow is random[\/u]. I highly suggest parking an alt or two in Storm Peaks and logging in on them to check once in a while for snow. You'll have a much better chance of catching it snowing that way. Remember to park them near a dark area or tree so you can see it better!\n\n[u]Edit #5:[\/u]\nIt has been mentioned that CRZ's [b]may[\/b] have a part in those seeing snow with no spawns. The idea behind this is that you are seeing snow from a different realm than yours. Try logging out and then back in. If someone would like to try and confirm this with a GM (screenshot, please!), that would be great. Even if this is true, just keep trying! Eventually you should come across snow from your home realm.

It snowed for the entire time. My advice to you in order to get this pet is to \"park\" one of your alts over the snowdrift plans and log in a few times a day. Chances are, you will log in during a snow storm at some point, even if it takes you a week or 2. Another tip is to not tell your guild or friends that it is snowing or else the word will spread and the competition will get rough. As a matter of fact, don't even talk about it in chat either.

It's 7 now and still snowing. \r\n\r\nCouple of notes I wanted to add here for additional confirmation:\r\nAfter getting my kit for the achievement, I tried flying around looking for a rare. The snow (which was very heavy in Snowblind Hills where I started) was extremely light in much of the rest of the zone. To the point that I had to stop moving to see the flurries were still going.\r\n\r\nI engaged combat with about 12 kits that I saw scattered around the zone. They were not \"all over the place\" as someone mentioned. I flew around the entirety of the zone and there were about 14 spawns up at the time. Of the 12, 2 were uncommon, 1 rare. \r\n\r\nAlso, since people are asking about how often it snows, I'll add my very small bit of info here; I started camping this pet 24 hours ago. I logged on to check if it was snowing about every 25 mins for the first 16 hours, then went to bed, woke up and 15 mins later it started snowing. But if you read other posts on weather, you'll find that the weather in game is generated completely at random. \r\n\r\nGood luck to all of you!\r\n\r\nAlso if I may add, a reminder.. if you're looking for your rare, you can engage in combat and then forfeit. If you forfeit, the spawn will reappear for the next guy who is trying to get his achievement. So, let's not scream about despawning them needlessly, unless people are actually killing the spawns nonstop trying to get a rare up. I use the forfeit method to find my rares, I refuse to screw someone else out of an achieve or pet they might have been working at for weeks or days or even hours.. their time is as valuable as mine.","date":"2013-04-07T07:11:52-05:00","rating":14,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":53,"id":1855539,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"HollyIsley","body":"In my search for the elusive Unborn Val'kyr I flew through Storm Peaks several times on different servers.

I checked this daily when my toon could get to Storm Peaks and never saw it snow.  Once I started questing there, it finally happened.  It took a few seconds for it to register... my first thought was, \"That snowfall looks really cool... it actually looks like it does when it snows here at home.  That's pretty good of them to make it.... WHAT?  IT'S SNOWING?  FINALLY!\".  Then, I giggled like a little girl and started hunting.\r\n\r\nHere's what I did and what I learned:\r\n\r\n[ol]\r\n[li]Yes.  It has to be snowing.  Period.[\/li]\r\n[li]I flew to every area where the map here shows they're found and engaged as many pets as I could and then surrendered.  I did this in hopes those pets would show up on the map here via the Wowhead addon, but without killing pets that others may need.  In doing this, I did find a rare, which made me pretty happy.[\/li]\r\n[li]It was snowing in EVERY AREA in Storm Peaks.  I found the fox kits in Snowdrift Plains, The Temple of Life area, Engine of Life area, Valkyrion area, Bor's Breath, and the area down by K3.[\/li]\r\n[li]When flying, you sometimes see the snow and you sometimes don't.  When I did see snow, it was very light.  When I stopped flying, it was heavy.[\/li]\r\n[li]When flying, altitude seemed to impact my ability to see snow, but not my minimap's ability to mark the battle pets.  The lower the altitude, the better I could see it.[\/li]\r\n[li]I'm still hovering over the K3 area as I type this and there's one of these right below me and it's still snowing, but very lightly.  I'd say it's been snowing for about 20 minutes by now.\r\n[\/ol]\r\n\r\nOn a side note, my graphics are set to Ultra, so YMMV when it comes to what you see versus what I saw.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think you can safely camp one area and not fly all over the zone looking for the weather to change.  If you're questing and in an area where it's not snowing, I think you can safely expect that it's not snowing somewhere else.  I also think you can safely expect to have enough time to fly around and find one of these if it does start snowing and you're in an area where they haven't spawned.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!","date":"2013-10-24T14:00:48-05:00","rating":25,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":65,"id":1912104,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Lyandria","body":"I just entered the Storm Peaks, checked the pet I was hunting \"Only available during snow\" ....\r\nDarn another one of those damn weather pets!

Snowfall is hard to see, so try setting your graphics to high if they are set otherwise. Also FLY LOW! -spotting the flurries from very high up is nearly impossible.\n\n2. Imcanter here says the duration of the snowfall was 45 minutes, someone else 20... I can't confirm on that. When I caught my kit it went on for about 10 minutes at most, then it ceased. So no idea really.\n\n3. Even if you can't see that it's snowing the green paw icons will show as usual on the mini map, so you can safely rely on that at least.\n\n4.[item=64383] Are extremely useful if you have them as they allow you to read the weather... (I guess they come in handy for catching other weather dependant pets!) They only fly in the ointment: they are a rare Archaelology item (Night Elf) *Thank you Crystalinn for the suggestion to use this item :)\n\n3. If you are very keen on getting your fox kit, rather than camping and running around the whole map I'd say set your hearthstone to K3. The plain just north of there was abundant with pets -whilst there be snow of course. (Again thanks to Valexani for location)\n\n4. Once you are ready to catch your pet I strongly suggest having a [npc=63365] on your team: [petability=826] is extremely useful at capturing pets since you are able to bring your target to 1 health without fear of killing it (the last thing you want to do!).

I have all my settings to max as I was paranoid I wouldn't see the snow after reading the other comments. What I can say about it is that when it snows it starts [i]very[\/i] lightly - maybe 10 flakes on the screen, it progressively gets heavier and seems to localise around your character. I tested this theory by flying away after it began snowing, as I flew it seemed to have stopped, so I stopped moving - the snow built up again. I looked back to where I was previously and I could see a localized blizzard.\r\n\r\nMy recommendations are to pick a spot where the foxes are known to spawn (snowdrift plains or snowblind hills have most recorded captures and are clipped by the flight paths of Vyragosa and TLPD) and just camp there. The kits spawn as soon as the code says \"SNOW!\" - before you can see it. I saw the green paw on my minimap before there was snow on screen (even the slight flurry business - this is why I tested the graphics after catching). \r\n\r\nI caught mine in front of the Dwarf\/Giant construct in Snowdrift Plains. Was just before 18:00 server time. I'd been camping the spot north of K3 for weeks previously (1-2 hour sessions at a time every other day or so), today I decided to be a bit more dedicated and moved between Snowdrift and Snowblind, eventually stopping for 2+ hours at Snowdrift.\r\n\r\nTo those still hunting can I ask a favour? Please strike up a conversation in general chat regarding if it's snowing - help each other to get this pet, even now there are people still hunting for it and it's pretty elusive\/random.

Now this pet can actually be pretty tricky to get now with cross realm zones, and connected realms, and the reason I say this is because in order for him to actually show up it must be snowing on your home realm. Since this is a connected realm and a cross realm zone you can actually end up seeing snow for other realms, but since it isn't snowing on your home realm you won't see the Arctic Fox Kit. I know this pet can be hard to get as it took me a couple weeks to get him, but if you just keep camping him out you will eventually get the snow for your home realm and get him to spawn for you. =) If there is anything else we can assist you with please let us know![\/quote]","date":"2014-10-29T16:45:18-05:00","rating":31,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":93,"id":2075104,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"1402117","body":"I don't know if something changed today, but I've been looking for this guy forever with no luck.

Every day I would log on with 3 of my alts, spread round the map and in areas where its indicated they spawn. Not once in the weeks and weeks have I seen any snow or pets :(\r\n\r\nSo I was trying to find more intel and found on another site, that quite a few people had left comments about logging on at 11pm (10pm to me, in UK) at K2 area. It was snowing and there were lots of Fox Kits spawned. So set my ingame alarm for 9:55pm, logged off my Main. Onto my K2 placed Alt, well blow me down with a feather, soon as I come out the inn, its snowing like mad, cant even see the wall on the other side of the courtyard. Spilled my coffee, in the excitement to get mounted ASAP, coffee left to run down desk and onto my legs, I don't care I need this pet. Soon as airborne, fly over the wall at K2 and low and behold 2 pet icons appear on the map (still not wanting to be disappointed again, i thought well they will be the skunks again)  move my mouse over to check and both Fox Kits, fly straight to nearest one and instigate battle. Its a green quality, I don't care I just need this pet. Battle goes well and I win, get my two achievements and still in shock. \r\n\r\nWell being there and one more pet icon to go, I think why not. Also put a General message out, to let all know there up and spawned . Start battle and its grey quality, but I win anyway. As I fly round the K2 site, just to see what numbers are like, I find no less than 11 other Fox Kits all in the flat area round K2 camp. \r\n\r\nSo the comments on the other site were right, I just wanted to let anyone know how I got on. Along with what seems to be a reasonably correct method of finding a pet. \r\n\r\nWishing you all the very best of luck and hope this strategy works for you ALL.","date":"2020-01-14T17:17:58-06:00","rating":13,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"This saved me!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>faeofwind</b></h3>It has to be <b><u><i>SNOWING</i></u></b> in the Storm Peaks to catch one of these!<br /><br />Information about weather and the Storm Peaks from Wowwiki:<br /><br /><div class="quote-box"><br />&quot;Instead, each sub-zone among the 11 where weather is currently available is now linked to a set of variables that allow for the possibility of precipitation. The variables have been set to make the potential weather appropriate, meaning heavy showers are more likely in one region and drizzles in another. As Kaplan described it, the zone is practically asking itself whether there will be weather.<i> <b>&quot;It's sort of randomly picking: 'I'm ready to rain but do I want to rain?' &quot; he said. Duration will be chosen based on an automated system as well, with enough variables to make things unpredictable. <u>***&quot;We didn't want it to be such a mathematical formula that somebody could literally sit with a stopwatch, log in, go to a zone and go, 'OK in two, one, go â€” it's going to rain.'&quot;***</u></b></i></div><br /><br /><div class="quote-box">The Storm Peaks have treacherous paths, powerful winds, jagged cliffs, and hungry monsters. They are also home to the storm giants, one of the oldest races in the world and the keepers of the titans' legacy. The two biggest dangers in the Storm Peaks arenâ€™t necessarily its inhabitants. The wind is fierce and constant, and can easily tug someone off a cliff. One look at those paths it has cut through the cliffs and one realizes how deadly wind can be. The second danger is sunlight. The peaks are covered in ice and the light reflects from every angle. Up here the ice is everywhere. Wearing dark glasses is the only way to survive â€” otherwise a person is blinded every time he moves his head, and before long he will take a misstep and tumble off a cliff or down a ravine. <i><b>The weather doesnâ€™t help â€” it is either clear and sunny, with the nasty glare, or dark as night and pouring, with sheets of freezing rain, hail, or snow battering down and making every surface as slick as oil.</b></i> </div><br /><br />For those saying they caught one when it wasn't snowing:<br /><br />I am guessing you either caught them just as the snow was starting/stopping, the pet may have wandered out of it's initial spawn area, or you just didn't notice the snow. Some of the snow is hard to see regardless of graphic settings. <br /><br /><u>Edit #1</u>: <br />I personally found mine on the mountains flying from the Argent Tournament into Storm Peaks and it didn't seem to be snowing. As I engaged in battle, I could see the snow. It was <i>very light</i>. So <b><u>even flurries count</u></b> =)<br /><br /><u>Edit #2</u>:<br /><br /><b>Other Helpful Information</b>:<br /><ul><li>The areas in the zone will not always experience snow together (It's worth flying around and trying multiple spots). </li><li>If you are having trouble seeing the snow/weather, it helps to stick around dark/shadowed areas where it's easier to see it. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=64383/kaldorei-wind-chimes">Kaldorei Wind Chimes</a> can be of great help here. (Thank you, Crystalinn, for the tip!)</li><li>Phasing does not seem to be an issue with spawns EXCEPT for the Sons of Hodir quest line areas. </li><li>CRZ's (cross realm zones) may cause you to see a bunch of spawns as you fly over, then when you land you find they've disappeared. This is frustrating, but normal. (Minfernal, I'm looking at you! *shakes fist*)</li></ul><br /><br /><u>Edit #3</u>: <br />Cleaned up the post's lack of capitalization. Happy collecting, fellow tamers!<br /><br /><u>Edit #4</u>: <br />People are still asking about when it snows. Please read the first paragraph I quoted from Wowwiki. <u>The snow is random</u>. I highly suggest parking an alt or two in Storm Peaks and logging in on them to check once in a while for snow. You'll have a much better chance of catching it snowing that way. Remember to park them near a dark area or tree so you can see it better!<br /><br /><u>Edit #5:</u><br />It has been mentioned that CRZ's <b>may</b> have a part in those seeing snow with no spawns. The idea behind this is that you are seeing snow from a different realm than yours. Try logging out and then back in. If someone would like to try and confirm this with a GM (screenshot, please!), that would be great. Even if this is true, just keep trying! Eventually you should come across snow from your home realm. Good luck, friends!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>eDGe87</b></h3>For the argumenting about them being up wether it's snowing or not:<br /><br />Could be that they spawn while it's snowing, and then are up for an X amount of time, even if it stops snowing.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1042064</b></h3>Happened to log in at a good time, it was snowing and I found a few of these. First one - uncommon, second one - rare. I guess I was pretty lucky, but anyway, there were even more, I just didn't fight them anymore.<br />And it wasn't after any kind of reset, so the blizzards can spawn at random times too (&quot;duh&quot;), so keep logging in every now and then :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Roesia</b></h3>Just logged in to my alt I left flying above Snowdrift Plains to find Storm Peaks in the height of a blizzard. It took one week of logging in for no more than 30-60 seconds per day before I happened on the snowy weather. I was able to catch two poor-quality foxes, but every single one of the 21 foxes I battled travelling the entire zone were ALL poor quality.<br /><br />On the up-side, 75% of those 21 foxes had a rare L22 Mountain Skunk as a second.<br /><br />The commenter, Hetel, was insanely lucky.....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1043733</b></h3>I have been working on my battle pet achievements instead of leveling my characters, as I feel that once everyone is done leveling/gearing up, they will start pet battling, hence making it really difficult to compete for rare pets such as this one. The cross realm feature isn't helping either. <br /><br />The Arctic fox kit is really giving me a run for my money. I've been &quot;parked&quot; above the snow drifts for days now and I have yet to see a snow storm. <br /><br />I feel that Blizzard is being unfair with the weather dependent pets. There are just too many of them. There should only be one weather pet as opposed to almost a dozen like the Baby Ape, Silithid Hatchling...to name a few. <br /><br />Good luck to all of us I guess and I will make sure to post an update with details if I catch one.<br /><br />Update: Ok so today I logged in at 12:00pm sharp and it seemed that it had just started to snow although Blizz claims that the weather pattern is random. The Arctic Fox kit started to spawn 2 minutes later. Circled the whole snowdrift plains a bunch of times and found approximately 25 foxes over the course of an hour and a half. I'm on Uldaman. It snowed for the entire time. My advice to you in order to get this pet is to &quot;park&quot; one of your alts over the snowdrift plans and log in a few times a day. Chances are, you will log in during a snow storm at some point, even if it takes you a week or 2. Another tip is to not tell your guild or friends that it is snowing or else the word will spread and the competition will get rough. As a matter of fact, don't even talk about it in chat either. Just keep battling and you will get your rare. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mcdisney2001</b></h3>Yes, it does have to be snowing for these to spawn. <u><b>No, you can't always see the snow!</b></u><br /><br />The snowstorm starts and ends VERY lightly; so lightly, in fact, that I saw no snowflakes whatsoever until I moved into the shadow of a tree. So go into the shadows if you want to be sure not to miss the very first (or last) flakes. This was even with the graphics on my computer set fairly high.<br /><br />At first, only two spawned at the southern location, but as the snow got heavier they were spawning on the spot everywhere there was level enough ground for them. The map above is accurate, but don't skip the spawn points that look less populated on the map; there are plenty in all of those spots once the snow starts coming down.<br /><br />I didn't keep track, but it probably took me around 15 fights to find a Rare. It was around 1 am server time on a week night, and there was no other competition. All I did was park a character on another server in a good spot, and check her real quick every once in awhile.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>916742</b></h3>I am sure this is simply reiterating what others have said but I got one today about 1300 server time, 1400 Central time. I logged in and it was BARELY snowing. I couldn't even tell it was snowing when I was flying. Nevertheless, there were flakes falling that hadn't been there any other time I logged in. <br /><br />I snatched the first one I saw (white), I didn't see a green until #12, and #15 produced a blue. I left for 5 minutes and returned to find all the fox spawns were now replaced with spiders and there was no snow. I was in storm peaks about 18 minutes. I logged in to find it snowing so I don't know how long it went total.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Audacity92</b></h3>Got mine around about 7:40am GMT+1 on the Snowdrift Plains.<br /><br />It helps a lot to log several characters out over these rare spawns and just log them periodically, only 3 rares left to go now!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aletheua</b></h3>To add my two cents, I did not and could not catch this pet unless it was <i>snowing</i> in Storm Peaks. I finally logged in right after a snow storm and caught the last one I saw in the zone. They are sneaky little devils.<br /><br />After trying for more than a week to get this little guy, I only caught a Poor Quality version of him, and during the week, frequently scanning the entire zone more than once a day, I can confirm to the best of my knowledge that you can not see them unless you are lucky enough to either log in during a snow storm, or just after.<br /><br />Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DoraTE</b></h3>These are the only battle pets that spawn as first pets in Storm Peaks. So if you see a battle pet on the minimap it will be an Arctic Fox Kit with two other pets. I battled about 12, and the best I saw was a common quality one, but I did pick up a rare Arctic Hare, and a rare Highlands Skunk.<br /><br />Capturing this pet, or one of its companions is needed for the northrend tamer achievement. <br /><br />Pro tip, bind interact with target to a key, then button mash that key moving around whilst you have the pet targeted. Especially good for those on the sides of hills.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DarthEnder</b></h3>Just a quick question about knowing if it's snowing.<br /><br />Now, in storm peaks, if I look up, I can see the stars. Even during the daytime.<br /><br />Is this true even during snow? Or does the sky at least cloud over?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mushalor</b></h3>No one else seems to be mentioning an important and unpleasant fact that I discovered today upon seeing snow: questing phases affect your ability to nab these. Several areas I never quested in on any of my characters, including Frostfield and the area with the polar bear dailies. Dozens of spawns, and no way to reach them upon landing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xella</b></h3>Keep in mind thatâ€”just like Jaguero Isle vs. the rest of the Cape of Stranglethorn for the Baby Apeâ€”each sub-zone's weather is different. If it's not snowing in Snowdrift Plains, check by the Temple of Life or K3, or vice verse. A few minutes of extra flying around might save you hours of alt/server hopping!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>683070</b></h3>The good news is that when it is snowing, these pets are fairly common.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1057602</b></h3>Just caught several of these, while it was snowing in Storm Peaks on a Friday night at 11:30-ish until 11:55p.m. <br />Right when it hit 11:55 the arctic hare I was about to dual with vanished. At some points I could couldn't see the blizzard going on. You will have to look around if you keep a toon parked there.<br /><br />From what I could see, you only have about a 25 minute window to capture your battle pet. I caught 2 uncommon s and several lesser grades; however, I did go into battle to find a rare Arctic Hare and a rare Spider. Sadly, I already had three arctic hares so I had to settle for the more commonly found rare spider.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>m4zurka</b></h3>look carefully because it's possible to miss the fact that it's snowing, at least with my graphics settings. i didn't think i saw any snow when i landed at the windrider, and as i got on my mount and flew around a bit i could just see a couple of snowflakes here and there. only when i stopped moving did it look like it was really coming down. i found a poor quality one right away and killed it by accident with a critical hit :(. i had to fly around for a while to find another, but as luck would have it the second one i found was a rare!<br /><br />happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cupcakey</b></h3>Just got my foxy! <br /><br />I logged on for a second before bed to check on my toons parked in Tanaris, that island where the baby apes are, and Storm Peaks. Didn't see any weather at the first two places, or in Storm Peaks. Then, just as I was about to hit esc to log off (about 1:35 am PST), I see the snow coming down! I started frantically flying around and didn't see any pets! For about 6 minutes I flew around southern Storm Peaks with no paws. I checked my Track Pets, it was checked. I landed and flew back up, still no pets. So, a little disheartened, I started flying around the rest of Storm Peaks. Finally at 1:48 I saw it! One lonely green paw in the northwest area near Val-whateveritscalled. Made sure I had 3 level 25 pets ready to go (can't take any chances!) and finally got my fox kit and Northrend achievement. It's poor quality, but I saved a stone just for it!<br /><br />Some have commented that when it starts to snow these pets are abundant. There were about 4 other toons flying around Snowblind Hills with me searching, but I don't think they saw any fox kits either. Long story short, if it starts snowing and you don't see any pets in your immediate area, fly around everywhere you can! <br /><br />Also, in retrospect, I might have chosen to park my toon in an area other than K-3/Snowblind Hills, since most people probably look there first as well. Good luck on your hunt!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>694270</b></h3>I couldn't see the snow unless I was still. From Low to Good settings it was the same, though on Good I have lag so I didn't keep it there. Kind of confusing, although you can find plenty if you fly around enough you can fly for a little bit and see no Kits and wonder, is it still snowing? Then you stop and it is. Though they are spread out a bit it seems I saw plenty until I caught a rare and left. Another one to park an alt for and check periodically. Though I flew here after I caught a Silithid Hatchling and it was snowing as it was still storming in the other area. It may be a coincidence but I still say its worth it to check.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>244088</b></h3>It looks like the spawn time of Arctic Fox Kit is now shorter. Every time I visit Storm Peaks and traverse the TLPD spawn route, there are multiple spawns of AFK. I did this on different times of the day confirming my observation. Some of the time it wasn't snowing at all. Needlessly, I could not get anymore of this pet as I already have 3 rares.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Teevo</b></h3>Something I noticed was that it doesn't snow all over Storm Peaks. It snows in little areas all over the zone.. some more heavily than others. This is something that I believe is being overlooked or misinterpreted.<br /><br />So for people saying they got theirs when it wasnt snowing, the pet could very well have wandered out of the snowing area. But the fact remains that it needs to be snowing for them to spawn.<br /><br />Got my rare version after about a dozen this past weekend. Flew all over the zone, <u>some areas were snowing while some were not.</u> But the zone had snow nonetheless. The dots on the map above are pretty accurate for the most part, so I'd still recommend using the map as a general guide.<br /><br />Also, I would note the snow isn't as easy to spot as one might think. My graphics are by no means low, and it was definitely tricky to the eye at certain times.. while other times it was fairly easy to see.<br /><br />So if you're after this guy, dont just fly in to Storm Peaks on the very border and leave if its not snowing (like I did for a week straight). It may very well be snowing but you wouldnt know it til you flew around a bit!</div>

WHOLE storm peaks had snow, so its kinda random ( ie for some it is snowing in some sub zone, for others it is snowing in the whole zone). I did 1 full circle on hot spots, about 25fights with no luck on rare. When i started on doing 2nd circle - rare has spawned, yay! Still took me ~30mins. After the catch i still was in zone to check out time lost drake and snow stopped at ~02.30.<br />To get this little bugger i parked 3 characters on different realms and was checking 3-4 times a day.So its a very good idea to park different characaters in there. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zinseng</b></h3>Woke up this morning and it happened to be snowing at 6:45 st. It's 7 now and still snowing. <br /><br />Couple of notes I wanted to add here for additional confirmation:<br />After getting my kit for the achievement, I tried flying around looking for a rare. The snow (which was very heavy in Snowblind Hills where I started) was extremely light in much of the rest of the zone. To the point that I had to stop moving to see the flurries were still going.<br /><br />I engaged combat with about 12 kits that I saw scattered around the zone. They were not &quot;all over the place&quot; as someone mentioned. I flew around the entirety of the zone and there were about 14 spawns up at the time. Of the 12, 2 were uncommon, 1 rare. <br /><br />Also, since people are asking about how often it snows, I'll add my very small bit of info here; I started camping this pet 24 hours ago. I logged on to check if it was snowing about every 25 mins for the first 16 hours, then went to bed, woke up and 15 mins later it started snowing. But if you read other posts on weather, you'll find that the weather in game is generated completely at random. <br /><br />Good luck to all of you!<br /><br />Also if I may add, a reminder.. if you're looking for your rare, you can engage in combat and then forfeit. If you forfeit, the spawn will reappear for the next guy who is trying to get his achievement. So, let's not scream about despawning them needlessly, unless people are actually killing the spawns nonstop trying to get a rare up. I use the forfeit method to find my rares, I refuse to screw someone else out of an achieve or pet they might have been working at for weeks or days or even hours.. their time is as valuable as mine.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>HollyIsley</b></h3>In my search for the elusive Unborn Val'kyr I flew through Storm Peaks several times on different servers. I noticed numerous kits around without it snowing in the sub-zones I was in at the time. Maybe Blizzard changed the requirement for this pet, or maybe it's glitched due to the patch...either way I'd come get one if you need it before it is changed again. I am currently looking at one without a single snowflake visible at 27.34 / 44.92 in the Snowdrift Plains. I am on Shandris, but who knows which coalesced realm I am in because of CRZ. It is 3:37am realm time according to the clock on my minimap.</div>

(note: the Val'kyr spawns in 3 spots in EACH northrend zone! However, for your hunting purposes for the fox kit, I figured why not add the points for another super rare pet so you can check it along the way? The Unborn Val'kyr does spawn in other zones I just only included the spawn points for storm peaks.)

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Amallah</b></h3>After spending the majority of the time yesterday searching around Storm Peaks on two different servers, as well as an hour or so this morning, I've come to the conclusion that the Arctic Fox Kit is simply a phantom created by Blizzard in an attempt to drive me to insanity, and all of you are in on it. It's all so clear to me, now... Pull me in with the promise of pets and achievements, and with just one single non-existent entity, rip it all away from me. There is no Arctic Fox Kit, as I found out today. There is no chance of snow in The Storm Peaks.<br /><br />I've also come to the harsh conclusion that the lack of weather in The Storm Peaks is a dangerous sign that global warming has penetrated the World... of Warcraft. The ice caps of Northrend are in danger of melting, and so I call upon you now to aid us in the restoration of global temperatures! Stop using mechano-hogs/choppers, stop using mechastriders, stop using motorized transportation! In the end, it all adds up to destruction! Heed my call now, all you who venture the World!<br /><br />And now, I shall go check myself into the nearest mental facility and request a cat scan, as I'm sure this stunt by Blizzard has left permanent damage on my psyche.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>622477</b></h3>Weather dependent. Must be snowing.<br /><br />After hanging out in Storm Peaks for several days. It finally snowed.<br /><br />Lasted for 45 minutes. Was easily able to find once it started to snow.<br /><br />I battled 5 fox kits. 3 poor, 1 uncommon, 1 rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kas92</b></h3>Just got mine today also.<br />I've been looking for snow for days now..<br />Its true, the snow is not always visible..<br />So don't bother looking for the weather, <br />just go somewhere the fox kit spawns and see if the pet is there!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DentargWonko</b></h3>As mentioned before, it has to be snowing to get this pet. I checked this daily when my toon could get to Storm Peaks and never saw it snow. Once I started questing there, it finally happened. It took a few seconds for it to register... my first thought was, &quot;That snowfall looks really cool... it actually looks like it does when it snows here at home. That's pretty good of them to make it.... WHAT? IT'S SNOWING? FINALLY!&quot;. Then, I giggled like a little girl and started hunting.<br /><br />Here's what I did and what I learned:<br /><br /><ol><li>Yes. It has to be snowing. Period.</li><li>I flew to every area where the map here shows they're found and engaged as many pets as I could and then surrendered. I did this in hopes those pets would show up on the map here via the Wowhead addon, but without killing pets that others may need. In doing this, I did find a rare, which made me pretty happy.</li><li>It was snowing in EVERY AREA in Storm Peaks. I found the fox kits in Snowdrift Plains, The Temple of Life area, Engine of Life area, Valkyrion area, Bor's Breath, and the area down by K3.</li><li>When flying, you sometimes see the snow and you sometimes don't. When I did see snow, it was very light. When I stopped flying, it was heavy.</li><li>When flying, altitude seemed to impact my ability to see snow, but not my minimap's ability to mark the battle pets. The lower the altitude, the better I could see it.</li></ol><br /><br />On a side note, my graphics are set to Ultra, so YMMV when it comes to what you see versus what I saw.<br /><br />However, I think you can safely camp one area and not fly all over the zone looking for the weather to change. If you're questing and in an area where it's not snowing, I think you can safely expect that it's not snowing somewhere else. I also think you can safely expect to have enough time to fly around and find one of these if it does start snowing and you're in an area where they haven't spawned.<br /><br />Hope this helps!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lyandria</b></h3>I just entered the Storm Peaks, checked the pet I was hunting &quot;Only available during snow&quot; ....<br />Darn another one of those damn weather pets! Wait... what the.. ?<br />*Starting to snow literally 20 seconds after I entered storm peaks*<br />Yay! Fly down to ground and take a random arctic fox kit to fight... it's a bloody rare!<br />Yes, I was happy, and I doubt I will ever be this lucky again in my entire life! ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1037209</b></h3>After reading most of the comments here are some important points to keep in mind:<br /><br />1. Snowfall is hard to see, so try setting your graphics to high if they are set otherwise. Also FLY LOW! -spotting the flurries from very high up is nearly impossible.<br /><br />2. Imcanter here says the duration of the snowfall was 45 minutes, someone else 20... I can't confirm on that. When I caught my kit it went on for about 10 minutes at most, then it ceased. So no idea really.<br /><br />3. Even if you can't see that it's snowing the green paw icons will show as usual on the mini map, so you can safely rely on that at least.<br /><br />4.<a href="/item=64383/kaldorei-wind-chimes">Kaldorei Wind Chimes</a> Are extremely useful if you have them as they allow you to read the weather... (I guess they come in handy for catching other weather dependant pets!) They only fly in the ointment: they are a rare Archaelology item (Night Elf) *Thank you Crystalinn for the suggestion to use this item :)<br /><br />3. If you are very keen on getting your fox kit, rather than camping and running around the whole map I'd say set your hearthstone to K3. The plain just north of there was abundant with pets -whilst there be snow of course. (Again thanks to Valexani for location)<br /><br />4. Once you are ready to catch your pet I strongly suggest having a <a href="/npc=63365/terrible-turnip">Terrible Turnip</a> on your team: <a href="/pet-ability=826/weakening-blow">Weakening Blow</a> is extremely useful at capturing pets since you are able to bring your target to 1 health without fear of killing it (the last thing you want to do!). With that your pet trap can't miss!<br /><br />Happy Hunting and Good Luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>toddster77</b></h3>When it does snow is it the whole zone or just a localized area?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wakamaru</b></h3>Finally picked one of these up immediately following rolling restarts for all servers. Caelestrasz-US, Storm Peaks - The Summit. Grabbed the first one I spotted just for good measure, then found a rare 2 more Kits later.<br /><br />Prior to this, I have posted an alt in the zone to check back with regularly. Over the course of a few weeks, I never saw snow nor foxes with that character until right after the server restart.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>authoritynone01</b></h3>I happened to get extremely lucky and picked up a rare 3 kills in.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>opalexian</b></h3>FINALLY<br /><br />7 Dec 13, 2:15p, Twisting Nether-<br /><br />guildie let me know they were up, I had enough time to switch toons and port up (thank god for the Argent tabard!) and got a blue on my third go :D<br /><br />It is still snowing 15 minutes later so I guess the snow time can vary greatly from the comments I've read. Also, when I got here the snow was very obvious but now it's down to a light flurry you can't see unless you're standing still, so stop occasionally if you're not sure if it's snowing as well.<br /><br />Out of curiosity went to Jaguaro to look for the ape and it wasn't raining, so doubtful that they have any correlation just FYI.<br /><br />FINALLY YOU DAMN FOX! *fistshake*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Depressionrogue</b></h3>Hello mates. There's something I'd like to share with you everyone. My in-game name is Depression and I heard my issue would somehow fit in my name. First things first;<br /><br /><u>Have fun trying to solve <b>What does the fox say.</b> It is indeed an ancient mystery.</u><br /><br />but quess what.. <br /><br />You may find it rather odd for me to farm this long time for a friggin tiny, useless and most of everything the rarest pet in the world, they said. *cough*<br /><br />I've been farming for 52hours, I've had 3.5hours sleep and if you tell me it has been snowing during the time I've slept blizzard is.. wait ? what blizzard and end of the story. <br /><br />I made a ticket conserning the randomly generating weather thing and there MIGHT be a little problems with it, so the <i><b>question is.. How often does it snow might cling to someones head?</b></i> How messed up can it be it isnt snowing? Afterall I'm at the famous so called &quot;Storm&quot; peaks. Quote from edited ticket; <br /><div class="quote-box">50 hours no snowing during this time. Rather odd. And yes I play these graphics on ultra so I can see the snow, oh wait... what snow?</div><br /><br />I understand, here in Finland it hasnt been snowing at all during the christmas not to mention christmas eve, and betweem that and what so ever... WHAT A COINCIDENCE! <br /><br />&quot;Storm&quot; peaks should be looking a little pale by now according to the amount of snow there has been lately, just like here, in Finland. I'm amazed how it can be so stormy in there. I recall hearing something what makes &quot;storm&quot; peaks so dangerous, and no wonder! Please if you can avoid going to the &quot;storm&quot; peaks I'd hereby suggest you to stay away from there, bad things happen in there. It's dangerous and very stormy there. <i>(Where did all that snow get in there btw?)</i><br /><br />I have a theory.. It isn't snow. It's poo and you can blame it on the dwarves. Regards a Belf Horde.<br /><br />And to the point, If you're trying to catch arctic fox kit I feel from the bottom of my heart pity on you. Please remember how much I was having fun while farming for this pet;<br />-I havent encountered a SINGLE <b>Arctic fox kit</b> in <u>52 hours of farming</u>, 3.5hours breaks in total. (sleep) and loooots of hours of playing awaiting me I assume. <br /><br />Someone may or may not have been lucky with this one, like me? but I only know people that has visited in storm peaks and got their arctic fox kit. I'm farming for this in order to get my achievement.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kimnana</b></h3>Not sure if this will help anyone but after searching for this elusive pet for 4 long agonizing months I happened to be at the right place at the right TIME. This creature will only appear if it is snowing. I was beginning to think that it never snowed in Storm Peaks. <br /><br />It snows on Saturday mornings from between 9:00 and 10:30. I went back on following Saturdays to verify the snow time and it does appear that it snows about this time. <br /><br />If anyone can add additional times or verify this for others I'm sure they will be grateful. I know it could have saved me a lot of pain. Good Luck in your search!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1188545</b></h3>Since weather is realm dependable, one good way to increase the chance to experience snowing in Storm Peaks is to use oQueue addon and get in groups on different realms.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>geekygirlish</b></h3>Seriously, for all the accumulated snow on the ground in the Storm Peaks, it never seems to snow!<br /><br />I finally got this elusive pet taking a short cut thru the peaks and happened to see an orc pet battling and moused over to see what it was. A fox kit! He then killed it, and not in a pet battle way. I sobbed over its poor dead common corpse. It didn't appear to be snowing so I figured it was a left over. Mounted up and carried on and there up the hill was another! Again, it didn't look like it was snowing and it was only a poor but I grabbed him and got the ach. <br /><br />And for all the PITA this pet is to get, couldn't Blizz at least added one cool move instead of it being an exact talent set of every other fox?<br /><br />ETA: got an upvote notification and came here to see this was downvoted? Not sure why someone has issue with this very old comment</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thrope</b></h3>Only moments ago I was flying around the NW Val'kyr spawnpoint and noticed 3 of these little guys wandering around, yet it wasn't snowing. I landed, just to be sure: still no FALLING sow. I recall how elusive mine was to catch, signing in on alts for ages to check if it was snowing, so I checked here for any mention of Bliz nerfing the requirements for this pet.<br /><br />I really don't know what to make of it. About 32, 48 and not snowing (but the game seems to think it's snowing), 3 spawns, 14:40ish realm time on Caelestrasz. For what it's worth. No idea if this will help anyone who has yet to catch this pet, but I guess... don't immediately rule it out if you don't see snowfall.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Opalskye</b></h3>The snow graphic is an oddity! I have all my settings to max as I was paranoid I wouldn't see the snow after reading the other comments. What I can say about it is that when it snows it starts <i>very</i> lightly - maybe 10 flakes on the screen, it progressively gets heavier and seems to localise around your character. I tested this theory by flying away after it began snowing, as I flew it seemed to have stopped, so I stopped moving - the snow built up again. I looked back to where I was previously and I could see a localized blizzard.<br /><br />My recommendations are to pick a spot where the foxes are known to spawn (snowdrift plains or snowblind hills have most recorded captures and are clipped by the flight paths of Vyragosa and TLPD) and just camp there. The kits spawn as soon as the code says &quot;SNOW!&quot; - before you can see it. I saw the green paw on my minimap before there was snow on screen (even the slight flurry business - this is why I tested the graphics after catching). <br /><br />I caught mine in front of the Dwarf/Giant construct in Snowdrift Plains. Was just before 18:00 server time. I'd been camping the spot north of K3 for weeks previously (1-2 hour sessions at a time every other day or so), today I decided to be a bit more dedicated and moved between Snowdrift and Snowblind, eventually stopping for 2+ hours at Snowdrift.<br /><br />To those still hunting can I ask a favour? Please strike up a conversation in general chat regarding if it's snowing - help each other to get this pet, even now there are people still hunting for it and it's pretty elusive/random. It was great to see some team spirit today on the Azuremyst/Stormrage EU CRZ battlegroup, lots of people helping each other out :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nimrod</b></h3>First time I've seen it snowing in Storm Peaks in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />No fox kits anywhere in the zone, and no other player activity that I've seen (and nobody responded in general chat).<br /><br />Getting tired of these CRZ bugs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>hurleur</b></h3>For anyone trying to farm for this little devil.<br /><br />I recently opened a ticket asking why it was snowing in the Storm Peaks but there were no kits to be seen anywhere.<br />This is the response I got:<br /><div class="quote-box">Looking over your ticket here i understand you're having some problems getting the Arctic Fox Kit. Now this pet can actually be pretty tricky to get now with cross realm zones, and connected realms, and the reason I say this is because in order for him to actually show up it must be snowing on your home realm. Since this is a connected realm and a cross realm zone you can actually end up seeing snow for other realms, but since it isn't snowing on your home realm you won't see the Arctic Fox Kit. I know this pet can be hard to get as it took me a couple weeks to get him, but if you just keep camping him out you will eventually get the snow for your home realm and get him to spawn for you. =) If there is anything else we can assist you with please let us know!</div></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1446747</b></h3>I logged on tonight at around 7:25pm server time and it just happened to be snowing! There they were, arctic fox kit pets all over central Storm Peaks! I was curious to see how long the snowstorm (weather) would last so I continued to track them down and capture them until the snowstorm stopped. At 8:25pm server time the snow stopped and I ended up with a level 20 rare Arctic Fox Kit and 2 level 21 uncommon Arctic Fox Kits. While it's said that it's completely random, (the time of occurrence and the length of time that the snowy weather begins), it was practically an hour in my case and it was just shy of the mid hour. I hope this helps anyone in search of this awesome pet, happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BlizzardCS</b></h3>Hello, pet collectors!<br /><br />At the moment thereâ€™s an issue related to this pet.

I see snow in the air and think HOORAY! <br /><br />Then I can't find any of these little cretins. I came back on here and looked at the screenshots rather than the comments and discovered you can actually see snowflakes (or I'm hoping I will be able to).<br /><br />I can't play with the graphics turned up to max so in the distance it looks kinda fuzzy, or is that snowy? Its hard to tell.<br /><br />When I got the ape pet in Stranglethorn I had to wait for rain. I cranked up the volume and did housework and when it rained it was very obviously raining. Snow is so soft so no weather sound alert. I couldn't even find an addon that would alert me when it rains/snows/windstorms etc.<br /><br />I guess this is gunna take a while.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>nirv</b></h3>Some people have said it only snows in Storm Peaks in the evenings.

I kept an alphabetized spreadsheet handy so I knew which servers I had joined. Just as I was about to give up, I joined Area-52 and immediately the green paw symbol showed up on my mini-map.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1533292</b></h3><b>Park an alt or two in several spots around storm peaks, logging in a few times just to check now and then.</b> Don't worry too much about seeing or not seeing the snow if you are running ultra graphics. There are varying degrees of the snow, the heavy snow is similar to the snow that you will see when it snows in the horde garrison. They spawn all over zone and you might see a different pet, but most of them will be the fox kit. I caught mine in <b>snowdrift plains</b> at 12:20 am pst. I found snowy weather again a couple weeks later flying through the area and it was in the afternoon. Fox kits everywhere, didn't find a rare but doesn't matter now with the WoD expansion and the rare battle stones that apply to any family of pet. I do NOT recommend waiting for hours at a time for the snow, you will be wasting your time. Park your alts and log in and out every so often or you will go mad from waiting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rapinii</b></h3>Weird, I started realm hopping to find this pet, and I ended up on a realm where there's a lot of them at the Snowdrift Plains even though it's not snowing? My graphics/particles option is high too, and I've tried moving from zone to zone to make the snow appear and it just hasn't. <br /><br />Oh well, I'm hunting for my rare right now. Not gonna complain. If you're having trouble finding this pet and you're realm hopping for it, make sure you check around for the spawns even if you don't see the weather effect. I've made sure they were not just left-over spawns from a previous snowstorm, because I keep killing them as I hunt for my rare and they respawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nevarii</b></h3>Just got my Arctic Fox Kit for the Northrend Safari achievement. It was my second time checking Storm Peaks for the pet and actually I didn't see the snow at first. I was a bit high over the ground but then I saw an Arctic Fox Kit on the minimap and flew down. The snow appeared for me when I landed. After I got the pet I checked the snow which was still there until I flew too far up. For some reason you don't see the snow if you are a bit too high up in the air. At least I needed to fly a bit close to the ground or walk directly on the ground before the snow appeared for me. It is a bit tricky but at least you can see the pet on the minimap with your &quot;Track pets&quot; :) <br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>usulnet</b></h3>I was finally able to get an Arctic Fox Kit today. I have to say even with graphics all the way up I could not see the snow at all unless I was pet battling. Your best bet is to track pets and mouse-over the targets and/or use a targeting macro to look for them. Otherwise you risk passing them by if you're simply looking for it to be snowing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ZuugZuug</b></h3>The <a href="/npc=62864/arctic-fox-kit">Arctic Fox Kit</a> can be found in <a href="/zone=67/the-storm-peaks">The Storm Peaks</a> &quot;ONLY&quot; when it is snowing. Some comments say it was not snowing when they caught one. This is likely because they did not have their graphics cranked up. I found one and it was not snowing, BUT I turned my <b>&quot;Particle Density&quot;</b> up to High, and I was then able to see that it &quot;was&quot; in fact snowing. So I highly recommend turning up your particle density while looking for this pet. Also, as soon as it stopped snowing all of the Foxes disappeared, so they do not linger after it snows. Hope this helps!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>chuilovestoads</b></h3>Just spent a wasted 45 minutes flying around in the snow for no foxes to ever spawn. First and only time in 6 months I've managed to even see snow in the Storm Peaks, and no foxes. So, I come here, see comments about CRZ, so I try relogging, hoping that would help. It doesn't. I tried killing the non-rare pets, like spiders and such, hoping I could maybe force something new to spawn. No luck. In the end, the snow ended, and no fox ever appeared anywhere in the zone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>pmff</b></h3>FINALLY caught this little bean after years of endless hunts and adjusting video quality hoping that it was snowing and I just couldn't see it...Half expected to find Time-Lost too since my luck seems so good today (but of course, I didn't).<br /><br />Some info on my catch:<br />- I have done no quests in this zone on this character and encountered no phasing issues. While hunting previously on a character who had done the whole zone, I fought other pets successfully in the area with no phasing problems, but spawn locations may be different and may cause issues.<br />- I caught it just before noon server time right after server maintenance, unsure if that affects the snow timer since it's meant to be fully random, but worth a shot if you're still looking! <br />- The first one I caught was poor quality since I was just worried he'd disappear before my eyes after so many unsuccessful trips, but after ~15 or so battles I was able to find a rare.<br />- I did check the rest of the zone to see if it was snowing as I'd read that different parts of the zone can snow at a time and found the whole zone was snowing. I'm not sure if that was false/outdated info or if it just happened to all be snowing.<br /><br />Hopefully some or all of this info was helpful to you, happy hunting, friends!<br /><br />I also submitted a screenshot for the first one I found so you can see the snow in the background, but with even decent video settings it seems fairly obvious if you move your camera to dark areas.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>RavenUK</b></h3>Hi all, I had been after this pet (my last for Northrend and Zookeeper) for a few months now. Every day I would log on with 3 of my alts, spread round the map and in areas where its indicated they spawn. Not once in the weeks and weeks have I seen any snow or pets :(<br /><br />So I was trying to find more intel and found on another site, that quite a few people had left comments about logging on at 11pm (10pm to me, in UK) at K2 area. It was snowing and there were lots of Fox Kits spawned. So set my ingame alarm for 9:55pm, logged off my Main. Onto my K2 placed Alt, well blow me down with a feather, soon as I come out the inn, its snowing like mad, cant even see the wall on the other side of the courtyard. Spilled my coffee, in the excitement to get mounted ASAP, coffee left to run down desk and onto my legs, I don't care I need this pet. Soon as airborne, fly over the wall at K2 and low and behold 2 pet icons appear on the map (still not wanting to be disappointed again, i thought well they will be the skunks again) move my mouse over to check and both Fox Kits, fly straight to nearest one and instigate battle. Its a green quality, I don't care I just need this pet. Battle goes well and I win, get my two achievements and still in shock. <br /><br />Well being there and one more pet icon to go, I think why not. Also put a General message out, to let all know there up and spawned . Start battle and its grey quality, but I win anyway. As I fly round the K2 site, just to see what numbers are like, I find no less than 11 other Fox Kits all in the flat area round K2 camp. <br /><br />So the comments on the other site were right, I just wanted to let anyone know how I got on. Along with what seems to be a reasonably correct method of finding a pet. <br /><br />Wishing you all the very best of luck and hope this strategy works for you ALL.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Alauraa</b></h3>For me, After months of trying to get this pet. It finally snowed in Stormpeaks. <br />I also noticed that it snowed all over stormpeaks, while other posts say this is not true.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>thehebrewhand</b></h3>If it helps anyone, I finally got my Arctic Fox Kit after logging in and finding that it was snowing in Stormwind. Because it's uncommon for that to happen as well, I decided to drop everything and port to Northrend to check on the Storm Peaks for snow, just in case. It took a few minutes to get there, and at first I figured &quot;no correlation&quot;. As some people have said though, sometimes its not totally apparent that it's snowing (dependent upon a person's graphic's settings), so I took a better look at the screen, realized that it <b><i>was</i></b> snowing, searched a bit longer, and started seeing the foxes pop up all over!<br /><br />I do want to be clear, this doesn't necessarily mean that the weathers in Stormwind and the Storm Peaks are linked or correlated, but if anyone wants to check, it may help to try checking up there if it's raining in SW!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nileve5</b></h3>So I did everything correctly. I had alt camping there and decided to check it, it was snowing, my <a href="/item=64383/kaldorei-wind-chimes">Kaldorei Wind Chimes</a> said that too. I started to check the spawn points, and not a single fox was up, the zone was deserted. I killed every other critters and battle pets in the zone for two hours, to make them spawm, but they didn't. I checked all the spawn points couple of times. I was on my own realm without any group finders or anything like that. The interesting part is that I checked the same realm from my main and no snowing, even the <a href="/item=64383/kaldorei-wind-chimes">Kaldorei Wind Chimes</a> said that was no snow. I did relog and restart the game couple of times to see this, and again no groups or anything like that. So same realm, same zone, different sharding on my characters and different weathers. But if the weather is correct it is still not up.<br />The snow though seems an updated animation, so I really think this is bugged. And it was snowing in all zones not long ago due to a bug.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SilkCharm</b></h3>2021 experience: Logged in at 9am server time (Feathermoon US) and it was SNOWING - yay! - but no pets. Nowhere. Snowed for at least an hour, I logged out and in and multiple characters were dragged there and I flew all over the zone and in and out of the zone trying to reset it. Gave up. <br />Logged in at 9pm server time same day (today) same server, and it was snowing lightly (less than this morning) Grabbed a Rare on my 3rd fight :) <br />Definitely some phasing this morning as mobs were coming and going but I wasn't realm hopping and I logged out COMPLETELY and restarted Battlenet and it still mucked up. FYI NW near the flight master is where I found 3 of them including the rare. Also, I run add-on NPC Time to check how long the uptime has been. In both cases my logging in had triggered the zone to come out of hibernation so the NPCs (even unkillables) showed Alive: 4 minutes 3 seconds etc. Not sure that helps anyone :)</div>

As a Midwesterner, I would call it a light snow with small flakes. It's been snowing for at least 20 minutes, now.<br /><br />It takes about 10 seconds after logging in for the snow to actually appear (due to loading time perhaps?).<br /><br />/way 67.13 45.06 West side - overlook<br />/way 28.17 45.93 East side - crane<br />/way 40.04 82.25 South side - boulder<br />NPCScan ID: 62864<br /><br />All of the foxes I saw were poor quality (initiated battles with 8-10 foxes).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thekillerrabbit</b></h3>Recently got into pet collecting so decided to go for this one. Started by randomly logging in and out of several trial toons on different low pop realms throughout the day. Caught it snowing a handful of times but there were NO Arctic Fox Kits. Zero. I flew around to every spawn point multiple times.<br /><br />I wondered if the trial characters were the problem-- even though they had worked for the Baby Ape-- and decided to try a lvl 60ish mage I had on Proudmoore. Whaddya know, success. Caught it snowing a few hours later and the Arctic Fox Kits were everywhere. Even had plenty of time and opportunity to find a blue.<br /><br />So it seems if they're going to be there, they won't be hard to find. If you're having trouble finding them in the first 5-10 minutes and it's snowing, just give up and try a different toon, don't waste time flying to all the spawn points.</div>

Then babysat a second one while a guildie got up to Northrend to capture his.

There's usually an <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=62864/arctic-fox-kit">Arctic Fox Kit</a> right by the K3 flight point as well. They appear to share the same spawn locations as <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=62693/arctic-hare">Arctic Hare</a>, so kill these to force more spawns.<br /><br />So far, Battle for Azeroth's timeline seems to be the most reliable for Snowing weather. <br /><br />Note: These pets can't be caged, so you'll have to catch it personally.</div>
