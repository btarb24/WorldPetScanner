Higher health critters are [i]generally [\/i] better quality: 140 health for instance on a alpine hare might be \"poor\" quality, but 150 could be \"rare\".   This is by no means a hard-fast rule; the stats on pets are balanced like they are on gear, if you get a bit more on one stat, you lose on another.  Because of how stats are balanced, you may get a harvester with 270 health that is \"common\" but has low combat abilities, and another that has only 250 health, but is powerful, and fast. judging by its health alone can help decide to continue the fight or just put it out of its misery, but be warned you may kill a rare, based off merely its health.  Only by capturing it and checking stats can you be sure. \n\nOne other thing to note... when capturing wild beasties for your collection, you may only collect up to a total of 3 of any certain type (although bliz did allow more than this for the multiples from many characters, you cannot collect more beyond the limit of 3) so, make sure you have less than 2 when you challenge that hard to find beast\n\nI tame lots of wild beasties for my collection, and prefer only the rare ones for my stables.  I keep a high level pet in my stable of 3 when I go hunting, and if I see that the quarry I'm trying to tame is lower health than the one I just tamed (for the same level of course) I just break out the big gun and put the smack down on it to save time (and win, allowing me to get those consecutive victory achievements at the same time)\n\nOne other thing to consider is that usually in zones beyond the newbie zones a critter you challenge will very likely get a friend to help.. and if the first critter is obviously not the quality you want, just nuke it and move on to his friend.  its not hard and fast, but I've noticed that the 2nd critter is often \"uncommon\" or better in quality, so make your decision to capture the first or second creature quickly, because once you've captured the first one, you cannot capture his \"friend\" as well.","date":"2012-09-27T13:22:43-05:00","rating":4,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":1,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"For clarification, the quality of pets can be determined after you engage.

Can't say for sure yet seeing the wild pet tracker doesn't work.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Samaramon1</b></h3>This will probably be the first rare battle pet you will encounter that you can capture. I saw it wandering around Elwynn (seen quite a few) and I thought the name stuck out from the other sheep-critters, so I attempted to capture it. It worked, and I got the rare pet achievement.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />I wrote this when Pet battles were early in the beta and I had no idea each pet had a rare version, so feel free to ignore this :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>elstohn</b></h3>The &quot;quality&quot; of pets can NOT be determined by the stats before you initiate combat, but it may be <i>guessed </i> when looking at its stats after you have challenged the critter. Higher health critters are <i>generally </i> better quality: 140 health for instance on a alpine hare might be &quot;poor&quot; quality, but 150 could be &quot;rare&quot;. This is by no means a hard-fast rule; the stats on pets are balanced like they are on gear, if you get a bit more on one stat, you lose on another. Because of how stats are balanced, you may get a harvester with 270 health that is &quot;common&quot; but has low combat abilities, and another that has only 250 health, but is powerful, and fast. judging by its health alone can help decide to continue the fight or just put it out of its misery, but be warned you may kill a rare, based off merely its health. Only by capturing it and checking stats can you be sure. <br /><br />One other thing to note... when capturing wild beasties for your collection, you may only collect up to a total of 3 of any certain type (although bliz did allow more than this for the multiples from many characters, you cannot collect more beyond the limit of 3) so, make sure you have less than 2 when you challenge that hard to find beast<br /><br />I tame lots of wild beasties for my collection, and prefer only the rare ones for my stables. I keep a high level pet in my stable of 3 when I go hunting, and if I see that the quarry I'm trying to tame is lower health than the one I just tamed (for the same level of course) I just break out the big gun and put the smack down on it to save time (and win, allowing me to get those consecutive victory achievements at the same time)<br /><br />One other thing to consider is that usually in zones beyond the newbie zones a critter you challenge will very likely get a friend to help.. and if the first critter is obviously not the quality you want, just nuke it and move on to his friend. its not hard and fast, but I've noticed that the 2nd critter is often &quot;uncommon&quot; or better in quality, so make your decision to capture the first or second creature quickly, because once you've captured the first one, you cannot capture his &quot;friend&quot; as well.</div>

You just have to be careful not to be <i>too</i> low, since it takes two rounds to wind up. Chew has since been nerfed, but it still puts out a more damage than you'd expect from a sheep! I was going to level my <a href="/npc=33200/elwynn-lamb">Elwynn Lamb</a>, which has identical abilities, but it's only available in Uncommon and <a href="http://www.warcraftpets.com/wow-pet-battles/breeds/">Breed</a> #3 (B/B).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MRTF</b></h3>Would be interesting to have multiple Elwynn Lambs and 1 Black sheep for RP. The black sheep of the family... Good way to start the drama!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hildur</b></h3>This will have a wonderful updated model in Legion, click view in 3D to se its awesomeness.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Diphenamine</b></h3>Surprisingly great pet vs. undead enemies. <a href="/pet-ability=541/chew">Chew</a> is cast at the very end of the second round, after your second ability, meaning it benefits from <a href="/pet-ability=163/stampede">Stampede</a>s double damage debuff. A H/P breed black lamb has 289 power, so Chew alone deals 1158 damage to undeads in that case.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mike21daisu</b></h3>I farmed this pet for hours, I was looking for a P/S breed but it just didn't happen, it does show that the pet can have a P/S breed but it just didn't happen, I couldn't find a P/S breed for the life of me, doesn't seem like such a breed exists even tho it says it does. Also haven't found a H/P breed either. I probably killed about 100-200 Black Lambs but still haven't found either of these breeds.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Diolur</b></h3>Is it active only in certain hours? Couldn't find it anywhere...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>hatdort</b></h3>as of 2/10/2024 I am having issues finding this pet anywhere in the Elwynn Forest</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>UnloosedDisc</b></h3>&quot;There appears to be an issue with this wild pet's spawn during the revamped <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/event=423/love-is-in-the-air">Love is in the Air</a> holiday, likely linked to the zone-wide decorations.&quot; <a href="https://www.wow-petguide.com/Pet/60649/Black_Lamb" rel="nofollow"></a><br /><br />Update: As predicted with the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/event=423/love-is-in-the-air">Love is in the Air</a> event over I was able to get all three of my desired <a href="/npc=60649/black-lamb">Black Lamb</a> breeds within 15 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gelebor</b></h3>I have been farming the fawns / rabbits infront of the Stormwind Gates, out of the 2000 pet battles I've done there, 2 spawns have been black lambs.</div>
