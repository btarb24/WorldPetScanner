Could someone clarify please if it's possible to loot the pet with trial characters? Thanks in advance!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wyckd</b></h3>I thought I could force spawn Demidos by doing the Assault on Socrethar. But, nope. I purchased the missive from garrison quartermaster, and completed the assault with no requirements/objective to kill Demidos. <br /><br />Unforunately, I'll just have to sit and wait. BUT! I won't, because that's an epic waste of my time personally and I'll just buy the damn pet from AH. <br /><br />At the time of this post, 12k on Stormrage Alliance. 15k on Area-52 Horde (the cost of the pet).</div>
