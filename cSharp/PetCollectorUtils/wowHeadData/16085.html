It is unfortunately limited to [petability=238] damage, providing poor type coverage, but excelling at slaying [petability=245]. Probably his favorite past-time, during the off-season.\n\nHis abilities allow for several combinations:\n[b]1st slot: [petability=771]\/[petability=774][\/b]\nGiven this slot has no cooldown, it'll provide your basic spammable ability (sort of defining your pet's role) either in the shape of AoE or single-target damage. Worth mentioning, [b]Rapid Fire[\/b] splits its damage in 2 hits, being very effective under [petability=203], but completely useless during a [petability=454].\n\n[b]2nd slot: [petability=772]\/[petability=775][\/b]\nYour CC slot. [b]Lovestruck[\/b] will often be the preferred choice due to reliability, while [b]Perfumed Arrow[\/b] is probably more useful as a means of single-target damage if you are running [b]Rapid Fire[\/b] on your first slot.\n\n[b]3rd slot: [petability=773]\/[petability=776][\/b]\nAs tempting as it looks, and as glorious as 1-shotting Dragons can be... [b]Shot through the Heart[\/b] isn't that great, as it's predictable and has a cooldown - although it is better than 2x[b]Bow Shot[\/b]. Works well along with Lovestruck, and also as a single-target alternative if running [b]Rapid Fire[\/b]. [b]Love Potion[\/b] is more universal, and can keep your pet alive even if he's slower than the opponent.\n\nWith that in mind, some good builds are:\n[small][petability=771]+[petability=772]+[petability=776] Basic, durable single target\/control build.\n[petability=774]+[petability=772]+[petability=776] AoE build, winning time with heals and stuns to slowly wither the enemy; but very weak against sandstorms.\n[petability=774]+[petability=775]+[petability=776] Another AoE alternative, uses Perfumed Arrow for single-target damage and maybe a stun.\n[petability=774]+[petability=772]+[petability=773] Main filler will be AoE, being able to use Lovestruck>Shot for single-target, or to force swaps.[\/small]\n\nOn the other side of the ring, we have the not-so-good builds:\n[small][petability=771]+[petability=775]+[petability=773] Redundant, almost the same ability on all slots, no means of CC or durability.\n[petability=774]+[petability=775]+[petability=773] All-out build with both single-target and area damage. Sacrifices much, so better to focus on a single role.[\/small]\n\nAll in all, this guy's a hidden gem that I'm glad to have discovered.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Urban</b></h3>For Horde I found him in Thrall's Chamber.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wildhorn</b></h3>There is 1 of them in all City Leader's Room. Depending in which city you turn it in, it will give a vote to that leader.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>greengoo</b></h3>This pet can be used to cause an earthquake to anyone in your vicinity. When you summon him, it makes the ground around you rumble visibly. Because it is instant cast, and has no CD, by spamming it everyone around you experiences the effect.<br /><br />So get one, run around spamming it, and cause earthquakes wherever you go :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>56415</b></h3>Somehow i just got this pet and i have no idea. Perhaps it if a gift from someone or a buff or something, but all of a sudden i have this ugly minion folllowing me around, which is morbidly amusing</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>112893</b></h3>This pet is bestowed upon you when someone shoots you with silver shafted arrows. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22200">Wowhead!</a> It is only temporary. To get the permanent summonable pet which is Kwee Q. Peddlefeet, you need True silver shafted arrows <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22235">Wowhead!</a>, this pet is a reward given out during the valentines celebration. It is contained in Gift and Pledges of adoration and is somewhat rare.<br /><br />Dendylbar</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Deckard</b></h3>If you're tired of Peddlefeet and want him quit following you around, just summon another non-combat pet. That will get rid of the little bastard.<br /><br />Similarly, if you want to keep from getting him in first place, keep a pet out, especially in the highly populated cities.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dhazy</b></h3><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=35223">Papa Hummel's Old-Fashioned Pet Biscuit</a> makes this guy almost as big as the real Valentine's Day one. Kind of scary, actually.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>936694</b></h3>I just got him while I was in the middle of playing one of the games at the Darkmoon Faire, which was weird because I was saying to myself &quot;would someone move your damn flying goblin out of my way&quot;! Then when I was done with the game, I walked away and noticed that thing following me, lol! Not sure why I got him or what I need him for (I already have a pet). But I guess it's cool.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>regma</b></h3>Wonder if he'll ever get a new model. I think he's the only one with the older goblin model.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>752995</b></h3>In Battle Pets this guy owns Dragonkin. Many players will be running one or more Dragons (for example the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=36607">Onyxian Whelpling</a> - a powerful little fighter with a strong self heal). Peddlefeet can almost completely shut down and nuke a Dragonkin. Also, he is fast, so he usually goes first.<br /><br />For anything besides a Beast class pet he's is still a decent fighter due to his speed and handy stun.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>catadon22</b></h3>he is very effective in pet battles with his love struck+ shot through the heart.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>r4z0r84</b></h3>most over powered pet in the game currently, requires no skill and can closely one shot any pet. i sense nerf inc</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Golgoth</b></h3>While Goblins tend to favor massive guns and explosives, this little guy is quite remarkable with a bow!<br /><br />Peddlefeet has a flexible skillset, with both single target and AoE, plus healing and Crowd-control. It is unfortunately limited to <a href="/pet-ability=238/humanoid">Humanoid</a> damage, providing poor type coverage, but excelling at slaying <a href="/pet-ability=245/dragonkin">Dragonkin</a>. Probably his favorite past-time, during the off-season.<br /><br />His abilities allow for several combinations:<br /><b>1st slot: <a href="/pet-ability=771/bow-shot">Bow Shot</a>/<a href="/pet-ability=774/rapid-fire">Rapid Fire</a></b><br />Given this slot has no cooldown, it'll provide your basic spammable ability (sort of defining your pet's role) either in the shape of AoE or single-target damage. Worth mentioning, <b>Rapid Fire</b> splits its damage in 2 hits, being very effective under <a href="/pet-ability=203/lightning-storm">Lightning Storm</a>, but completely useless during a <a href="/pet-ability=454/sandstorm">Sandstorm</a>.<br /><br /><b>2nd slot: <a href="/pet-ability=772/lovestruck">Lovestruck</a>/<a href="/pet-ability=775/perfumed-arrow">Perfumed Arrow</a></b><br />Your CC slot. <b>Lovestruck</b> will often be the preferred choice due to reliability, while <b>Perfumed Arrow</b> is probably more useful as a means of single-target damage if you are running <b>Rapid Fire</b> on your first slot.<br /><br /><b>3rd slot: <a href="/pet-ability=773/shot-through-the-heart">Shot Through The Heart</a>/<a href="/pet-ability=776/love-potion">Love Potion</a></b><br />As tempting as it looks, and as glorious as 1-shotting Dragons can be... <b>Shot through the Heart</b> isn't that great, as it's predictable and has a cooldown - although it is better than 2x<b>Bow Shot</b>. Works well along with Lovestruck, and also as a single-target alternative if running <b>Rapid Fire</b>. <b>Love Potion</b> is more universal, and can keep your pet alive even if he's slower than the opponent.<br /><br />With that in mind, some good builds are:<br /><a href="/pet-ability=771/bow-shot">Bow Shot</a>+<a href="/pet-ability=772/lovestruck">Lovestruck</a>+<a href="/pet-ability=776/love-potion">Love Potion</a> Basic, durable single target/control build.<br /><a href="/pet-ability=774/rapid-fire">Rapid Fire</a>+<a href="/pet-ability=772/lovestruck">Lovestruck</a>+<a href="/pet-ability=776/love-potion">Love Potion</a> AoE build, winning time with heals and stuns to slowly wither the enemy; but very weak against sandstorms.<br /><a href="/pet-ability=774/rapid-fire">Rapid Fire</a>+<a href="/pet-ability=775/perfumed-arrow">Perfumed Arrow</a>+<a href="/pet-ability=776/love-potion">Love Potion</a> Another AoE alternative, uses Perfumed Arrow for single-target damage and maybe a stun.<br /><a href="/pet-ability=774/rapid-fire">Rapid Fire</a>+<a href="/pet-ability=772/lovestruck">Lovestruck</a>+<a href="/pet-ability=773/shot-through-the-heart">Shot Through The Heart</a> Main filler will be AoE, being able to use Lovestruck&gt;Shot for single-target, or to force swaps.<br /><br />On the other side of the ring, we have the not-so-good builds:<br /><a href="/pet-ability=771/bow-shot">Bow Shot</a>+<a href="/pet-ability=775/perfumed-arrow">Perfumed Arrow</a>+<a href="/pet-ability=773/shot-through-the-heart">Shot Through The Heart</a> Redundant, almost the same ability on all slots, no means of CC or durability.<br /><a href="/pet-ability=774/rapid-fire">Rapid Fire</a>+<a href="/pet-ability=775/perfumed-arrow">Perfumed Arrow</a>+<a href="/pet-ability=773/shot-through-the-heart">Shot Through The Heart</a> All-out build with both single-target and area damage. Sacrifices much, so better to focus on a single role.<br /><br />All in all, this guy's a hidden gem that I'm glad to have discovered. It's easy to <i>fall in love</i> with him!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mistmare</b></h3>Legion update - Sunborn Val'kyr is p much identical ability-wise and available year-round from the Stormheim (Broken Isles) faction vendor.</div>
