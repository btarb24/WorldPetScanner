These only spawn at night and share the same spawn points with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=98385/erudite-manafiend">Eurdite Manafiends</a> which spawn during the day.<br /><br />Edit:<br />1. They are fixed and tameable now.<br />2. Per Blizzard Daytime is 6:30AM to 8:30PM server time. <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/877604247809867777" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/i/web/status/877604247809867777</a>(##RESPBREAK##)6152##DELIM##CalaelenDT##DELIM##</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mzbehavin</b></h3>you can only find these puppies well manafiends at night time and the erudite during the daytime</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>Interestingly enough, although the icon on these is bright orange, they are a dark and shadowy grey, while their daytime counterpart, the <a href="/npc=98385/erudite-manafiend">Erudite Manafiend</a>, has a dark grey icon and yet are bright and shining silver-grey. One almost wonders if they got reversed in the NPC creation.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tyuriwen</b></h3>Found 3 of these little ones in the same vicinity, Ley-Ruins of Zarkhenar in Azsuna :)<br /><br />Much like the case with the Northern Hawk Owl, all of the ones I encountered were P/S and of a rare quality. Obviously not a big enough sample size to make a noteworthy observation, but if anyone encounters a different rarity/breed I'd love to know :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AllureMG</b></h3>It's 8:30 p.m. server time on Staghelm and only the Erudite's are spawning. So, either &quot;night&quot; comes later or the info about day/night spawns is incorrect. I'll edit if anything changes. (This is the last pet I need for the Broken Isles Safari achieve and I'm getting impatient! Lol)<br />**erm, yeah it spawned as soon as i posted my comment so maybe 8:30 is the magic time! Good luck all!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cantralian</b></h3>There's a reliable spawn point (for both Erudite and Eldritch) near 55.91 13.79, in the Ley-Ruins of Zarkhenar. It's right under one of those towers that pumps out the energy drain, but if you grab some fighter chow you won't have any issues, because the drain doesn't count as being in combat and you can start the battle, no worries (your character is going to look very odd, though!). Every one I've seen here of both pets has been a blue, so hopefully you'll have the same luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pich</b></h3>I've been to Ley-Ruins of Zarkhenar multiple times during the day killing all of the erudies I see hoping I'll get an eldritch to spawn for 2 days already and no luck.It's not daytime related.Seems to be a very rare spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>survik1</b></h3>There are 3 spawn areas for this pet. 57-13 under the platform, 55-17 around <a href="/npc=90389/ishkaneth">Ishkaneth</a> and 3rd is in small crater at 58.8-17.3. There is always at least one pet (with about 30 sec tolerance) but maximum I've seen was 3 at once. They do not spawn inside the big crater in the middle of ruins so no need to come down.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vjorlana</b></h3>Based on the other comments, the window is at least from 8:30 PM to 4 AM server time, maybe longer. I caught one at 4 AM exactly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Atraira</b></h3>Just caught one at 8:50 PM server/EST.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1699865</b></h3>I just caught one (rare quality, too!) at about 3:25am PST. Realm time (Kil'jaeden) is about two minutes fast by my clock. YMMV.<br /><br />This was a <i>far</i> swifter catch than that rotten kingfeather. I just showed up at these ruins, and there was my pet. I see one more manafiend pet inside a building, but caught mine outside it, at coordinates 56.83, 11.13. Exploring a bit showed that there were at least two more in the ruins.<br /><br />I strongly recommend using NPCScan or Silver Dragon to find these more easily.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rygaux</b></h3>Caught a rare one at 7:57 AM server time. (Eastern Standard Time)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tyranea</b></h3>I'm on an Oceanic realm and I had been stuck on the quest <a href="/quest=44996/hunting-lesson-erudite-manafiend">Hunting Lesson: Erudite Manafiend</a> for several days. I went to the area many times, at all times of the day and night, and I only ever saw Eldritch Manafiends up. I tried realm hopping, battling all pets in the area, killing all pet in the area with a /tar macro, waiting for respawns, and I only ever saw Eldritch Manafiends. I submitted a ticket yesterday about it, wrote in detail everything i'd tried and I mentioned that others on Oceanic realms have had problems with this quest also. I received a standard &quot;cut and paste&quot; response so I ignored that and decided to go back to the area for another look. I arrived at 11.59am realm time (Sydney) and THEY WERE UP! I was so excited that I raced over the the closest one and of course agroed a few mobs which I had to kill before I could start the pet battle. I'm a priest and I used Psychic Scream to avoid taking some damage and it feared the pet as well, which put it in combat and then my champion killed it! (Don't worry, some strong words were had). I stayed in the area for a while to finish this quest, try to find a rare (which I didn't) and do a world quest. <b>They respawned as Erudite Manafiends until 12.30pm realm time (Sydney). At 12.31pm I saw an Eldritch Manafiend up and left the area.</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thedd</b></h3>According to this page, the only possible breed for this pet is H/S, and that is not true... I caught a P/S. Just in case anyone was wondering.</div>
