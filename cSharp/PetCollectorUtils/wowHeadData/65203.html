So After reading the comments about it showing up in other paw pet battles I started battling rapana whelks near the map location. After 2 rapana whelk battles an Emperor Crab paw spawned. I battled it...grey. So I battled another 2 rapana whelks and another Emperor Crab spawned...For an entire hour I kept doing this (terrible luck on rare emperor crab). I traveled all over the briny muck area. Emperor Crabs Spawned ALL OVER the briny muck location after Rapana Whelk battles. It was not limited to that one location. For me and for a few guild members I told...battling rapana whelks paws seemed to trigger the emperor crab spawns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>spiralofhope</b></h3>The best crab ever.<br /><br />Also seems to only come as a Power/Power. Remember that power also influences healing.<br /><br />So while this won't have a lot of health, and will have an abysmal speed.. shell shield makes it very hard to hurt, and it can heal itself about 1/3 its health, with a short cooldown.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kokbre</b></h3>Emperor Crab can be found any Mixed Pet Better round The Briny Muck i found mine from first better and Rare one...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1009411</b></h3>I've leveled this guy up to 25 and while I love him for the great stats and the fighting he's able to do. I've noticed that the tooltip for his surge ability says &quot;this move always goes first&quot; but this has failed to happen in the last several battles that I've done with him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Daherado</b></h3>Can come in 2 different breeds, one P/P and the other H/H, the stats at lvl 25 look like this<br /><br />P/P 1481HP - 358 Pwr - 211 Spd<br />H/H 1806HP - 293 Pwr - 211 Spd<br /><br />Either breed is pretty good, the health one being able to take lots of dmg and still put out a decent amount, whereas the Power one is phenomenally strong and can heal large amounts too, also having an average health pool.<br /><br />Overall a very strong pet, definately one to have in your line-up, i use this with fantastic results on the pandaren spirit tamer dailies. =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SimpsonsRule</b></h3>If you're looking for a rare version of this pet, I <i>highly</i> recommend farming the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=64352">Rapana Whelk</a> around The Briny Muck (37, 61) for the following reasons:<br /><br /><ol><li>There are occasional Emperor Crab spawns around The Briny Muck.</li><li>Emperor Crabs can appear as secondary pets all over Dread Wastes, so you will frequently encounter them while fighting Rapana Whelk.</li><li>The Briny Muck has a relatively low density of hostile mobs so you won't be slowed down killing things while searching.</li><li>The Rapana Whelk respawn faster than you can battle them.</li></ol><br /><br />The Emperor Crab was the last rare I needed for the zone, but I wish I had farmed the Rapana Whelk straight off the bat. I encountered a rare of every other pet which can appear as a secondary before grabbing my Emperor Crab. If your luck is as <s>good</s> bad as mine, you should consider giving it a shot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1109641</b></h3>This is by far the best aquatic pet in my collection so far. My rare at level 25 has a power of 357, which combined with an ability to always go first and a self heal with a decent CD makes him pretty much indestructible, even against some flying battle pets I've encountered. I highly recommend seeking this one out. He's well worth it.<br /><br /><u>Rare at level 25</u><br />Health: 1481<br />Power: 357<br />Speed: 211</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Draewind</b></h3>This is one of my favorites. He can solo Lucky Yi. He is a must for your battle team (P/P), does incredible damage to anything critter. The Emperor Crab and Kun Lai Runt are absolute destroyers of anything critter, and can both solo Lucky Yi (the legendary critter Lucky Yi in the Beasts of Fable quest). Get the P/P breed and use a stone to make him rare quality ... well worth it. At 25 he has a heal and other attacks that expand his abilities to epic proportions as pets go. Hardy, versatile, and destructive. Can you tell he is one of my favorites, and one that I use as the backbone to level up two little ones at a time.<br /><br />When running the Battle Pet Tamer dailies, the Emperor Crab is what I use against all elementals (Kun Lai Runt takes the critters). His main attack always triggers first, he heals, and has a delayed big punch (for a one two combo dealing about 1000 damage together). I have had crits in excess of 1000 for all spells against elementals.<br /><br />To get them, farm the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=64352">Rapana Whelk</a>. This guy is a an additional enemy that joins the fight. I have never seen a rare in the wild, so get a P/P breed and use a stone. You may also desire a Rapana Whelk for your team when doing Tamer Dailies. Until I realized that one dive miss with the Rapana will result in a wipe against the Thundering Pandaren Spirit when using Rapana against the Pandaren Earth Spirit ... I had to find an answer ... enter the Emperor Crab hitting first and hitting hard. Funny that I got him while getting the Rapana for that fight. I have two of them at 25. I used the level 23 as the main for one round of dailies, and after two fights as the only survivor ... he was 25.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>strataa</b></h3>I found one at 43,60 in Dread Wastes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1114434</b></h3>Easily found in any battle as a 2nd or 3rd pet</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>motafina</b></h3>They are scattered around the Briny Muck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TevishSzat</b></h3>Named: Insolence (After a comment by the Locust)<br /><br />The power-focused breed is actually quite frightening -- 358 competes with some of the strongest pets out there, letting it do respectable damage while using its tanking moves heavily. Of course, the health breed gives you more leeway regarding shell shield/renewing mist/healing wave rotation, but power should also increase the ability of the pet to heal and prevent damage, so I'm not sure the extra 400hp would be worthwhile.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>CircleofHealing</b></h3>This pet is frustrating to opponents in PvP with a breed 14 (P/P) version. It is a real war of attrition. <br /><br />A level 25 Emperor Crab is <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/petability=356">Snapping</a> for 350, healing with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=511">Renewing Mists</a> for 140 and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=310">Shell Shielding</a> 95. Net damage and healing per turn is around <b>595</b> with no cooldowns.<br /><br />Alternatively you can have another aquatic such as a Mirror strider setting up Cleansing Rain and still hit for 350.use the faster <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=509">Surge</a>. <br /><br />Keep the Healing Mists and Shield up and chip away and chip away and chip away.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1119572</b></h3>Found one at 62/80. Make the macro and spam it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>GoRozZo</b></h3>Actually, this pet can win solo 1x3 in pvp of three 25 lvls. <a href="/npc=62555/flayer-youngling">Flayer Youngling</a> and <a href="/npc=68659/anubisath-idol">Anubisath Idol</a> also can do it solo tbh. If you interesting you can watch my video where i showed 1x3 win by one pet.<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYEDpfrAcSQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYEDpfrAcSQ</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Timmy93</b></h3>So I decided to start doing my Pandaria Safari achievement.. Came across a rare Emperor Crab as secondary. Decided to catch it for my rare collection and it ended up being a P/P Breed.<br /><br />I've just started using it and I LOVE it.. Really tank and does nice damage. I just use it to solo pretty much everything while I level it up.<br /><br />For people that are farming for it, it's a really nice pet to add to your team and don't give up!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>503532</b></h3>Here's my pro tip.<br /><br />Go to the ledge where <a href="/npc=68558/gorespine">Gorespine</a> isâ€”he's one of the elite battle-pets for the &quot;Beasts of Fable&quot; achievement. There are about seven Silent Hedgehogs around Gorespine. The Emperor Crab will appear as a secondary.<br /><br />If you are leveling other battle-pets, this is a good place to do it. . .<br /><br />Check all of the Hedgehods but two. Kill the ones that don't have your Emperor. Then pull out your leveling team (assuming you have the <i><u>Battle Pet Teams</u></i> add-on). Fight the remaining two Hedgehogs. By the time you're done with the 2nd battle, more Hedgehogs will have spawned.<br /><br />Rince and repeat.<br /><br />You can stand in one spot, without moving, and reach all the Hedgehogs on the shelf, and they will just continue to re-spawn indefinitely. I've gotten both my P/P Emperor Crabs this way. I have two of all my power-players for the tournament, so I can have my best even if one dies.<br /><br />To add, I got rares of almost all the other pets in the zone (as secondaries) standing in this spot fighting Silent Hedgehogs.<br /><br />Hope this helps. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>WoWPlayer16</b></h3>I found several more in different locations. These seem like they spawn infrequently and possibly where rapana welks sometimes also spawn. But here are some of the other coordinates for primary battles. (One note, though, these can often be found battling any other pet battle in the Dread Wastes)<br /><br />29.7 -- 64.0<br />32.6 -- 61.9<br />37.1 -- 62.9<br />38.7 -- 61.9<br />40.5 -- 59.1<br />41.2 -- 70.0<br />43.3 -- 59.7<br />44.5 -- 62.3<br /><br />If I see any others I'll try to remember to an update here with additional coordinates.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>esztii</b></h3>Found one at 35,68.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zharshoul</b></h3>This p/p crab is still op as the day I caught him back in pandaria and has still managed to avoid being nerfed.<br /><br />I can regularly have him solo people in pvp and just about everything in pve.<br /><br />The combination of renewing mists and shell shield backed by a very high base line attack stat+p/p breed means generally only combo shenanigans or single target flying moves will be able to break through his defenses.<br /><br />Basically if he isn't getting hit by attacks that remove like 40% of his hp per turn at least.. he is almost always going to win.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Chainrattle</b></h3>Contrary to the map above, this little guy spawns at 41.17, 69.90 in Dread Wastes as well</div>
