I'd say you want at least one of the aquatic moves unless, you know, taking on a critter species beast of fable or something like that.

An its a Godzilla based monster! Kinda wish it was the same color as Gahz'rilla but oh well this is gona be sweet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>anonymousSnowman</b></h3>He's a reference to the Godzilla cartoon from 1978 in which Godzilla has a nephew named Godzooky who is the comic relief character.<br /><br />I have never thought in my life that this knowledge would be useful. I'm so glad I watched this as a child now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>coolfreezer</b></h3>I would say this pet is more a reference to <a href="/npc=15114/gahzranka">Gahz'ranka</a> and the &quot;rooki&quot; meaning rookie as he has to learn much to become like is &quot;bigger&quot; self</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Harrilal</b></h3>Interesting that the hydra in Underbog, Outland has the same naming convention as 3 other hydra in Azeroth.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=7273">Gahz'rilla</a> , <a href="http://old.wowhead.com/npc=15114">Gahz'ranka</a> and <a href="http://ptr.wowhead.com/npc=71159">Gahz'rooki</a> all share the same naming convention with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=18105">Ghaz'an</a>. The 'H' has a different placement, but they would still all sound very very similar.<br /><br />Perhaps the connection between Outland and Azeroth via the Old Gods is indeed a viable theory. Or perhaps the Naga and Blood Elves brought it over with them?<br /><br />Both theories are merely speculation at the moment. It is just food for thought for the lore-hounds.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DrCheis</b></h3>I'm curious if this pet will still be available in patch 5.4, or if it's limited to 5.3. For now we'll have to wait to find out...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lokuv</b></h3>To those who have gotten the pet already: can he be caged/sold on the AH?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TevishSzat</b></h3>What you get for that Radical Mojo<br /><br />1) Gahz'rooki exists in only one breed: Power/Speed. His final stats are 1400/297/281: his health is meager but his other stats are... respectable. Not the best, by any means, but at least in PvP Pet battles he'll do ok damage and have a decent chance of going first<br /><br />2) Gahz'rooki has a rather interesting moveset that mixes beast and aquatic moves, and a single elemental attack thrown in for giggles.<br /><br />Strategy-wise, I think most of Gahz'rooki's moves are matters of personal preference: Tail slap does about 20% more damage than bite for about 20% less hitting, while Swallow You Whole and Devour both care about enemies on low hp. I'd say you want at least one of the aquatic moves unless, you know, taking on a critter species beast of fable or something like that. Between Whirlpool and Geyser, though, Geyser seems the clear choice: it has a longer CD and duration, but slightly better damage and the all-important round of stun.<br /><br />3) Gahz'rooki is a pet hydra. Be the envy of Hunters everywhere!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>filletr0n</b></h3>I think his ability &quot;Swallow You Whole&quot; is a reference to a line from the movie Jaws, delivered by the late great Robert Shaw as Captain Quint.<br /><br />Quint: This shark, swallow you whole. - Taken from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/quotes" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/quotes</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mistmare</b></h3>Summoning stone still drops in Dragonflight - but only by Crossroads locations not NW listed . Got it after about 3 hours of farming off of a Kokron Butcher. You should be getting windwool off the common drop not linen and wool. If you get linen and wool you're in the wrong area.</div>
