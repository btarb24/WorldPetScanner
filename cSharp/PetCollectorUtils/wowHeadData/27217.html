The Gold Medallion in fact summons (<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48406">spell</a>) a mini-pet called the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=27217">Spirit of Competition</a> (<a href="http://i36.tinypic.com/97mlmw.jpg" rel="nofollow">picture</a>) in the form of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_dragon" rel="nofollow">Chinese dragon</a>.<br /><br />By participating in a battleground game on any battleground, on any level, you would, during that time, always receive a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=36941">Competitor's Tabard</a>, whether you won or lost.<br /><br />You can find more information about the <a href="http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/events/spiritofcompetition/" rel="nofollow"><s>Spirit of Competition event</s></a> (deprecated url) on the European World of Warcraft info pages.<br /><br />Talking to a commoner during the Olympics in any of the capital cities gave you further information on how to gain these items.<br /><br /><div class="quote-box">Every two years the Spirits of Competition grow especially fervent... and now is that time! We wear this tabard into the Battlegrounds to honor them, seeking to defeat our enemies and earn their favor.<br /><br /><b>Q: How do I earn a Competitor's Tabard?</b><br />A: You need only face our rivals in any of the Battlegrounds. Win or lose, if you stay for the duration of the battle, you will be mailed a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=36941">Competitor's Tabard</a>.<br /><br /><b>Q: How can I gain the favor of a Spirit of Competition?</b><br />A: You must defeat our rivals in any of the Battlegrounds. With every victory, there is a chance that a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=37297">Gold Medallion</a> will be mailed to you.<br /></div><br /><br />You got an in-game mail when you received one of these prizes.<br /><br /><div class="quote-box"><b>Competitor's Tabard</b><br />You fought bravely in a battleground and impressed the Spirits of Competition... Well done! As a reward, you have been gifted with this mark of favor; a Competitor's Tabard. Wear it proudly.<br /><br /><b>Gold Medallion</b><br />You have honored the Spirits of Competition with your fervor in the face of the enemy. Congratulations! With this Gold Medallion, they will be proud to be seen at your side.<br /></div><br /><br />There is also a different version of the dragon mini-pet, called the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=27346">Essence of Competition</a>. You can summon (<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48408">spell</a>) it by using an item called the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=37298">Competitor's Souvenir</a>, which you were able to get by talking to the Battleground Enthusiast in either Ironforge or Orgrimmar, and giving her a secret code.<br /><br />The Battleground Enthusiast in Ironforge was a female dwarf called <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=27398">Gilbarta Grandhammer</a>, and she was located in the Hall of Arms in the Military Ward. The Battleground Enthusiast in Orgrimmar was a female orc called <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=27399">Muja</a>, and she was located in the Hall of the Brave in the Valley of Honor.<br /><br /><div class="quote-box">You know the Spirits of Competition, yes?<br /><br />Every two years they draw close to the mortal realm. During such times, members of both the Alliance and Horde wear Competitor's Tabards into the Battlegrounds to honor the spirits, seeking to defeat one another and earn their favor.<br /><br />I stockpile souvenirs from such turbulent times. If you've learned the proper word, I might be convinced to part with one...<br /><br /><ul><li><b>I would like to enter the secret code to receive my Competitor's Souvenir.</b></li></ul><br /></div><br /><br />While the Essence of Competition could be found next to the Battleground Enthusiasts, it was never released in Europe or the US as a mini-pet for players.

The NPCs found on those servers to redeem the code are a bug.<br /><br />Throughout each day of the event in China, the code is mailed to 500 random players. Only players who have achieved various in-game milestones during the event are eligible for a chance to receive the code. Some milestones include having an Arena rating of 1650+, increasing reputation for certain Outland factions from less than revered to exalted, or raising a crafting profession from 350 or less to 375.</div><br /><br /><u><b>Hints:</b></u><br /><ul><li>Any battleground which you participate in, whether won or lost, will award you with the tabard.</li><li>Any battleground which you won may award you with the gold medallion.</li><li>You don't need to win 3 (or more) games in a row to get the gold medallion.</li><li>You don't need to be #1 in kills or healing etc. to get the gold medallion.</li><li>You don't need to be wearing the tabard to get the gold medallion.</li><li>The mini-pet seems to be of the same level as the player who acquired it.</li></ul></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Santykins</b></h3>Thanks for the info K21Nova,<br /> There are only two things that I am not sure of. <br /><br /><ol><li> How high is the &quot;Drop-Rate&quot; on the Gold Medallion? </li></ol><br /><br />Furthermore<div class="quote-box">The mini-pet seems to be of the same level as the player who acquired it.</div><br />Is a correct observation and, like most Holiday non-combat pets the Essence of Competition tracks the player's level from 1-70.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>59676</b></h3>Last night I went through 17 BG's, varying among EotS, AV, AB and WG. I won 8 of them. I did not get the pet. I got the tabard first shot. Two of the people I know got the pet on the first win. Two people got it 2nd win. I know of at least 3 people who had to win 4 or 5 times to get the pet.<br /><br />4+ hours of BG's and no pet for me.<br /><br />Sometimes I really hate WoW.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Murrdurr</b></h3>Got gold medal first BG at lvl17 heh, friend said he has gone through about 20 BGs with 7 won and still no gold medal</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>131361</b></h3>its not a chinese dragon it doesn't have 5 claws</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Faeore</b></h3>For comparison sake, at level 25 my pet has the following stats:<br />HP: 1627 Atk: 289 Spd: 244<br />Several others have the same which implies all level 25 of this pet may roll with identical stats due to the unique nature making it impossible to &quot;reroll&quot; a badly-rolled one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>settlestone</b></h3>that really sucks.. so theres no way to ever get one again. that's pretty lame.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Stormeey</b></h3>This post needs a tag saying no longer available :) I did like 50 bg's to finally get this back in the day! I do love that i have a couple things that are no longer available. There are many things i DON'T have i wish i did that are in that category. With the massive collections of things that folks have now it is nice to have SOMETHING truly rare.<br /><br />EDIT: I guess this pet is available through Trading Post which makes me a little sad tbh. I guess the achievement stands so at least there is that</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Solhunt</b></h3>This pet is available through August 2023's Trading Post for 650 Trader's Tender.<br /><br />(See official WoW channel Trading Post trailer for confirmation).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>nevahsaynevah</b></h3>Earned this back in the day and ended up deleting my character I had it on just 6 months before they consolidated all pets to shared status and lost it :( I guess now I will be buying it through Trading Post as I couldn't get my character recovered back then to get my pet back.</div>

    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>
