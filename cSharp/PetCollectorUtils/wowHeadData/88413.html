I went to group finder and started using the Group Finder for those offering their garrison, just like I did for the wasp from Spires. After 5 realm hops, there he was and I started the battle to get his health low enough to cage. I had a Terrible Turnip on the team, but I had not swapped him in yet. <br /><br />Even tho it appeared there was no way my pet could get close to killing it, yup dead as a doornail. I could have cried. What a noob error. I left the group and continued my search. Three realm hops later there it was again. I made sure not to assume anything and I caged a Poor quality, but have plenty of stones to upgrade.<br /><br />My personal opinion, is to find a spot, realm hop and hope for the best. It worked for me with the wasp and the moth.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.warcraftpets.com/collection/Nommis/">http://www.warcraftpets.com/collection/Nommis/</a> in case you are interested in my collection</div>
