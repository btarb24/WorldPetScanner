It's bigger then <a href="/npc=61321/lizard-hatchling">Lizard Hatchling</a> who is also in the pet journal in MoP.<br />Might be one of the new wild pet's that is in the pet journal in MoP. Can't say for sure yet seeing the wild pet tracker doesn't work.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>356640</b></h3>Rares:<br />1094, 199, 199<br />1036, 208, 208<br /><br />Uncommon:<br />1018, 184, 184<br />964, 192, 192<br /><br />Those are the level 18 stats, when you're actually fighting them, before capture weakens them.<br /><br />Spawn rate seems slow. After two passes through the area I would head off to look for the other zone unique pets. By the time I got back there would be some more hatchlings spawned</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JBonezzz</b></h3>So far I have not seen this little guy as an add, only named mob. There seems to be a handful of this type of pet and some are very low and long spawns. I would say this one is not to bad so far as I can tell. Good luck and happy hunting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zeerina</b></h3>Lots of these guys. I have fought several and have not come across a rare as of yet but I have noticed that if you are looking for uncommon the health seems to be around 800. Just caught one health at 803. Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>qaccy</b></h3>Many spawns throughout northern Terokkar, but they seem to have a relatively long respawn. I flew through in the middle of the day and had at least 2 dozen encounters with no rare, but on my second pass there were only squirrels and skunks to be found. Come back later if you can't find any!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jolni</b></h3>This fella is proving to be a (consults list) 'misbegotton wretch' to find rare.<br /><br />What I've seen so far:<br /><br />1, Found in Terokkar only, pretty much all over.<br /><br />2, Is only ever a primary battle, dont bother with other pets as it is never 2nd or 3rd battle pet.<br /><br />3, Although there is generally plenty of these, they have a low spawn rate, so clearing them all in the zone on the quest for a rare can leave them few and far between.<br /><br />I have camped Terokkar on two realms and alternated per clear to give them chance to respawn which works quite well, been at it a couple of hours and still not got one - either RNG is not my friend today or they have quite a low drop rate for rare, greens however seem quite common.<br /><br />I'll update this when I get one...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kamiccolokuetan</b></h3>I found three of these guys randomly and was able to get a rare on the third. It was level 18 with 1094 health.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1076510</b></h3>I got mine in Terokkar Forest. It showed up after I had gotten the other pets that where there gone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>YoshimaraMuse</b></h3>I was flying through Terokkar to pick up the debts for this quest <a href="/quest=10009/crackin-some-skulls">Crackin' Some Skulls</a> and I decided to try my luck in finding the Warpstalker Hatchling. Well, long story short I did and I got a rare on my first try! However, with a few of the different rares I've collected--this one does NOT change colors each time it's summoned (like <a href="/npc=62019/cat">Cat</a> ). <br /><br />Just thought I would let other rare collectors know that while there ARE rares available for this, I think the RNG decided to be nice to me considering I'm being forced to lose sleep and gave this one to me, that he does NOT change colors. <br /><br />Happy Hunting everyone!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1089679</b></h3>This is one of the few pets that seems extremely hard to catch a rare of. I have now fought almost 300 and spend over 3 days hunting. i have not once come across a rare as of yet. Also the re spawn time seems a little longer then most pets seems like i start seeing them respawn about 15-30 min after i kill the last in the zone. any suggestions with this little guys would be great, because im about to the point to buy a 10k flawless battle stone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Znaleziatko</b></h3>I just found my <b>rare</b>. It took me about an hour - I just flew around Terokkar Forest and battled every Warpstalker Hatchling, so I also got couple of my low level pets leveled up this way (2 low level pets and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=40624">Celestial Dragon</a>).<br /><br />So for all of you already losing hope to get this one - they do come in rare quality, keep looking :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Josyx</b></h3>I found mine at the Bonechewer Ruins! the first one i saw was rare, and i got it ^^<br /><br />It was the first one I saw, I flew from Shattrath and then zig zag'ed all over the grassy areas in Terokkar Forest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1070880</b></h3>This is an awesome pet to Power Level alts. I use them any breed I have two atm. Around Halfhill you will find a lot of critters. You can Level two pets to 25 very fast with this pet and come out full health most of the time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>maryalice</b></h3>There is something wrong with the spawn of this battle pet.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>shadowrings</b></h3>Remember this pet phases in and out just like the big warpstalkers do. That may be the reason some folks think the spawn is broken.<br /><br />I've found this as a rare B/B but not as a rare P/S. Has anyone seen the P/S as anything other than a poor quality?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>iriecolorado</b></h3>Finding a rare of this pet is roughly 1:500. Use a stone.</div>
