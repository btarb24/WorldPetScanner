The guy can not be targeted and will not jump out unless I moved 4 branch piles, the Riverbend Chompers  were not done till then.

If these little sticks are in place, then you can't see the pet/battle pet icon.</li></ol></li></ul><br /><br />Click the little sticks to remove them one at a time and at some point, when most are gone, the pet will jump out and be ready for battle.<br /><br />NOTE: I accidentally killed him in my first go, so I cleared to world quests and came back 5-ish minutes later. There were only 2-3 branches left (from my first go, and the pet was back, but he wouldn't jump out, and I couldn't start the battle with him.<br /><br />I believe the sticks need to be in place before I can attempt the stick-removal-and-fight-pet cycle again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gumbyman</b></h3>As someone had mentioned, this pet is at 71.69, 74.1. <br />The trick here is not the big branches that are all around, but a lighter coloured pile of sticks that ends up on top of the pet. (I will attach a picture of the dam)<br />- The trick is that the 2 beavers that wonder into the spot seem to build the dam of light brown sticks that form almost a web over top of the battle pet itself. DO NOT KILL THE BEAVERS if the sticks are not clickable, it appears they are the ones that appear to be building the dam.<br />- If the sticks are clickable, you can kill the beavers if they are in the way, be careful not to use AE as the battle pet will die to splash damage<br />- To access the pet, just click the branches until they are all gone then the pet becomes clickable and will pop out of the branches to fight.<br />- It is a pretty wimpy pet, or mine was, so I recommend fighting it with a Terrible Turnip or other like minded pet that has an attack that cannot kill it.<br />- There appears to be a cooldown timer if around 5 minutes once someone kills/caps the pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Amberlee</b></h3>I showed up on day 3 and FINALLY the little sticks were there to clear and free the battle pet. While I was doing this, another beaver appeared and attacked me while I was right clicking. At that exact moment, the battle pet jumped free, got clicked and... DIED WAHHH! Back to waiting...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>QuastQuan</b></h3>Last night I camped them for almost two hours, they didn't finish the damm before I went to bed. When I logged in around noon, the damm was done and clickable. After a while the damm was clickable again, but I could not battle the timbertooth a second time!<br /><br /><ul><li> Be carefull, because you have to click several times to remove all branches. So make sure to kill the two building <a href="/npc=190886/riverbend-chomper">Riverbend Chomper</a> before you start removing the branches. </li><li> Lure them away from the damm so you don't accidentially kill the pet you want. </li><li> For the same reason make sure you don't have damaging spells like Immolation Aura active!</li></ul></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SFFCorgi</b></h3>I had the bug mentioned above; I restarted several times, even tried joining a group to swap servers, but nothing worked. Now, after a Tuesday reset, it worked fine! Got chased by one of the adult (hostile) Timbertooths, the pet remained out of its dam, and was fairly easily captured. It had a rabbit and duck for secondaries, and was a grey H/P.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TheUnartist</b></h3>Just to clarify, it isn't the large birch dam that needs to be click. It will be a tiny bundle of brown sticks built exactly where the dusky timbertooth is located</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nordrassil1</b></h3>Trying Warmode On can help, it was up and available in warmode when it was not built in warmode off. Worked like a charm and now I'm the happy owner of a poor quality Dusky Timbertooth lmao. I recommend looking at a youtube video just to see what the little interactable sticks look like for clarity.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>baron126</b></h3>A watched dam never builds.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Greatspirit</b></h3>Ok I read everyone's comments did everything they said but it would not work for me for 3 tines until I figured something out that no one mention. So I will put how it worked for me and hopefully you won't break a mouse trying and never getting it to work, I was also in War Mode. Make sure your team is not going to kill this guy, he is weak, gray and always first.<br /><br />1) As someone had mentioned, this pet is at 71.69, 74.1<br />2) DO not click on the branch unless sure of all step 2 and ONLY after step 3 !<u>Check and see how many small branches are on top of the big birch tree and birch branches, the small ones are dark brown. THIS is very important ! As mention in other comment they moved only 2-3 small brown branch piles, you need to make sure at least 4 small brown branch piles ! The guy can not be targeted and will not jump out unless I moved 4 branch piles, the Riverbend Chompers were not done till then. That's why people are waiting for server reset and etc.</u><br />2a) Only the small branches are clickable, if no cogwheel to click on them someone has moved some of the branches or did it wrong and moved all the branches, If unsure wait a bit or take the chance. If you take a chance and it didn't work then go do something else and wait about a hour, give the Riverbend Chompers to come back and/or build 4 piles of small branches. If your sure there is enough branch then go to step 3.<br />3) The targetable red tagged Riverbend Chompers that wonder into the spot build the dam of brown sticks that form almost a web over top of the battle pet itself. DO NOT KILL THE Riverbend Chompers if the sticks are not clickable, it seems they are the ones that build the dam of brown sticks. If you already killed them then wait till they come back to build at least 4 stacks of brown sticks. If there is 4 stacks and you already killed the Riverbend Chompers then go for it. make sure to kill the Riverbend Chompers away from the battle pet, you might kill it with aoe and etc.<br />4) Click the brown stacks of branches if everything in step 2 and step 3 is done.<br />5) I hope this helps and enjoy the pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jezzia21</b></h3>I've been camping this all day and most of the night. No clickable sticks. I'm about to give up on this beaver...sigh. I've watched the adult beavers for 2 hours straight and got nothing. I'm open for suggestions</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aurn</b></h3>I've been waiting 7 hours for these beavers... just log in and out and get lucky. This is silly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jkizis</b></h3>almost 30min and they just keep bringing logs but nothing is being built. Do they stop building when its rdy?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>shanekuchler</b></h3>Can confirm after waiting 3 hours I went and turned on WM came back and I could instantly click on the sticks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Blymey</b></h3>Switched to warmode and the small sticks were clickable, killed the two Riverbend Chompers, clicked the small brown sticks - about 4. The pet didn't come out :-(<br /><br />Maybe there needed to be more small sticks on the stack?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mafiacow</b></h3>So lemme get this straight. We need to wait an indefinite amount of time for the adult beavers to put a tiny stick pile on the little beaver, so we can remove said stick pile?...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mmauro</b></h3>Just caught this on a regular non war mode server. Flew to the location and the pet was under the sticks (you could see the green paw print). Clicked away the sticks and was able to catch him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Madmartigan666</b></h3>Waited an hour and a half, not a single stick.<br />Switched to WM, 5+ sticks there.<br />BTW he was LVL 25 &amp; White quality.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sodal</b></h3>Found the <a href="/object=384857/beaver-dam">Beaver Dam</a> with lots of small, thin, brown sticks. Tried to make out how many different sets of sticks I could interact with, tought 5 sets and killed the two chompers building the dam. Made a screenshot (submitted for this page) of the dam with the sticks. Cleared the 5 sets of sticks, nothing happend for a second or two and then the <a href="/npc=189657/dusky-timbertooth">Dusky Timbertooth</a> appeared, started the pet battle, caught it and won.<br /><br />While cropping, writing a caption and submitting the screenshot... the chompers were back, the set of 5 clickable brown sticks were back (probably due to phasing while the nearby <a href="/npc=201673/kretchenwrath">Kretchenwrath</a> was killed. So in a space of max. 10 minutes I got two <a href="/npc=189657/dusky-timbertooth">Dusky Timbertooth</a>s, guess it was my lucky day.<br /><br /><b>Update</b>: Apparently the screenshot wasn't accepted for some reason, it's been a lot longer than the 3 days indicated. Anyway, because you have to clear 5 <i>sets of sticks</i>, and the difference between 4 and 5 sets is a bit difficult to make out, take your time while verifying, before killing the chompers. Kill them with 4 sets of sticks up, and your chance at the battle pet is gone for a while. I've just got the third of the different breeds of <a href="/npc=189657/dusky-timbertooth">Dusky Timbertooth</a> and can forget about all those sticks from now on. ;-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>thebl4ckd0g</b></h3>After I removed all the sticks, he didn't pop out. I had to fly back to Valdraaken, enable war mode, fly back again, remove the sticks again, and he popped up as being able to be battled. Kinda buggy, Blizzard.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Katyna11286</b></h3>Can confirm that turning Warmode on WORKED. I was waiting for around 2-3 hours watching the beavers build a dam and never saw one damn stick. Teleported to SW, turned on Warmode and went back and BOOM stick pile was there and clickable. I killed beavers and was ready to start removing sticks. I counted 4 but I guess you do need 5 because he was still not able to interact for a pet battle... :( about to give up on this one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>GamerYubi</b></h3>Head to the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=190886/riverbend-chomper">Riverbend Chomper</a> Dam near Forkriver Crossing in Ohn'ahran Plains to find this Pet.<br /><br />Coords: /way #2023 71.69, 74.18 Dusky Timbertooth<br /><br />Even if you see the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=189657/dusky-timbertooth">Dusky Timbertooth</a> on your minimap and the green paw icon over it, you can't interact with it until there's a bundle of small brown sticks on top of it. I waited several hours on Stormrage for it, but it never populated.<br /><br />Don't waste your time camping this site waiting for the sticks. <br /><br />Instead, use the Premade Groups finder and join random quest groups to realm hop until you find one with the clickable-sticks present. Then, click the sticks 4 or 5 times and the Dusky Timbertooth will pop out of the dam.<br /><br />Captured the pet within 5 minutes. Make sure you have pets in battle slots that are ready to capture the Beast. Use a pet family and attack spell that doesn't hit particularly hard. Finished off the other two pets with a <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=61314/crimson-moth">Moth</a>.<br /><br />Happy capturing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Spilledstars</b></h3>Not to be <b><i>at all</i></b> confused for the only place the <b><u>tiny timbertooth</u></b> spawns, which is on the river beach a bit toward the low waterfall downstream of here, on the side away from Cinderwind (or the place where the suffusion camp goes when it's not up).</div>
