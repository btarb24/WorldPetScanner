There IS NO CAVE. First you have to go off the coast until it says South Seas, not above Nazmir like it says here, THEN you put in the \/way 54.54 7.3.

There is a rock blocking you from seeing it.  If you head into the cave and turn toward the entrance, the pebble is behind the rock (now right side since you are turned) between it and a slab of meat.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>CronoLink</b></h3>To be clear, you DON'T need someone else's Uuna! It can be your own Uuna, provided that:<br />1) You have followed her personal quest to have her powered-up.<br />2) You summon Uuna close to Baa'l and wait for her to say her words (Ooooh, I know what to do with guys like this! Eat Stars, bad guy! Get him, friend. Use your pet battle attack!).<br /><br />Once that's done, Baa'l's hp should go from 8k+ to 1k+ and do normal attacks instead of one-shotting your pets. Make sure your pets are lvl25! Once he is defeated (you cannot capture it, btw) you should receive Baa'l's Darksign to add him to your pet roster.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Saerynne</b></h3>Another trick for getting the 7th pebble (on the back of the sunken ship) is to have a warlock put unending breath and a soulstone on you before you head out. <br /><br />As long as you can make it to the back of the ship before you die of fatigue you can rez using the soulstone and have just enough time to grab the pebble before you die again. I was able to get the pebble with only those 2 buffs, a water walking mount, and the pond nettle mount - no other speed enhancements.<br /><br />Good luck and happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Morlden</b></h3>Anyone know if there is a way to get him to say that comment he did the first time you summoned him?<br />&quot;Souls fEast on enDless shrieKing, in darKNess they writhe and scream, yOu WiLl join thEm, toGether forEver morE!&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rioma</b></h3>I gots him! yay! <br />No Uuna, My chain partner had her but she wasnt upgraded! <br />So we went over on warmode, and 3 people had Uuna, Not one was upgraded lol.<br />So My chain partner decided to go level up her Uuna, but first we turned off warmode. I decided to head over and wait while eating my cold left-over sausage and veggies at 3am, when all of a sudden Baa'l SHRUNK! No clue why, there were a few people around but I saw not one Uuna! So I'm sure she was there, just maybe I couldn't see her. Anyways! I screamed in voice chat for my chain partner to hurry up and hearth to her garrison and get over here! <br />She made it with moments to spare before he grew up again. <br /> This was an evil line of many deaths , being Horde more so than any Alliance would encounter, but it was fun. I highly suggest doing this with a friend so you have something to talk about when you die over, and over, and over. My Demo Lock Loves her new Demon Goat !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rhinox1322</b></h3>Some useful information for the Baa'l line it may not be in order just helpful information to add<br />to whats already been a huge amount of work on other peoples parts thank you all:<br /><br />Download the Tom Tom addon you will need it a lot.<br /><br />As far as it's been determined you can pick back up on this line in sequence even if you've<br />been disconnected or like me get stuck needing legion flying, which you will need or a <br />friend with a two person mount and legion flying.<br /><br />1: At the lighthouse if you go right instead of left up to the lighthouse you can jump over to a cliff <br />that is right above the cave entrance for the pebble there instead of using a Glider.<br /><br />2: When you are going for the back of the ship pebble in the fatigue zone have an underwater <br />mount, water breathing, (if you have the perk for faster mount speed after landing on a flight <br />path this is very helpful here as long as it's active) and be ready to die you won't make it out <br />that one alive even if successful so leave the armor in the bank so your repair bill isn't sky high.<br /><br /> 3: Invisibility potions for the Clatterback caves or be prepared to die, if you stand still while <br />activating the pebble they will not attack so you can hearth from here but you're not able to <br />use your whistle as you will be inside the cave. Alternatively if you have a run boost fast enough ( dash, <br />wraith walk, etc..) you can possibly evade the Clatterbacks ( As a DK with Wraith Walk and death's <br />advance I can attest it worked for me, mage blink and invisibility should work too).<br /><br />4: In Boralus in the garden maze you have to be at the tree not in the area adjacent to the tree <br />in the maze that leads to the cellar, when I entered the correct cellar I was attacked by 6 Non-elite <br />Guards and was not flagged. As far as I can tell there are only a few PVP flagged guards outside <br />the maze.<br /><br />5: When going for the underwater cave for the last pebble have a water-walking mount, <br />or water walking spell of some kind on you. I suggest getting a diving suit or the best swim speed<br />you can. Above water mount speed is key here at least until we have flying mounts so you do <br />not get fatigued to death (i suggest leaving armor in the bank for this as well) <br />The Run: go to Nazmir go up the coast near Voldun<br />A: Enter Coordinates /way Zandalar 46.3 4 (theres a space between 46.3 and 4 btw)<br />this is the starting point nearest the no fatigue zone I have found.<br />B: Enter coords:/way Zandalar 47.7 -3 (negative 3) to get to the underwater island no fatigue zone<br />if you look close enough on the minimap you will see a slight difference in color of the sea bottom<br />thats where it is in the lighter areas follow along these areas to get to the underwater cave.<br />C: Enter coords /way Zandalar 55.72 -10.21 (negative 10.21) start in the no fatigue zone use <br />mount or other swim speed and follow the dot down the sea cliff until you see the opening <br />swim in drop your fatigue and grab the pebble back near the entrance.<br /><br />6: **<b>Important</b>** finish the entire world tour with Uuna or you will not be able to weaken Baa'l.<br /><br />If you are planning to help your guildmates get Baa'l make sure they are there to do it when you are <br />because your Uuna will not weaken Baa'l once you defeat him, Learned this the hard way with some <br />disappointed guildmates as I had already obtained Baa'l and they could not now unless they do Unna's<br />line themselves or have someone else that has not completed it yet.<br /><br />Baa'l is located behind collosal's fall in frostridge coords 62.3 23 inside the volcano, you can walk <br />on the lava inside here.<br /><br />If you're Horde when you get the last pebble just hearth back to your garrison,<br />if you're Alliance you'll have to fly over to do it.<br /><br /> Don't worry about caging him just defeat him the collar will be placed in your bag when you have.<br /><br />Thanks for reading I really hope this helps clarify and simplifies this all for everyone<br />Happy Hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lillyrose</b></h3>A friend just did this and found a way to get the last pebble without dying...<br /><br />When you get to the cave underwater you will Fatigue, but if you get close to dying before getting the pebble, swim a little bit into the cave and the fatigue will wear off, then you can go back to the pebble.</div>

After spending hours doing the Uuna quests and world tour, then the pebbles, spent a couple more hours turning WM on and off, logging in and out, reloading, switching realms, bringing upgraded summon and dismissing Uuna 50 times, and the thing still has full health.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bdamages</b></h3>7th Pebble:<br /><br />After several near and not-so-near misses, I found what I think is the closest &quot;non-fatigue&quot; point to start the run to this object, 55.37 11.99, 442 yards away, per Tom Tom. Still barely made it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bdamages</b></h3>9th Pebble:<br /><br />Easier for me to spot/click from inside the cave, facing out, with the wagon wheel on the right of my screen.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bdamages</b></h3>10th Pebble:<br /><br />Used 18 sec invis pot at cave mouth, ran to pebble, stood right over it and clicked.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bdamages</b></h3>11th Pebble:<br /><br />Once again, it was easiest for me to get behind the object, with my back to the rear wall, and face the cave entrance, about 15 degrees right of facing the entry. Was able to see/click without using a severe camera angle.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bdamages</b></h3>13th Pebble:<br /><br />You can swim underwater right to the edge of the underwater &quot;high ground&quot; just above the cliff face that contains the cave entrance and still be un-fatigued. Drop your water walking mount when you get close and navigate below the surface. Underlight angler works great. From there, easy to get into cave before fatigue timer gets you. Once in the cave, you can swim all the way to the interior dry area and lose fatigue once again before clicking the pebble near the cave entry. Dry area also a great place to hearth from once you have pebble.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aureliana</b></h3>Uuna didn't weaken him on my first fight attempt and I abandoned it. Then as I had him targeted I saw his health suddenly drop, so I engaged him again and his total health was only about 1117. One shot him with a dragonkin pet. It seemed to be tied to her yelling, so if she yells after you begin the battle and he hasn't been weakened yet, try forfeiting the match and restarting. I was not in Warmode.<br /><br />Ba'al says some strange things which may be clues to further mysteries. Take note of the letters in all caps. The first thing he said to me, when you took out the capital letters only, seems to say &quot;SEED KNOWLEDGE&quot; or perhaps &quot;SEEK KNOWLEDGE&quot;. It is a little garbled.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>thedosmann</b></h3>I ran into some problems that I couldn't easily find answers for so I'm leaving what I found here. My toon was a shadow priest, so some issues were caused by the character. <br />On both 7 and 13 pebbles I had to use <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=152564/feast-of-the-fishes#taught-by-item">Feast of fishes</a> and, of course <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=133681/crispy-bacon">crispy bacon</a>- everything is better with bacon. This allowed all the under-water stuff to work without worry. Learning the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=152565/recipe-feast-of-the-fishes">recipe </a>for that required some time fishing.<br />Doing the whole UUna thing was weird and way time consuming but I finished and faced Ba'al. At first she didn't weaken him but then I hugged her and she hugged back and then she weakened him. So I some how missed that step.Get her to hug you before you face Ba'al.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>djkillj0y</b></h3>Just and FYI after trying to help a friend. Either Baa'l is only visible to the character who completed the pebbles and it's not account wide, or after beating and catching him he won't appear again. Had someone who had no uuna and tried to get him debuffed to no avail.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tlorsa</b></h3>Has anyone noticed a new animation with Baa'l as of very late May or the beginning of June 2019? Whereas before I only saw him rearing back on his hind legs and hopping, or leaping while spinning and hopping, yesterday I started noticing that he now also sometimes either starts one of these animations but then crumples forward onto the ground, or crumples after completing an animation. While it looks as though it's modeled off of a real-world kid flopping with their front legs splayed forward, I've never seen this before.<br /><br />Not sure if it just never fired before (I've had him out a lot on all of my characters and am pretty sure I'd notice), or if it's new, or if it heralds something, or if it's something else.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>schnizol</b></h3>Unsurprisingly this pet is a real gun in fight against legendary pets in Nazjatar and Mechagon thanks to his Murder the Innocent attack as well as Darkflame being occasionally useful. Plus it can survive any big hit thanks to his magical racial. So, if you prefer coming up with your own strategies for pet encounters, I strongly suggest considering Baa'l :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jeolene</b></h3>Updating some info I've found for 8.2.5:<br /><br />Much of this can be done with flying now, so keep that in mind when heading to places where you need to jump or glide.<br /><br />The info for the seventh pebble is terribly inaccurate. There IS NO CAVE. First you have to go off the coast until it says South Seas, not above Nazmir like it says here, THEN you put in the /way 54.54 7.3. This gets you about where you need to be and then literally &quot;drop anchor&quot;. The pebble is on the back of the ship, look for a skull and then the five &quot;pebbles&quot; underneath it. You want the second one from the left (counterclockwise).<br /><br />The tenth pebble in the cave with the hidden Clatterbacks is next to a slab of meat at the left of the cave. There is a rock blocking you from seeing it. If you head into the cave and turn toward the entrance, the pebble is behind the rock (now right side since you are turned) between it and a slab of meat. It's a little difficult to see, but it is there. Any stealth will work here if you have the ability. Hunters can spec into camo at Kenning's Lodge if you are not.<br /><br />Pebble 13 also needs a major update. Whether blizz changed something or TomTom is not working properly is not clear, head to Vol'dun at /way 64.15, 12.62. This will put you on the shore, then head forward a bit until you are in &quot;South Seas&quot; and put in /way 55.72 -10.21. Do not put a comma between the two coords or it will give you an error for some reason. Then follow the rest of the instructions as normal. <br /><br />I hope this helps make things less frustrating for people.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>m4DD0gg</b></h3>So obtaining this pet is currently bugged unless you can get in a group with someone with a completed Unna pet.<br /><br />The bug is in the 'World Tour' you have to do with Unna which involves taking Unna to various places around Azeroth. One of which is Gate of the Setting sun in Vale of Eternal Blossoms.<br /><br />The 8.3 content is causing the bug as Unna wont RP with the gate regardless of if you reverse time to before the invasions.<br /><br />Cant see Blizz fixing this any time soon........<br /><br />Imagine doing all that hard work for it to be bugged at the last section.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Velinae</b></h3>I started with the pebbles before finding out about Uuna like most. Waited 2 months for the Uuna Vale of Eternal Blossoms bug to get fixed. Finally completed my Uuna and went to get Baa'l. Baa'l was not there. Did research and the most likely cause: pebbles. Reopened up my pebble macro and unfortunately all my pebbles I spent hours and thousands of gold in repairs to get reset. Heads up! GET UUNA FIRST! Everyone else I have seen do the pebbles first haven't had theirs reset but if you're unlucky like me, they'll reset. I sent in a ticket hoping for help but hopefully this comment will save someone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zharshoul</b></h3>While most likely based on the typical satanic goat/baphomet demon thing, I was surprised to learn there is also a real life Japanese black goat creature called a &quot;serow&quot; it has a lot of lore and history around it and is small ish can come in a dark black.<br /><br /> <i>Japan, the Japanese serow is most commonly known as kamoshika or kamoshishi. It has historically been given a variety of names, often based on its appearance, some of which translate as &quot;mountain sheep&quot;, &quot;wool deer&quot;, &quot;nine tail cow&quot;, and &quot;cow demon&quot;. Regional names abound, some of which translate as &quot;dancing beast&quot;, &quot;foolish beast&quot;, or &quot;idiot&quot;. Japanese people often characterize the serow as &quot;weird&quot; or &quot;abnormal&quot;, and it is seen as a &quot;phantom animal&quot; as it tends to live alone in the depths of distant forests, and appears to observe forest workers from areas high in the mountains</i><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Unrelated but I heavily suspect that the pokemon absol is based on this animal, with its whole elusive,mysterious demon shtick it has going.</div>

MAKE SURE YOU DO THE WORLD TOUR that comes AFTER the <a href="/npc=128396/uuna">Uuna</a> scenario. Don't be like me and assume the tour you do to get to the scenario and the world tour are the same, They are 2 different things. When I read everything at first I read about a &quot;world tour&quot; and assumed all the running around to get to the <a href="/npc=128396/uuna">Uuna</a> scenario was the tour. However it is not. I went as far as farming the <a href="/item=98136/gastropod-shell">Gastropod Shell</a> to reset <a href="/npc=141941/baal">Baa'l</a> since I thought he was bugged. <br /><br />I figured it out because I put in a ticket and got a cookie cutter response back. I thought it was odd I got the type of response I did in regards to a bug. It then got me thinking. It's not a bug it was 100% a failure on my part. The cookie cutter response telling me they cannot help was loud and clear. I ended up looking at several different guides because some of the scripts to see progress were broken. I found one for world tour and it showed I had not done it. <br /><br />Check your world tour status AFTER the <a href="/npc=128396/uuna">Uuna</a> scenario where you chase off the soul eaters<br /><br />/run local a={50140,50141,50142,50143,50144,50145,50146,50147}for i,q in ipairs(a)do print(format(&quot;<a href="/npc=128396/uuna">Uuna</a> World Tour %s: %s&quot;,i, C_QuestLog.IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(q) and &quot;\124cFF00FF00Done\124r&quot; or &quot;\124cFFFF0000Not Done\124r&quot;)) end<br /><br />Hope yall have a wonderful day and GL w/ <a href="/item=162690/waist-of-time">Waist of Time</a>! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>huspomike</b></h3>Later on, in your internet searches, wowhead has a fairly complete guide to finding these pebbles. <br /><br />On pebble number 8, which hides in a basement area within Boralus, please beware. DO NOT ENTER THE OBVIOUS BREAKROOM at TomTom co-ordinates . This is a a 'false' breakroom, with guards who decline to aggro our hero unless they are attacked first. Also, the furniture is laid out all wrong.<br /><br />You need to fly around a bit more, and locate a 2nd breakroom which seems to be hiding in the bushes. 5 or 6 guards will instantly attack any Horde players. (they are easily overcome, just get to lvl 58 and be patient). In the bushes, at the 2nd breakroom, you'll find the appropriate architecture and your PEBBLE. <br /><br />Best of luck!</div>
