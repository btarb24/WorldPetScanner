Tail sweep is exceptionally strong when Onyxian Whelpling is slower than its opponent, so much so that you want to be going last when using this pet.\n\n\nTactically, this pet works very well against most opponents, and does especially well against faster opponents (almost everything), aquatic and magic families and creatures with flying attacks. It also does well against opponents dependent on big attacks with long cooldowns, because it has two abilities to mitigate such attacks.\n\nThe key to using this pet well is being able to anticipate enemy actions (pretty much all the daily trainers, Pandarian elemental spirits and beasts of fable are very predictable once you get to know them) - and if you can plan 3-4 moves ahead, she is exceptionally adept against most opponents.\n\nThe standard rotation I employ with this little fella is as follows:\n\n[ul]\n[li]Open with a Tail Sweep[\/li]\n[li]If your opponent hit in the first round, follow up with a Healing Flame, or alternatively, if your opponent didn't hit you in the last round, Tail Sweep again and wait a turn to heal once your opponent has actually hit you. Since the Spawn of Onyxia goes second your heal will heal for most of the first 2 attacks[\/li]\n[li]Lift Off[\/li]\n[li]Tail Sweep[\/li]\n[li]Healing Flame[\/li]\n[li]Tail Sweep until Healing Flame is available again, then start again because all your abilities will be off CD.[\/li]\n[\/ul]\n\nI will however deviate from this rotation when I know my opponent has one or more key abilities.\n\nLift Off is very handy to dodge big attacks. For example use Lift Off on the same round that you know your opponent will use [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=159] Burrow[\/url]\/[url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=564]Dive[\/url]. Alternatively use it in the round before something like [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=508]Moth Dust[\/url] (hits hard and has a chance of putting your pet to sleep) or else anything that puts a nasty dot on you.\n\nSecondly, because Healing Flame adds additional healing equal to half of the last hit you took, it is often beneficial to time it for the rounds in which you know a big hit will land, but Lift Off is on CD.\n\nThirdly, the dragonkin special ability makes it do serious bonus damage (+50%) in the round after dealing any hit that leaves your opponent below 25% health. However this buff does not reapply itself if it is already active. If it drops off however, hitting an opponent again leaving it below 25% (or dead) will reapply the buff for another round. What this means is that if you hit an opponent and get it below 25%, but don't kill it, it is often worth using either Healing Flame followed by a Tail Sweep, or alternative Lift Off, to get the killing blow. This would result in the buff being up for the first round against the next opponent, instead wasting the buff to do 500+ damage to a pet on 50 health.\n\n\nIf you are fortunate enough to own an Onyxian Whelpling, teaming it together with a Spawn of Onyxia makes for a duo that can reliably take down most daily trainer teams by themselves without even needing a third pet - meaning you can use them to power level your other pets.  Even against teams where this pairing is not ideal, I almost always have a spot for Onyxian Whelpling in my lineup. \n\nFor people who sadly don't have an Onyxian Whelpling available to them, Spawn of Onyxia (breed #4) is a great substitute, which does almost as well, and you'll definitely be wanting at least 2 of these. I strongly suggest saving a [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/item=92683]Flawless Dragonkin Battle-Stone[\/url] (or 2) for just this purpose, since farming for a rare of a specific breed can be somewhat time consuming and frustrating.","date":"2013-04-10T10:57:35-05:00","rating":24,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2013-05-08T02:34:44-05:00",1,"LSavage"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":5,"id":1913072,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Untamable","body":"This pet is EXCELLENT against flying types of pets.
