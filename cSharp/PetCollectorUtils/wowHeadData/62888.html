Let me clarify, you cannot escape this. I thought that [i]maybe[\/i] I could spirit-walk back to Hyjal and take rez sickness at a Hyjal graveyard. No, it sends you back to Ashenvale. I could feel the troll face of the Blizzard employee who implemented that. Mass Resurrection is your best friend.\r\n\r\n[b]-[\/b] Speaking of Mass Resurrection, be prepared to undergo it a lot. There are so many places phased; my friends must have swapped 6 different toons and STILL were phased in some areas. \r\nHowever, if it wasn't obvious enough, Mass Resurrection does work throughout any phasing if you are in range.\r\n\r\n[b]-[\/b] The hardest part about walking to Nordrassil's inn, is the Sulfuron Spire and all the mobs relating to it. Let me clarify, that location itself is not bad. In fact, if you can heal, the lava only hurts you for -600 every 3 seconds, and that's wonderful in comparison to the amount of mobs that will seemingly feel you in vicinity and attack you from 10,000 yards away. Just be prepared for the worst, because the Scorched Plain (the land near the Spire) certainly is it.\r\n\r\n[b]-[\/b] Fireland's summoning stone will work. I know that it works for anything over level 20, but let's be honest, who would expect that after the amount of ridiculous precautions they put in to keep lowbies out of this zone unless they are as determined as I am?\r\n\r\n[b]-[\/b] And lastly, if you [i]do[\/i] release your spirit, you'll be happy to know that you can spirit-fly once you're back in Hyjal.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>alfonzzo</b></h3>These are found around the Nordrassil Inn. I've found them anywhere in that valley, even across the lake. They are not common though. If you don't see any, just keep clearing battle pets, and eventually one will spawn.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I have yet to see one as a secondary pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1038930</b></h3>Spent several hours clearing wild pets in hopes of catching one for the safari achieve. Eventually, after having no luck, I decided to log onto a different toon (one on another server that hadn't done any Mount Hyjal quests) and check it out. Lo and behold, there was a group of them just chillin' in front of the inn. Phasing issue? Really bad luck? Who knows. :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>516399</b></h3>Farmed this little guy for a few days. Wasn't until a recent server reset where I was able to snag a rare.<br /><br />Caught my first rare 10 minutes after reset, but had to choose between it and completeing Galleon. Left this rare to get the world boss, came back to farming and instantly got another rare. Lucky me I guess after hours of searching.<br /><br />Was very helpful in taking down the pandarian tamers as their elite/legendary flying pets where easily locked down by this quickly<br /><br />Flash -&gt; Light -&gt; Arcane Explosion is killer combo, especially if started with this guy as arcane will take health off their back pets while waiting for the cd reset on Flash and Light</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>269813</b></h3>I would just like to mention that you can farm every single &quot;Unique to Hyjal&quot; pet as well as almost all of the others in Hyjal from the small area of Nordrassil. This area also has a fairly quick respawn time, I've never gone more than 30 seconds without finding another pet to battle. While farming for <a href="/npc=62888/nordrassil-wisp">Nordrassil Wisp</a> I have gotten nearly every other pet in Hyjal as either an Uncommon or a Rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1046597</b></h3>This wisp is great in pet battles. The ability Flash does a modest amount of damage but impairs enemy accuracy by 50% for two rounds (the tooltip on the ability is incorrect; check the debuff in-game when used.) It severely hampers enemy damage capabilities, especially if you can correctly predict when their heavy hitting long-cooldown abilities are about to be used.<br /><br />Follow this up with Light, which hits twice against blinded targets, and the wisp begins to really hit hard. Pair with a pet that has Call Darkness for extra fun. Call Moonlight will also give this pet a 10% damage boost on all abilities.<br /><br />If using these two abilities, your third ability is limited to either defensive ability on a long cooldown or an offensive ability with no cooldown that hits the whole team. Choose the latter. Flash / Light as often as possible, and AoE the rest of the time. <br /><br />The wisp can be surprisingly hardy due to Flash's blinding effect, and the AoE damage he puts out whittles away at back rank pets when they have no opportunity to use defensive abilities to mitigate the damage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Khazi</b></h3>Do these always have speed as their focus stat?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jeolene</b></h3>so, I was doing what other suggested and going around to clear other critters/battle pets, but it was a bit of a pain not being able to target. I noticed there were quite a few of the Silky Moths around the pond area, so I made a simple macro:<br /><br />/tar silky moth<br />/startattack<br /><br />Then I just continued to clear the moths almost non-stop and the Wisp finally showed up, might have been a coincidence, but it sure was faster than trying to click on them manually :D<br /><br />*edit* on a side note, got home from work (about 2am) and I happened to pass by on my way to Winterspring and I noticed these little guys were EVERYWHERE. I'm curious now to see if maybe they might be a nocturnal critter, again it might just be coincidence, but there were a lot of them and I didn't have to kill any other critters to get them to spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nyctalops</b></h3>Aren't Wisps, like, dead night elves? Does this mean my nelf druid may be using her own grandma in pet battles?<br /><br />Sweet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aquifel</b></h3>Just a note for anyone dreading farming this one, it is rare, but not like scourged whelpling/minfernal rare. You should have one (maybe not in a good quality) within 15-20 minutes without too much effort, just stick to the right area, and kill ones that aren't the ones you're looking for.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>decembre</b></h3>This pet set up with Light/Flash/Soul Ward has become a favorite of mine on almost every difficult pet opponent as it has extremely high survivability. Even against an epic mechanical (what it's weak against), because of its high avoidance it can eventually whittle it down while still having half its life. On some battles and a little luck, the wisp can power through two epic opponents.<br /><br />Open with Flash, then the next round use Light. Now here's the key: be sure to pass after the round you use Light. The target is still blinded and will have a chance to miss this attack. Then use Soul Ward--the target will lose blinded this round, but Soul Ward will block the next attack completely. Then repeat.<br /><br />The enemy will be blinded 3/4 of the time, and the round it isn't you are guaranteed a block.<br /><br />My cheesy dream team is three of these fellas. I'm off to farm!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cephadex</b></h3>At the risk of being down-rated, is it just me, or is there something a bit wrong lore-wise about wisps being classed as magic? NEs were opposed to magic, they wouldn't have magical beings circling their trees or what have you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>alpanhell</b></h3>I decided to check to see if there was a phasing issue. I checked on my 90 mage that had done all the hyjal quests including Molten Front dailies and was no Wisps. I hopped on my 90 monk who had never even been to Mt Hyjal (leveled through Vash) and flew to Hyjal not even taking starting quest and once I got there saw one Wisp. I then took starting quest and used that to get there and saw another Wisp when I arrived.<br /><br />I doubt there are any phasing issues. unless there is per some intermediate quests. As far as I remember that area doesn't phase at all.<br /><br />My bad it does phase around Thrall.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1069318</b></h3>I found mine on the other side of the lake from the Inn (and it was rare, yay!). If you have any 90 friends cross server have them invite you so you can check their server for spawns too. I've found a lot of rarer pets this way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kamiccolokuetan</b></h3>This took me about 20 minutes to find and was a common quality. I then found one about 30 minutes later and was common again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rhuinn</b></h3>its about 5 am server time and the entire area around the inn is FULL of these. there are no other types of battle pets in the area at all...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Catriona</b></h3>Took me over a week of farming nightly to find a rare one. I used them to power-level other pets with an Onyxian Whelpling's Breath doing most of the work - at level 10 most pets can generally survive one hit, and they ding a level and more with each battle. The best one to fight has Arcane Explosion instead of Soul Ward, which gets very, very tiresome (you can spend a good 5 minutes smacking the Wisp down because of Soul Ward and Flash). Most of the other fights in the area are critters, which I used the Baby Blizzard Bear to decimate, with the occasional Silky Moth.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1087618</b></h3>after 2 hours farming , i got my Rare one with 1400 hp , 227 attack , 357 speed<br /><br />he is faster than almost all pets except flying ones which take 50% extra damage from it. and with the 3 abilities rotation, its enemy will either have a -50% accuracy debuff or +100% block chance. very strong for pvp , almost no weak point. yes they take 50% extra damage from dragons but they can hardly hit the wisper</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1087618</b></h3>btw , just to metion how to power lvl a pet , get 2 lvl25 moth and take any lvl1 pet to the pool behind Aki the choosen, there are only lvl24 to 25 Aquatic pet there and they have a 90% chance to not use a damage attack on 1st round which can make ur lvl1 pet survive. after 1 fight , your pet can jump to lvl5 .</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1061544</b></h3>I am confirming the phasing issue for this pet. I cleared other battle pets and critters for 30 minutes on a Loremaster toon to no avail. I logged into my ONLY fresh level 80, killed battle pets for about 5 minutes and a few spawned across the lake with no issue.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1101420</b></h3>I have been over here before to get this pet for the achievement &quot;Kalimdor Safari&quot; at that time I had only killed one and it was poor quality.<br /><br />I just got to this zone to level my next set of pets and got a rare quality Nordrassil Wisp for my first one. <br /><br />Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bengrimm99</b></h3>I don't know if this has been said or not, but this is day 3 of &quot;Wisp Hunt 2013&quot; and I've yet to see one as a secondary team member. If you didn't pick the fight with a wisp you won't get one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>remid0d0s0</b></h3>These are magic pets with an interesting and useful move set.<br /><br />Farming a rare can take some time. It's not like looking for a minfernal, but it's not all that much better. It seems that only a half dozen or so wisps are spawned at once, and when you battle (or kill) them, they respawn slowly, even if you go around killing off other battle pets and critters.<br /><br />They don't ever spawn as secondary pets as far as I can tell.<br /><br />I did eventually farm a rare but it took me hours. I got several pets leveled from 1 to 20+ in the process though, because I pretty quickly gave up trying to force more wisps to spawn by killing critters and pets, and instead fought everything in the area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gfysprez</b></h3>From the first day I played (more then 4 years now) I've wanted one of these &quot;elf&quot; wisps as a pet - thank you Blizzard for letting me get one</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pinkiepieisfly</b></h3>After spending two hours traveling from Eastern Kingdoms to Kalimdor, to Darnassus, to Ashenvale, to Felwood, to Winterspring, to Mount Hyjal, and to dying in Mount Hyjal at least 10 times and accidentally ressurrecting in Ashenvale, I can safely confirm that this is not nub-friendly and you should probably get this pet on a level 90.<br /><br />If you are, however, going to go to Hyjal on a lowbie (or in my case, a level 58 named Yolobear) to get this pet anyway, let me lay out these key facts:<br /><br /><b>-</b> Releasing your spirit puts you in Ashenvale. Let me clarify, you cannot escape this. I thought that <i>maybe</i> I could spirit-walk back to Hyjal and take rez sickness at a Hyjal graveyard. No, it sends you back to Ashenvale. I could feel the troll face of the Blizzard employee who implemented that. Mass Resurrection is your best friend.<br /><br /><b>-</b> Speaking of Mass Resurrection, be prepared to undergo it a lot. There are so many places phased; my friends must have swapped 6 different toons and STILL were phased in some areas. <br />However, if it wasn't obvious enough, Mass Resurrection does work throughout any phasing if you are in range.<br /><br /><b>-</b> The hardest part about walking to Nordrassil's inn, is the Sulfuron Spire and all the mobs relating to it. Let me clarify, that location itself is not bad. In fact, if you can heal, the lava only hurts you for -600 every 3 seconds, and that's wonderful in comparison to the amount of mobs that will seemingly feel you in vicinity and attack you from 10,000 yards away. Just be prepared for the worst, because the Scorched Plain (the land near the Spire) certainly is it.<br /><br /><b>-</b> Fireland's summoning stone will work. I know that it works for anything over level 20, but let's be honest, who would expect that after the amount of ridiculous precautions they put in to keep lowbies out of this zone unless they are as determined as I am?<br /><br /><b>-</b> And lastly, if you <i>do</i> release your spirit, you'll be happy to know that you can spirit-fly once you're back in Hyjal. Maybe it was the lowly speed of my <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=125154">Spirit Roll</a>, but that made me so happy.<br /><br />With only a few pets left for Zookeeper, I HAD to make it interesting, somehow. But this wasn't the best idea I've ever had. *Cough* <br /><br />And a small reminder: While this isn't exactly related to the pet, I only did this for the pet. Maybe someone else is as crazy as me and would like to attempt this, too. You don't know them. But don't downrate with, &quot;HURR DURR THIS AINT HELPING ME CAMP MY PET,&quot; because all the information possibly needed for this pet has already been posted by users. And moreso, this was a joke. I did actually do this, but my hopes in writing this was to make someone laugh. Hugs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ksquared6000</b></h3>Lvl 90 hunter, all Hyjal quests completed. Was battling silky moths and having issues with my pet window. I exited game and logged back in. To my delight, there was a wisp circling directly behind me. I was so excited...my first wisp and....OMG...it's a rare! A few minutes later, a second spawn...uncommon. Within 30 minutes, a third spawn...common.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TevishSzat</b></h3>Flash/Light/Soul Ward is an interesting set-up for this pet. On one side, it generates dead turns and is very reliant on precise cooldown management. On the other hand, the reduced enemy accuracy and automatic block provide a lot of longevity while a boosted Light does respectable damage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mewmewface</b></h3>Ok so the first time i farmed for this (just looking for it, not killing them on random) I came upon a rare, but I was absent minded and daydreaming, accidentally it. :/<br /><br />I kept looking for it for a long long tiem and I couldnt find a rare anymore after that, I even leveled an uncommon to 25 and I have the stones to make it rare but i was just not convinced.<br /><br />Now its 3:23 am and after a while of camping my server and my alliance alt server I finally found a rare, 300 speed and 200 plus power...seems my uncommon is better.<br /><br />Oh well, this guy doesnt appear as a secondary pet, by the way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>40394</b></h3>Last night on Lothar I patrolled around the Nordrassil Inn at 9 pm server and 10:30 server, and there were no wisps. I flew back after midnight, and there were six. I also got a battle stone to upgrade the best of them to rare quality during the battles I fought to collect them.<br /><br />Maybe they spawn at midnight realm time, or maybe it was a CRZ thing, or maybe someone flew through and fought them all earlier, and their respawn duration is specific.<br /><br />I also found about the same number of critters and moths in the area each time I went through, so these seem to spawn independently of those.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>arthas28zp</b></h3>I must have searched around the inn and killed a dozen rounds of Alpine Chipmunks, Elfin Rabbits and Silky Moths with my whirling kick or lightning. <br /><br />I kept flipping back here to read the comments about CRZ issues. At one point I plopped down directly in front of the inn and logged out (I am level 90 and I did some but not all quests in the zone on the way) and then logged back in to see if maybe they magically would appear. I flew around again for one more pass and set down between two silky moths on the east side of the lake. I had just clicked &quot;customer support&quot; contemplating whether or not to open a ticket about it. Before deciding, I did a quick mouse sweep over my mini map and lo and behold, a wisp had spawned on the southeast corner of the inn! <br /><br />Turns out it was common, but after an hour of fruitless searching I was very thankful. I went back while typing this up to determine directions and found another (also common.) It occurred to me that I had probably been reading comments for 10 minutes or so, and it was 11:11pm when I saw that first wisp. I'm on an EST server don't know if that makes a difference. So maybe there is something to the time of day being a factor (re: Kaganfindel's post.) Maybe 11pm-on before they will spawn?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jmech1986</b></h3>Occasionally I come out here for the jewel crafting daily real early in the morning before work, and I will see several of these pets spawned at once.

I'm not saying this is a definite thing, I'm just reporting what I've been seeing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Naenthos</b></h3>In case anyone's interested:<br /><br />-these seem to spawn quite a bit now (there are a lot of older comments about them being dificult to find).<br /><br />-I used a level 20 rare Anodized robo cub as primary pet (for leveling purposes) and he did remarkably well considering the level difference. Wisps don't do tons of damage, but it can take a while to wear them down.<br /><br />-Still haven't found a rare yet, although I did encounter and capture a rare Grotto Vole and a rare Fire-Proof Roach as secondary pets but that may just be my luck. -edit- <i>Caught one!</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Elaera</b></h3><b>YOU NEED TO BE ON A LOWER LEVEL CHARACTER TO GET THIS ONE NOW</b><br /><br />I spent so much time on this one. I went to Hyjal with my main character (lvl 60) and could see the pet on the map and everytime I tried to get close - it phased out. <br />So I went through the raid to see if I could get it through there - nope. <br /><br />So I logged on to another character that hasn't progressed past whatever point it is that makes these pets phase out. Logged on to a lvl 46 and took the portal to Hyjal from Stormwind and could finally get it.<br /><br />So I guess there's 3 versions of Hyjal... Of which you can only access 2 with a max level character as it seems. <br /><br />This seriously needs to be fixed. Why not just have Zidormi stand there like in other zones?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kethana</b></h3>Finding a rare quality wisp of ANY breed really is a freaking nightmare. I don't get phased out, but I only get uncommon quality or lower. Never rares and I've picked fights with all wisps in the area, 4 times now.</div>
