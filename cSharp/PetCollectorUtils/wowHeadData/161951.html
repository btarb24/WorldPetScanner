<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jezartroz</b></h3>Fished this up in Vale of Eternal Blossoms, sub-100 casts (71 to be precise).<br /><br />Fished almost entirely from pools, running from just below the raid entrance (Whitepetal Lake) following the river south to the mountains. There's only 3-4 pools up at a time, but they are near instant respawn; I never spent more than 20 seconds traveling. <br /><br />Don't bother looking other areas in the zone for pools; it seems they're only spawning on the lake and connected river.<br /><br />Happy fishing :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MrMojoRisin416</b></h3>After reading the comments, I expected to be here for at least 400-500 casts. <br /><br />Killed Houndlord Ren and decided to stop for a few casts.<br /><br />Found after 2 attempts, doesn't seem to be that difficult to obtain.<br /><br />Good luck ladies and gents.<br /><br />EDIT: Found in 2nd pool at Whitepetal Lake as others stated previously.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Fogwave</b></h3>Fished this up in Uldum today, 103 casts. In a pool of Malformed Gnasher south of the lost city of the tol'vir.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pumpkinpuff</b></h3>Fished mine up today during the Aqir assault in the river by Ramkahen. This area of the map did not have the nzoth invasion outlines on the map but did spawn the pools, so if you are worried the pool isn't inside the markers, as long as you are at a pool of aberrant you have the chance to fish it up.</div>
