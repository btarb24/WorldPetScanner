It is of the utmost importance that what we discuss here is kept top secret. Should you choose to leak any of the following details, I will immediately disavow your existence and send Crithto to ensure you die a swift and quiet death. Your lips will be sealed one way or another!\r\n\r\nYour target of interest is Silas Darkmoon. Heâ€™s the purveyor of the â€œgreatest show on Azeroth,â€ but my sources tell me heâ€™s up to something sinister. Mind you, one of my sources is Topper McNabb, but thatâ€™s neither here nor there. Darkmoon is planning somethingâ€”I can feel it! And I want you to investigate his island of miscreants to see whatâ€™s really going on. Sample the goods, test each activity, and make sure youâ€™re not spotted as one of my trainees. Blend in, act like all the other seedy denizens of the island, and donâ€™t come back until you have some concrete information about the Ringleader. I need to know!\r\n\r\nOh, and while youâ€™re there, you might want to try taming a crow. It is rumored that these jackdaws carry missives from Silas to his cohorts, as well as munch on the corpses his camp is purported to leave in the adjacent woods. Donâ€™t end up one yourself! \r\n\r\nPugpedia can tell you more about this creature.\r\n\r\n\r\n[i]Crithto: Ahh, the enigmatic Crow; a diurnal shadow cawing from the tree tops, out of sight, lying in wait for a fresh body to nom on. Or leftover funnel cakes and crunchy frogs to nibble onâ€”it doesnâ€™t matter. Thereâ€™s a reason why a group of crows is referred to as a murder. And being the adventurous owner of this pet is sure to produce similar results in the Pet Battles arena. The one-two punch thatâ€™s guaranteed to send a message is Call Darkness and Nocturnal Strike. Yet this elusive avianâ€™s  ability to dish out damage doesnâ€™t stop thereâ€”especially when you combine abilities like Alpha Strike and Murder. The only advice I can give is to ensure you treat your Crow with respect. If you donâ€™t, it tends to go for the eyes first.[\/i]\r\n\r\nDonâ€™t mistake this task to be anything other than a reconnaissance mission. You are not to attempt to take down Silas or his minions at this time. Well, you can try, but itâ€™s not likely youâ€™ll survive. And even more important is to ensure you return with one of his crows. They hold secrets in their eyes and in their minds that only I can decipher. Keep in mind, the Darkmoon Faire island is a land of mystery, shrouded by something evil, and going there will require you to take advantage of all your senses. Too bad you only have five!\r\n\r\nGET MOVINâ€™, BIRD WATCHERS![\/quote]","date":"2013-11-03T00:00:58-05:00","rating":4,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":30,"id":1924272,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"657368","body":"I got mine by going up on the high cliffs.. you get there by taking a left right after you port into the area.. nobody (and I am on a locked pop busy server) was up there farming.. took two clears to get one but .. bam.. there it was.. happy hunting","date":"2013-12-07T19:30:32-06:00","rating":6,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"This is the place I caught mine after about 30-40 minutes of steady battling.","creationdate":"2018-10-13T19:17:15-05:00","id":1150348,"rating":0,"commentid":1924272,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"Maizey","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":31,"id":1931912,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"461348","body":"Because many of the glowflies are up on the ledges, I found the most efficient path for farming them (to look for crows as secondaries) is to start from the portal where you enter the island, run along the ridge to one side, eventually dropping down to get the glowflies on the forest floor.

This worked for me, and after less than a dozen glowfly bet battles I got a Crow secondary except I accidentally killed it.  I changed my team to make that less likely starting with a lvl 11 magic pet that was strong against flying, and used this to go through the battles where there was no crow.  2nd was a lvl 5 Dragonkin since that has strong defense against flying.  My thought was to use just enough attack strength to where I could start throwing traps without killing the crow.  3rd was a lvl 6 Dragonkin to survive crow attacks while throwing traps.  This worked well as the second crow I found was poor quality (after a couple dozen more glowfly battles).

I found a couple as the secondary pet in battles against wild Darkmoon Glowflies level 5 and up. The problem was that I couldn't capture them. When I moused over the trap button, it had a red message to the effect of &quot;The pet is not available to be captured.&quot; I assume this is something that will be fixed before 5.1 hits live, so when that happens, feel free to delete this post.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rewn</b></h3>Well I'm not sure if its a bug or not, but currently these don't seem to be capturable. After spending the best part of an hour searching for these, finding nothing, challenging very glowfly I met and killing every non battle-pet critter I could find, I finally found one as a secondary pet to a Glowfly but after wilting it down I was unable to throw the box.

However as the level of the Darkmoon Glowfly dictates whether you'll have a secondary pet or not, you will need to spend a lot of time and effort to camp for a rare. You should see a crow within 10 or so battles (depending on the level).<br /><br />Just confirming the existence of the rare crow which I managed to capture after ~10 crow battles.</div>

Trust me on this one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SoCalWoWGal</b></h3>From <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/11473825/Major_Payne%E2%80%99s_Pet_Menagerie_Crow-11_1_2013" rel="nofollow">Major Payneâ€™s Pet Menagerie: Crow </a><br /><br /><div class="quote-box">Given the breadth of my responsibilities and inability to fully investigate every report of devious activity, Iâ€™ve summoned all of you here to give you the details of your next mission. It is of the utmost importance that what we discuss here is kept top secret. Should you choose to leak any of the following details, I will immediately disavow your existence and send Crithto to ensure you die a swift and quiet death. Your lips will be sealed one way or another!<br /><br />Your target of interest is Silas Darkmoon. Heâ€™s the purveyor of the â€œgreatest show on Azeroth,â€ but my sources tell me heâ€™s up to something sinister. Mind you, one of my sources is Topper McNabb, but thatâ€™s neither here nor there. Darkmoon is planning somethingâ€”I can feel it! And I want you to investigate his island of miscreants to see whatâ€™s really going on. Sample the goods, test each activity, and make sure youâ€™re not spotted as one of my trainees. Blend in, act like all the other seedy denizens of the island, and donâ€™t come back until you have some concrete information about the Ringleader. I need to know!<br /><br />Oh, and while youâ€™re there, you might want to try taming a crow. It is rumored that these jackdaws carry missives from Silas to his cohorts, as well as munch on the corpses his camp is purported to leave in the adjacent woods. Donâ€™t end up one yourself! <br /><br />Pugpedia can tell you more about this creature.<br /><br /><i>Crithto: Ahh, the enigmatic Crow; a diurnal shadow cawing from the tree tops, out of sight, lying in wait for a fresh body to nom on. Or leftover funnel cakes and crunchy frogs to nibble onâ€”it doesnâ€™t matter. Thereâ€™s a reason why a group of crows is referred to as a murder. And being the adventurous owner of this pet is sure to produce similar results in the Pet Battles arena. The one-two punch thatâ€™s guaranteed to send a message is Call Darkness and Nocturnal Strike. Yet this elusive avianâ€™s ability to dish out damage doesnâ€™t stop thereâ€”especially when you combine abilities like Alpha Strike and Murder. The only advice I can give is to ensure you treat your Crow with respect. If you donâ€™t, it tends to go for the eyes first.</i><br /><br />Donâ€™t mistake this task to be anything other than a reconnaissance mission. You are not to attempt to take down Silas or his minions at this time. Well, you can try, but itâ€™s not likely youâ€™ll survive. And even more important is to ensure you return with one of his crows. They hold secrets in their eyes and in their minds that only I can decipher. Keep in mind, the Darkmoon Faire island is a land of mystery, shrouded by something evil, and going there will require you to take advantage of all your senses. Too bad you only have five!<br /><br />GET MOVINâ€™, BIRD WATCHERS!</div></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>461348</b></h3>Because many of the glowflies are up on the ledges, I found the most efficient path for farming them (to look for crows as secondaries) is to start from the portal where you enter the island, run along the ridge to one side, eventually dropping down to get the glowflies on the forest floor. Then take the portal from the docks, re-enter the island, and do the other side, then repeat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sniperorc</b></h3>This game can be slightly sadistic sometimes.<br /><br />I'm cruising around Darkmoon Isle, looking for a crow. I'm fighting and killing a lot of <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=67329">Darkmoon Glowflies</a>. I guess I wouldn't mind capturing an upgrade, since my current ones are both Uncommon quality. But it's mostly just white or gray, so I kill 'em and move on.<br /><br />I finally come upon a Rare-quality Glowfly. It's even the desirable breed, and would still be slightly higher level after capture than the ones I already have. Complete win, right?<br /><br />So, guess what the secondary pet is?<br /><br />Poor-quality very low level crow (but at least a tolerable breed, if not optimum).<br /><br />First crow I've ever seen, in hours of farming.<br /><br />That lovely glowfly... complete dead meat. But at least I got my crow.</div>

Which brings me to why i was saying &quot;LOLS&quot; the second glowfly i go to battle has a lv10 rare crow with it and i caught it. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>shadedemon</b></h3>From when I got mine, which was quite a while back, but I do still check once in a while when I'm on Darkmoon. Yes, there are other spots than the ones marked where you can get the crow, but no it wasn't every spot on the island. East (right) side of map where marked, and the one spot next back on the mountain. Also west of that spot, down from the mountain, near the cove. Think those 3 were it, but might have also been the next spot back from the cove as well. On the west side, where marked, and pretty sure the next spot back as well. Pretty sure those 5 or 6 spots were all, as a back line pet. So if you go all over the island, you're wasting a lot of time on locations that won't have it, and if you only wait for those two, you're wasting the other 3 or 4 spawn points respawning.. There were more than those 2 spots it can spawn, but they were grouped around those two spots. Kill those 5 or 6 spots a time or two and respawn and you should see a crow come up sooner rather than later.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mongotuslan</b></h3>The Crow is still available, I just got one. My strategy was to start at the entrance portal, and go around one side or the other of the Faire grounds, battling every glowfly, then go to the end of the dock and portal out. Whereupon I would find a stable master to heal my pets, then repeat. This saved on pet bandages. Battling every glowfly opens the possibility the respawn will have a crow secondary. This worked for me, and after less than a dozen glowfly bet battles I got a Crow secondary except I accidentally killed it. I changed my team to make that less likely starting with a lvl 11 magic pet that was strong against flying, and used this to go through the battles where there was no crow. 2nd was a lvl 5 Dragonkin since that has strong defense against flying. My thought was to use just enough attack strength to where I could start throwing traps without killing the crow. 3rd was a lvl 6 Dragonkin to survive crow attacks while throwing traps. This worked well as the second crow I found was poor quality (after a couple dozen more glowfly battles). My main in Shadowlands gets enough PPC to upgrade the crow to 25 rare easily.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bziuma</b></h3>The Crow is still available, I just got 2 of them on 11,02,2022.<br />Close at this cords 71 57 and 70.6 78.6<br />Crow can be found at Darkmoon Island ONLY during the Darkmoon Faire and ONLY as a Secondary pet in a pet battle.<br />Good Luck :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Moosplauze</b></h3>Still available in 2024, actually found it on the 2nd Glowfly that I battled, a S/S Crow. It was close the the DMF Pet Battle Trainers, went through the fence and battled from there. But I assume location doesn't matter, it's just rng.</div>
