<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1024110</b></h3>They have a chance of spawning when an Infested Bear spawns. Killing every Infested Bear makes about 1 or 2 spawn a minute.<br />The rare ones have 529 health, 62 power, and 55 speed at level 6.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tentenchan</b></h3>They do keep the eggs on their back, despite how it looks on the pet screen after you catch them. I do not know if this is a good or a bad thing however... Sometimes they take a moment to spawn :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1037412</b></h3>Found mines atop those rugged hills south of Azurelode Mine at 7:45am (Eastern). Cute little thing was following its mother.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sweetybyrd</b></h3>Found mine as well at the Azurelode Mine at 2045cst, I killed all the infested bears including the eggs on the back, took about 15 minutes and one spawned with a cub.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hogri</b></h3>I killed all the mothers about 3 times each and after that 4 or 5 cubs spawned. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>645883</b></h3>I believe these may follow the same pattern as the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=62375">Diemetradon Hatchling</a>s in that any bear that has spawned a cub will continue to spawn cubs. I went around and marked all the bears with a cub next to them, killed the ones without and this greatly increased the number of spawns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bloodglas</b></h3>Cutest pet, no contest</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rhinoloupe</b></h3>If you're farming these for a rare catch, kill every bear <b>except</b> the ones with cubs following them (keep track by using the raid markers). These 'mother' <a href="/npc=47204/infested-bear">Infested Bear</a>s will spawn a new Infested Bear Cub for you to battle every 7 minutes.<br /><br />The ones who do not have a cub following them will never spawn a cub, so kill them; there's a chance to spawn a new mother in its place.<br /><br />Be careful not to pull or accidentally right-click the mother when you initiate battle with the cub.<br /><br />I started out with just 2 mothers, and ended up with 8 by the time I got my rare (about 30-40 mins).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>linaomine</b></h3>Trying to collect all the wild pets but every time I see the eggs on the back of these bears I freak out just a bit.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Liri</b></h3>I found the area cubless and after 3 full clears of the bears I went into the mine and cleansed it of any spiders you could catch (There were about 10 in the mines). After the next clear of the bears one spawned with a cub :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>weslasquirrel</b></h3>Confirmed. Killing the bears will spawn a &quot;mother&quot; although it took me close to a half hour to spawn one. Looting didn't seem to speed up the respawn though, killing the bears faster did.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hezkezl</b></h3>The icon for this pet looks stoned out of its mind...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1054494</b></h3>Using the same method as for the Diemetradon Hatchling, marking &quot;Mother&quot; bears and killing those who do not have cubs created waves of Infested Bear Cub spawns for me and for my friends. <br /><br />Method was simple. If you see an infested bear without a cub, kill it. If you see the bear with a cub, place a mark on her head. Continue doing this with all of the infested bears and sometimes, when a cubless and unmarked bear dies, it will come back as a mother with a cub. All the while doing this, you are free to engage the battle pet at any point. Killing it, capturing it or dismissing the fight does not alter the respawn of the cub at all. Killing the mother, does. <br /><br />If you leave the marked mother up, she will have a new cub in 5 minutes and with an active patrol of the zone, you can have several mothers up at once.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1055252</b></h3>may be a lack but mine had no eggs lol<br /><br />now i have two and neither have eggs but both are poor :(<br /><br />showing screen shot now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1060798</b></h3>Thank you! the &quot;mark the MOTHER&quot; method worked brilliantly!<br /><br />Another thing I have found helpful in finding pets that are either camped or slow spawners is to group with a friend on another server and hopefully get dragged to their server.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1064457</b></h3>Just so you all know.. I've been following the advice by the top rated guy (rhinoloupe).. and added my own twist; kill all the other pets in the area (mostly spiders).<br /> Doing this, I got a normal and then a rare in &lt;15mins.<br /><br /> Hope that helps! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>923034</b></h3>After an hour of farming up mothers (and having one annoying little person kill <b>all</b> of my mothers halfway through :( I finally found what I sought - a small undead bear with a blue border around its portrait!<br /><br />Using my <a href="/npc=50586/mr-grubbs">Mr. Grubbs</a>, we hit it with the <a href="/pet-ability=369/acidic-goo">Acidic Goo</a> DoT, and followed it up with a <a href="/pet-ability=367/chomp">Chomp</a>. Yes! Perfect! The bear was at 51 health - the perfect amount for capturing. I threw my trap and...<br /><br />Oh no.<br /><br />My trap missed. What could I do? The next time the DoT hit it, it would die! The choices were slim. I crossed my fingers and then tried not to cry out in anguish as the little bear died. <br /><br />Then, suddenly, a glimmer of hope - the bear had come back to life! I crossed my toes and threw another trap.<br /><br />This time the trap didn't miss.<br /><br /><i>For anybody looking to farm this pet looking for rares, I would say to follow rhinoloupe's advice... Gather up &quot;mother&quot; bears who spawn cubs near them. I got 2 cubs out of each mother bear before a new mother spawned. Much faster.</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Seyla</b></h3>During an exceptionally long streak of bad luck using Rhino's Mark-and-don't-kill-the-mothers technique, i observed that at no point can more than EIGHT mothers be up at the same time. After eight had spawened, no further bears would spawn with cubs, even if I left them alone for several minutes to see if a cub would spawn later. It was only after I accidentally killed one mother than a replacement spawned in short order, but again stopped at eight.<br /><br />Also, if you are bored, do not attempt to snipe the eggs off the mothers' backs. You will fail.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1064457</b></h3>Something you might wanna keep in mind if, like Supakana you accidently kill the pet (happens to the best of us);<br /> If you close WoW, or log out, BEFORE the pet battle is over, and you log back in, the pet should be wandering around as it was before, like nothing ever happened.<br /> I've found this to be a bit of a lifesaver when trying to get Rare rares :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>scharky</b></h3>Using the prescribed &quot;Rhino&quot; method, 87 battles before the elusive Rare spawned. I named him Drippy =)<br /><br />Like with most things, persistence pays off. Happy hunting!</div>
