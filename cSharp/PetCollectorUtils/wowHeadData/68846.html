<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>701896</b></h3>Location: Surrounding Shado Pan Monastery. Mostly found on path leading from Winter Blossom flight point up to the monastery.<br /><br />So, just so everyone knows, some of these guys can be phased. My level 90 (who has done ALL the quests in Kun-Lai) could only see some of them from very high in the air and as I got close they would disappear (like the twilight fiendling). This seems especially true on the path leading up to the monastery. I brought over my lil 87, and she was able to see them. So far the majority of the ones I have found have been on the path leading up to the monastery, directly in front of the Monastery and near one of the Yet's slightly up the path past the monastery. Hope this helps and happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gaidren</b></h3>These become downright huge when combined with the item that increases pet size!<br /><br />On a more important note, these are the ultimate anti-Critter pet. They are Humanoid, so -33% damage taken from Critter attacks, yet they have a few Beast damage moves (+50% damage done to Critters). That is pretty unique....most &quot;anti&quot; pets either do more damage or take less, not both.<br /><br />So get one, level it, and bust it out against trainers with critters.</div>

Somehow i aggroed him during the fight, he was attacking me but missing every hit. <br /><br />I thought about killing him with 1 shot, but decided to pet-battle him instead, only to end up losing :l</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>paincakelt</b></h3>Does anyone else find the sound of this pet walking super annoying? I think it ought to be fixed. The movement animation is too fast as well; it looks very unnatural.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pubrulz</b></h3>I can't believe this pet isn't more heralded. This guy is a great battler with most opponents when using Deep Freeze and Takedown in combination, using Frost Shock only when needed to get the jump on the opponent. With huge &quot;dps&quot; and auto heals over time, there's not much that can take him out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sospitatrix</b></h3>If this is the runt, what would his brothers look like?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ender111</b></h3>Paired with another pet that can cast Blizzard, this pet is very dangerous to any non-elemental, and downright deadly to dragonkin. A dragonkin being switched into a battle against this pet while Blizzard is active, might as well commit suicide. I use this pet in a stun team setup with Frosty and Crimson Geode.<br /><br />Against elementals, you still have a chance for a stun, but it's better to use other pets if the opponent's pet has conflag.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wooley</b></h3>This pet seems to only spawn during the day time, spent all night trying to farm him out saw only one spawn and accidentally killed it. Came back this morning 530am server and their are many spawns. Mainly on roads near Shadow Pan Monastery and the roads up in the mountains around One Keg. Hope this helps happy hunting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>demineska</b></h3>This guy is great against critters. Even better than most of my beast battle pets that have strong attacks on critters.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wowZhenek</b></h3>this pet is ridiculous. I dunno, I never tried looking for him but when I stumbled upon P/P rare version of it I decided to try it and against any world pets (non-trainers) its absolutly nuts.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1020747</b></h3>This pet is so strong that I have beaten Legendary pets <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=68566/skitterer-xia">Skitterer Xi'a</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=68561/lucky-yi">Lucky Yi</a> with *only* him (rare of course). <br /><br />In addition to having two very strong move sets (3 great beast attacks, or 3 synergistic attacks that chill, then stun, then double damage) he is the perfect anti-Critter pet, as he takes reduced damage from being Humanoid and deals increased damage with his Beast attack set. Wonderfully OP.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Buckmoney</b></h3>A rare P/P breed is very elusive. Especially when the only Flawless Battle-stone is is 3k on the Auction House on Drak'thul at the moment</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pzypro</b></h3>This pet is one of those that works amazingly well against Legendary fable beasts quest.<br /><br />The chill &gt; deep freeze &gt; double takedown combo does close to 1,000 damage while keeping you more or less completely protected from any retaliation. After the combo finishes you can either stall out with regular attacks for the next deep freeze or switch pets for the time being.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>doubleclick777</b></h3>This pet is one of the most op one, and everyone using it are pathetic noobs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Buckmoney</b></h3>When picking breed, just go for 100% Power because 65 more HP and more speed isn't going to make a difference when you're slamming someone's face in with Takedown after a Deep Freeze</div>

I've been following all of the waypoints and suggestions here. <br /><br />But here's the thing...I cannot find any. Not on my main, not on my alts, I have Summit Kids and rabbits galore, but not one Kun-Lai Runt. I've tried everything. On the Blizz forums, someone suggested that because it was introduced after 5.1 it has a reduced spawn time after a restart, and increases...but it's Monday and I'm still not seeing any. <br /><br />Anyone have any ideas? I'd really like to get one - even if it's grey. I am getting frustrated here...it's harder to find than the Minfernal!</div>

And here I thought I was easing you into your training. How else are we supposed to mold you into a lean, mean, Pet-Battling machine! <br /><br />Fine, let's ramp things up. Meet your newest soldier: the not-so-cuddly Kun-Lai Runt! Give 'em the lowdown, pug.<br /><br /><i>Crithto : Shaking the very ground with each step it takes, the Kun-Lai Runt is an offensive powerhouse! At higher levels, the Runt can employ a 3-hit combo, chilling foes with Frost Shock, followed by a stunning Deep Freeze attack, and finishing off any foe with massive damage from its powerful Takedown</i>.</div><br /><br /><div class="quote-box">Excellent. Now, the goal here is to get you in shape and ready to conquer the mighty pets of Azeroth. Sure, you may have had trouble with my team, but whippinâ€™ you into tip-top form is my goal! This week, your job is to climb the peaks of Kun-Lai Summit, but there are a few ground rules. First, you canâ€™t use a mount. Hoof it, tamer! Second, you must visit the grummles, find the ones with the giant rucksacks, and carry three of them on your back as you head up. Thatâ€™s right, channel your inner yak! Third, you have to get there by walking backwards. From Krasarang!<br /><br />Move out!</div><br /><br />Wanders the peaks of Kun-Lai Summit. Watch your step!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shivacode</b></h3>This pet is ridiculous against critters. You can level him up easily by using him on the Uldum trainer fight against the Critter pet, even at level 23 he will kill it in 3 turns using Mangle + Rampage. Then you can use whatever other pet. Love this guy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Leilameda</b></h3>Currently there are many Bots around using three Kun-Lai Runts. Best way I have found to kill them is using a very strong and slow Snail e.g. a <a href="/npc=62246/shimmershell-snail">Shimmershell Snail</a> in H/P Breed. Now just press <a href="/pet-ability=449/absorb">Absorb</a> untill all 3 <a href="/npc=68846/kun-lai-runt">Kun-Lai Runt</a> are down.<br />You will still be 90%+ HP at the end of the fight since Kun-Lai Runts only strong abbility is a Elemental stun. Critters are Tough VS Elemental abbilitys and they can't get stunned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gharedar</b></h3>Anyone knows if they can spawn as entourage to other pets, like the Summit Kid and The Hare, which are all I see sadly &gt;&lt;</div>

I'm seriously considering using a stone on a grey one(oh, you bet there are a million of those!). Worst part is that there usually aren't that many around to begin with, maybe 3-5. I have no idea about the respawn time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Eaglecreek49</b></h3>Thought I would return Pandaria and try and pick up a runt since Ive only recently gotten into pet battles. After 2 hours of cruising the Mts around Shadow pan Monastery Ive yet to see one of these at any quality. It seems like they were much easier to find when I wasnt actually looking for one. Have they become a gold commodity recently or something, because im not seeing them anywhere.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TheWheatOne</b></h3>I've heard that Bliz has changed a few pets selection of breed patterns in 6.0 and beyond. Can anyone confirm if P/P Kun-Lai Runts still appear? I've, for the last week, every single day, searched for it, and I've seen every other breed except P/P.

I'll take a grey little guy at this point!<br /><br />Edit: I have not done any of Pandaria on any of my toons, but some guildies whom have not done it have found him on their toons, so I'm not sure quest-instancing is an issue?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>captainfaptastic</b></h3>As of 7.2 the spawn rate of these might be dependent on the server time. I spent 2 hours last night flying laps in the area between shado-pan monastery, winter's blossom, and the peak of serenity. I didn't see one runt in that entire time despite killing every critter I could see. I logged in at lunch time today and couldn't stop stumbling over them, mainly on the mountain roads.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>knewal</b></h3>OK this is getting ridiculous, i set my HS to The Lucky Traveller and do circles around the mountaint roads several times a day for about a month now maybe i'll will find one.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Carmada</b></h3>I spent about 2 and a half hours searching for this yesterday with no luck, circling around and killing every critter in sight (this was between 10 AM-12:30 PM server time). I had no luck finding it as a secondary, either.<br /><br />I went back just now at 3:40 AM server time and I'm losing my mind cause they're everywhere. I'm not sure if this is based on server times but I feel like it might be. But I'm not sure when exactly because of lack of consistency. These are the coordinates of where I found them, although I doubt they're much use since they were so much more abundant throughout all of the snowy mountain paths. Good luck!<br /><br /><ul><li>35, 56 (nex to Kafi)</li><li>36, 50</li><li>52, 46</li><li>55, 46</li><li>50, 53</li><li>33, 53</li></ul></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BloodElvesRule</b></h3>I don't know if anybody has commented on this yet, but they aren't on the list for the &quot;Pandaria Safari&quot; achievement. I'm wondering why that is. The only beast/critter that is named for &quot;K&quot; is the Kuitan Mongoose. I think it would only give you credit for the &quot;Pandaria Tamer&quot; achievement for taming a pet in Kun-Lai Summit. <br /><br />However, my draenei deathknight is a level 120 and I've quested out in Pandaria.<br /><br />So, if you are looking to get the Kun-Lai Runt and you're trying to get the &quot;Pandaria Tamer&quot; achievement, but you haven't found anything for Kun-Lai Summit yet, I found mine in Winter's Blossom. They're so cute. Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dormamo</b></h3>These pets are NOT rare. If you don't see any, try turning on/off warmode. I saw 0 in 10 minutes of flying around then turned off warmode and saw a bunch of them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kelleybean</b></h3>I was finding these everywhere, must've gone through 30 in an hour trying to find a rare. Then suddenly there were no more spawns, and the few I did see, when I got closer to them they disappeared before my eyes. It almost seems like some sort of phasing issue? But I hadn't done anything different when they started to disappear. I was not in war mode.</div>
