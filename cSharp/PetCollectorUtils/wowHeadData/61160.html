Higher health critters are generally better quality: 140 health for instance on a alpine hare might be \"poor\" quality, but 150 could be \"rare\". This is by no means a hard-fast rule; the stats on pets are balanced like they are on gear, if you get a bit more on one stat, you lose on another. Because of how stats are balanced, you may get a harvester with 270 health that is \"common\" but has low combat abilities, and another that has only 250 health, but is powerful, and fast. judging by its health alone can help decide to continue the fight or just put it out of its misery, but be warned you may kill a rare, based off merely its health. Only by capturing it and checking stats can you be sure. \n\nOne other thing to note though, when capturing wild beasties for your collection, you may only collect up to a total of 3 of any certain type (although bliz did allow more than this for the multiples from many characters, you cannot collect more beyond the limit of 3) so, make sure you have 2 or less when you challenge that hard to find beast.  (sadly, on the above hunting trip.. I had 3 in my stable when i found a 278 health harvester and was unable to capture him)\n\nI tame lots of wild beasties for my collection, and prefer only the rare ones for my stables. I keep a high level pet in my stable of 3 when I go hunting, and if I see that the quarry I'm trying to tame is lower health than the one I just tamed (for the same level of course) I just break out the big gun and put the smack down on it to save time (and win, allowing me to get those consecutive victory achievements at the same time). \n\nOne other thing to consider is that usually in zones beyond the newbie zones a critter you challenge will very likely get a (random zone specific critter) friend to help.. if the first critter is obviously not the quality you want, just nuke it and move on to his friend. its not guaranteed, but I've noticed that the 2nd critter is often \"uncommon\" or better in quality, so make your decision to capture the first or second creature quickly, because once you've captured the first one, you cannot capture his \"friend\" as well.","date":"2012-09-27T15:38:41-05:00","rating":3,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Get Pet Quality Notifier addon, it calculates if they're rare or not!","creationdate":"2012-10-09T22:02:42-05:00","id":582227,"rating":12,"commentid":1721829,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"CircleofHealing","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"Cannot find any rare ones, I have battled 30.","creationdate":"2012-10-11T07:26:15-05:00","id":582985,"rating":-3,"commentid":1721829,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"223389","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"Was in a bit of the same bind: I raised a full set of pets from level 2 to level 6 before seeing the first rare one, and only after I changed spot.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>elstohn</b></h3>The &quot;quality&quot; of pets can NOT be determined by the stats before you initiate combat, but it may be guessed when looking at its stats after you have challenged the critter. Higher health critters are generally better quality: 140 health for instance on a alpine hare might be &quot;poor&quot; quality, but 150 could be &quot;rare&quot;. This is by no means a hard-fast rule; the stats on pets are balanced like they are on gear, if you get a bit more on one stat, you lose on another. Because of how stats are balanced, you may get a harvester with 270 health that is &quot;common&quot; but has low combat abilities, and another that has only 250 health, but is powerful, and fast. judging by its health alone can help decide to continue the fight or just put it out of its misery, but be warned you may kill a rare, based off merely its health. Only by capturing it and checking stats can you be sure. <br /><br />One other thing to note though, when capturing wild beasties for your collection, you may only collect up to a total of 3 of any certain type (although bliz did allow more than this for the multiples from many characters, you cannot collect more beyond the limit of 3) so, make sure you have 2 or less when you challenge that hard to find beast. (sadly, on the above hunting trip.. I had 3 in my stable when i found a 278 health harvester and was unable to capture him)<br /><br />I tame lots of wild beasties for my collection, and prefer only the rare ones for my stables. I keep a high level pet in my stable of 3 when I go hunting, and if I see that the quarry I'm trying to tame is lower health than the one I just tamed (for the same level of course) I just break out the big gun and put the smack down on it to save time (and win, allowing me to get those consecutive victory achievements at the same time). <br /><br />One other thing to consider is that usually in zones beyond the newbie zones a critter you challenge will very likely get a (random zone specific critter) friend to help.. if the first critter is obviously not the quality you want, just nuke it and move on to his friend. its not guaranteed, but I've noticed that the 2nd critter is often &quot;uncommon&quot; or better in quality, so make your decision to capture the first or second creature quickly, because once you've captured the first one, you cannot capture his &quot;friend&quot; as well.</div>

Being a machanical it's going to king hit them with 50% extra damage.<br /><br />I've levelled mine up from 3 to current 17 and is on 1094 health. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=390">Demolish</a> a beast and is 592 damage, critical hit and it's around 900+.<br /><br />Edit: Three years later and he's been a level 25 for quite a while and been a mainstay in my team. Reliably &quot;Metal Fisting&quot; beasts to death across Azeroth.Upgraded my Menagerie today and it was a pleasure seeing my little &quot;Whirzzz&quot; walking around the garrison.<br /><br />Demolish is good when it connects (Rarely!), however he has delivered the knockout punch a couple of times at critical times which is a hoot!<br /><br />I love this little guy!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>795337</b></h3>there are 5 farms in Westfall and each one of them has a large quantity if these little fellas, about 10 or 12 each. They have a decent respawn rate. a few respawned while I was on my killing spree searching for a rare, others respawned while I was farm hopping. Also, I got a rare fairly quickly, after only about 15 encounter.<br />I recommend getting the add on Pet Theory, it won't tell you what quality the pet is before you start the fight but as soon as enter into battle it will clearly show the level of all pets in the encounter as well as how many you already have and the quality of them as well. I have found this a real time saver, I don't have try to guess if it's a rare by it's level of health and I don't have to finish a battle only to find out it's a common.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maricah</b></h3>Easy pie to get, rares aren't that hard either, but flying around can be a little time consuming.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nekrotik</b></h3><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=390#comments">Demolish</a> hits very hard IF it hits, but it's not at all uncommon for it to miss as many as 6 or 7 times in a row, even on beasts. Best used when your pet still has plenty of health.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cyllocke</b></h3>Found around the farms in Westfall. I battled about a dozen of them before I got a rare, they respawn pretty fast. This little guy packs a decent punch, especially against beasts. Like all mechanical units, if killed he will 'resurrect' once with a small amount of health (about 20%), usually enough for another attack or two. And no, after the latest patch you can't determine pet rarity before you initiate battle. However, it will show on your screen right at the beginning. So you could start battle and, if the pet you've found isn't a rare, forfeit it - so long as you don't mind the 10% penalty on your pets' health.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vandrir</b></h3>I went 64-0 before reading the comments here. After I read them I went to the Jansen's Stead and within 5 battles I had a rare. The comments show that almost everyone captured their rare at either the Jansen Stead or Furlbrow's Pumpkin farm. Hope it helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1145583</b></h3>The first one I found was a rare. At Alexston Farmstead (39.40, 53.03). Used a Darkshore Cub (rare), easy to catch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vetis</b></h3>When you are leveling a group of pets for the first time, you want two things: Mechanical attacks and Beast attacks. This guy is a really awesome pet and carried my team to 25! Reason for wanting mechanical and beast attacks is there are an absolute ton of beasts and critters for you to level on, and mechanical is strong against beasts while beasts are strong against critters. Your third choice does not matter as much, but those two do.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>703340</b></h3>The Power/Power variety for this pet is a lie. It just does not exist.<br /><br />I was out in the fields looking for it for hours, nothing.</div>
