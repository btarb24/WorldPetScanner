Ahead of it is [npc=51600] and [npc=63370]. Red Cricket only has slightly more health (+41), 13 more power, but 27 less speed. Lil' Ragnaros, like Lil' Deathwing, has more health (+244), higher power (+16), but equally less speed (-65).\r\n\r\nIt serves its purpose well though amongst high power pets: Lil' Ragnaros fills the Elemental chair. Red Cricket fills the Critter chair. Lil' Deathwing is Dragonkin. Further down the power table are a number of Beasts, a few Humanoids, more Dragonkins, and an Aquatic. In fact, the next Magic pet ([npc=66984]) has 36 less power. The next easily obtainable Magic pet ([npc=67332]) has 52 less power.\r\n\r\nMini Diablo has a wide variety of abilities that cover a myriad of angles, from elemental damage (strong vs mechanical), to humanoid (strong vs dragonkin), to magic (strong vs flying), to undead (strong vs humanoid).\r\n\r\n[petability=113] is a heavy hitter, strong versus mechanical, weak versus critters. It is preferable to [petability=472] when the user's speed is faster than the opponent's. This is often the case when [petability=471] is used.\r\n\r\nTo compensate for Mini Diablo's low health, a number of control abilities can be used. [petability=471] reduces the damage from the opponent and slows them down, allowing you to hit first, potentially killing them before they get another hit in, or using [petability=256] before they can heal. Call Darkness is a strong ability, although its strength against Dragonkin is a bit of a misnomer, given that Magic pets themselves take 50% more damage from Dragonkin. This increased damage is lessened by Magic pet's innate ability: they cannot be dealt more than 35% of their maximum health in one attack. Some dragonkin operate on heavy hits, which also have low hit chances ([petability=612], [petability=169]). Call Darkness will help them miss further, and [petability=471] will help reduce damage further.\r\n\r\nMini Diablo is a strong choice versus aquatic pets, taking 33% less damage from aquatic attacks, although two of its abilities ([petability=468], [petability=650]) are weak versus them.\r\n\r\nWith the right selection of abilities and knowing your opponent's moves, you can be triumphant with Mini Diablo, making for a quick battle due to its exceedingly hard hitting abilities.","date":"2013-10-24T11:03:38-05:00","rating":9,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":16,"id":2103528,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"DavalPrestor","body":"\"Who's the little fear demon?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>74218</b></h3>Actually, when I first saw this my mind went all loopy. I had just finished playing Diablo 2 and had defeated Diablo in hell mode a couple of times; not an easy task as some players might remember. Lo and behold I go over to my friend's house and begin to play World of Warcraft for the first time. He had the original game so I, of course, choose Diablo as my pet of choice. So, I choose him and expect the snowy area around me to erupt in flames with the screen shaking sporadically, while all hell is sent loose and I face demons with over 100% resistance to every spell and molten lava engulfs me within a 20 foot radius. After the extreme adrenaline rush I look down and see what seems to be a mini Diablo, with the unmistakable title of Lord of Terror. I believe at that point I began to scream out of sheer confusion.</div>

The summon items are Account Bound, and do not vanish when you learn the summon spell.<br /><br />I've tested and my warrior now has a Panda, a Zergling and a Mini Diablo on him.<br /><br />I then proceeded to mail all three summon items to an alt, and was able to teach her all three summons.<br /><br />Really cool.</div>
