There are usually 3 Battle Rats in Strahnbrad, so battle them since the Hare can spawn as a secondary, as the way to get rid of them. While you're hunting for the rare Hare, you should check on the Rats to make sure they aren't taking up the BP spots in the area. Battle 2 if you see that they have spawned. There's one in the orchard (looks like an orchard), another by the fountain and the third is along the \"street\" on the edge of that area.\n\nFly through Crushridge and beyond as shown on the map where the Hare spawns. I find that they mostly spawn along that area of Crushridge. You can ignore spawn spot 53, 23 since it's bugged, but you might be able to kill it with AoE. I was using my hunter so the traps didn't exactly work (my hunter helped since I can see the Hares on the mini-map as yellow dots).\n\nYou don't necessarily have to kill the non-BP Hares, but you can if you feel better about it. After I battled the Rats, there was already a Battle Hare in Crushridge waiting for me to get. The Hares will spawn\/despawn after a while, even the BP one. After I had gotten my rare Hare, another Battle Hare spawned just beside me. I didn't touch it and it despawned after a while.\n\nHope that helps you all. Good luck with your hunting.\n\nSuggestion: Get the Master Riding skill. It helps.\n\nEdit: Even if my assumption isn't correct, you're still freeing up 3 BP spots (in Strahnbrad) for the entire zone anyways.","date":"2012-11-19T08:30:19-06:00","rating":14,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Read my full comment below that elaborates on this post.

However, it disappeared when I got close.\n\nA few more rounds around the mountains later I am convinced that the whole mystery of the spawning of this pet is just that there are actually more than 1 phase of the snowy area.\n\nDuring the few rounds I have noticed hares disappearing in front of me, or spots with critter hares becoming empty on my next cycle through the spot.\n\nThen I found another BP hare (which is a rare), then another spawned at the same spot, and a 3rd one after that. After battling the 3 pets I went to where the rats were and it was empty.\n\nThe next flight through there shows 1 BP rats with 2 critter rats, a few critter hares and then 2 BP rats + 1 critter rats and stayed that way.\n\nSo here is my theory, there are in total 3 regular BPs within the snow mountains for both hares and rats, however, since some of the BP hares could be in a different phase you may not be able to see them (which is why there are only 2 BP rats up atm). So when I first killed off the 3 rats, a BP hare spawned, but in a different phase which means it despawned right in front of me. When I kill off the 2 rats after that, 2 BP hares spawned, in the right phase, then another spawned at the same spot. After that, 2 BP rats spawned, together with the BP hare in the other phase, there are now 3 BP pets up and no more of them would spawn.\n\nTo make matters worse, the hares do wander for a bit around their spawn points, and at some points they get transited to another phase, which would explain why they keep appearing and disappearing so randomly.\n\nTherefore, my advice on camping this pet would be similiar to Korleth's: first to circle around the mountain and getting rid of all the (3) BPs, do that until you can no longer see any BPs within the area, then take your time battling BPs in the other areas and check back regularly to clear any rat spawns and hope that one of the BP hares would wander far enough to exit into your phase.\n\nRegarding killing other BPs in the zone to free up spots, I personally support the theory, as explained in my post at [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=62246#comments:id=1767912]Shimmershell Snail[\/url], it just function differently from the 3 regular BPs within the snow mountains (count them as extras, and the reason why there can be a lot more of pets occupying the spots right after server restarts than you can usually find).","date":"2012-11-26T11:18:33-06:00","rating":-3,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2012-11-26T11:25:53-06:00",3,"verduran"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":25,"id":1768832,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"1058762","body":"i got lucky with my first try- 428 hp and as second of a rat. at Coords 56\/25.\r\nhappy hunting!","date":"2012-11-27T15:00:11-06:00","rating":-4,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Thanks, I also found one round about there, second to a rat","creationdate":"2012-12-01T10:54:48-06:00","id":605968,"rating":0,"commentid":1768832,"dataTree":1,"roles":256,"username":"Dogmeatman","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":26,"id":1773453,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"AkaraBWR","body":"Not sure if coincidence or not, but since 5.1 I've noticed a few more in the snowy area.\r\n\r\nWhen I got mine, I couldn't find a single one until I took the advice of searching for one as a secondary.

They behave in a way unlike any other battle pet I've tried to capture so far.\r\n\r\nIt seems that when they spawn in the snowy area (Slaughter Hollow), they stick around for only a very short period of time before they despawn.  I tested this several times with several different hares, and the same thing happened every time.\r\n\r\nHere's what happened:\r\n\r\nI was flying over - noticed a snowshoe hare.  Flew down and engaged, but it was a poor quality, and I already have an uncommon.  I abandoned, then started looking to see if any of my friends online needed one.  During that brief time, the pet vanished.  \r\n\r\nSurprised, I flew around a bit and spotted another - this one was uncommon.  When I abandoned this time, I kept it targeted and just watched.  After a short period of time, it vanished as well.  \r\n\r\nI flew around, hovering over different spawn spots... and noted the same thing again and again.  I'd spot a hare, engage it, and it would vanish seconds after I abandoned. Sometimes - but not always! - they would reappear.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I noticed was that the quality of the hares kept changing...  some were poor, some common, a couple uncommon.  The secondary pets were also changing (one had a rare rat, for example, never saw that one again - even though I abandoned it).  \r\n\r\nEventually I decided to just sit at one of the spawn spots after it disappeared and see what happened.  A little bit later, a critter version of the hare appeared.  It too disappeared - then reappeared, then disappeared.  \r\n\r\nWhile I was watching it, another battle pet popped up at a nearby spawn - it happened to be a rare, so I tamed it (while holding my breath, since I knew I probably couldn't abandon and catch the same one again before it vanished on me).  That same spot respawned as a critter seconds later.  \r\n\r\nI went back to the spot I had been watching previously and killed the critter, out of curiosity.  It respawned immediately - killed it again...  it continued to respawn as a critter.  The spot where I'd tamed the rare eventually respawned as a poor quality hare - I abandoned, watched it disappear and respawn as a critter.  While I was sitting here typing this (I play in windowed mode), that one disappeared and another battle pet appeared where I'd been killing the critter.  This happened twice more - critter to battle pet to critter - while I watched.\r\n\r\n[b]TL;DR: The Snowshoe Hare battle pet shares a spawn with the critter version of the Snowshoe hare in the snow covered region of Slaughter Hollow.  They do not stay up for very long, though (as critter or battle pet) - they disappear within less than a minute of spawning.  \r\n\r\nIf you want to try to get one of these, I suggest camping at coordinates 50, 21, or at another area where you can see multiple spawn points without moving.\r\n\r\nSit, and be vewy, vewy quiet... it's the only way to hunt wabbits.[\/b]","date":"2013-10-15T14:57:43-05:00","rating":15,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":51,"id":1909506,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Pinkpaw","body":"Theese are indeed very tricky.

I spent 3 hours working this one out and got to the point where I knew what would happen next dependant on my actions.\r\n\r\nThe Snowshoe Hare is unique in the way it spawns and acts so I have this list of rules you can go through to understand as to what will spawn next as a battle pet in Alterac Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe first rule is only 3 active Battle Pets may be up or queued to spawn at any one time in the Alterac Mountain area, this includes Strahnbrad.\r\n\r\nThe Second rule is a pet may not respawn in the same location within a short time after it has been killed (maybe 5 min).\r\n\r\nThe third rule is Shoeshoe Hares can spawn as a Battle Pet or a Critter and once spawned will despawn within 1 minute.\r\n\r\nSo what does this mean? Well if you leave the zone and kill or battle nothing, because all the Snowshoe Hares will despawn they will eventually spawn as the 3 rats in Strahnbrad.  This scenario is what I considered a clean or reset zone.  So when I fly in the first thing I do is go to Strahnbrad and kill the 3 rats, by battle or whatever. As soon as this happens Snowshoe hares will begin to spawn as combat and non-combat pets and will only stay up for a minute or so before despawning.  So fly around the zone in circles and you will start to see them.  I recommend killing the non-combat ones to keep the spawns rolling. When you notice the spawn rate slowing go back to Strahnbrad as there will be rats up again, kill them and go back to do circles.\r\n\r\nTo do circles I actually flew up and down from 47.20 to 53.25 and back a few times as there were so many spawns there and once there was nothing to kill I would do a full loop around.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps, I have tested this method over and over and do not consider this a difficult pet to tame as a rare once you understand fully the mechanics of the zone.","date":"2014-01-07T01:59:10-06:00","rating":785,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"I can attest this is correct.

I bandaged everything & all my pets were lvl25. I had a Anubisan Idol, Young Flayerling &!... Terrible Turnip.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>746772</b></h3>This one was hard for me to find. The description suggests he would be found in the snowy areas but there are no battle pets there. I found none in the large grassy areas of Hillsbrad, not even as the second pet. My husband said he found his in The Uplands, behind the Ruins of Alterac as a second pet. I didn't find one there but made a circle around the Ruins until I finally got on in Strahnbrad. It was the second pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>706720</b></h3>I fount the hare by tracking down all bp's around Ruins Of Alterac in Hillsbrad Foothills.<br /><br />It is found as a 2. battle pet. <br /><br />Took about 10-15 mins to find it, so take a pet with u that u want to lvl together with a high lvl pet who can deal with the pain when you are trying to capture the hare. (It did miss once and nerly lost a battle pet same lvl as the hare) <br /><br />Good Luck with the hunt, hope it helped.<br /><br />Cheers!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>I did manage to find one of these as a battle pet in the snowy area. They *do* exist, but quite frankly, the rarity of finding them doesn't make it worthwhile. If you are looking for one of these, take the suggestions above and farm other groups in the general area, and eventually one will show up as a second pet in the battle for you to catch. <br /><br />Rather like the larva, these *do* exist, but it's not worth the headache to try and find it. ;)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hogri</b></h3>I saw one on my minimap today in a snowy area near Strahnbrad (53/23) but when I flew to the exact spot it was on the map, there was no hare. I tried targetting it and only got a non-tamable one. When I flew towards that one it disappeared and so did the tamable one I saw on the minimap and I haven't seen them since, so I guess it could be some phasing bug or maybe it's a cross server zone and someone else tamed it (I saw no one and /who said I was alone in the area)...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Emmerald</b></h3>Found one as a secondary opponent on second try in the hills near the &quot;snowcapped&quot; area. Didn't get a single one when near the sea.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>javawife</b></h3>I found several as the 2nd pet in the Dalaran crater part of Hillsbrad. The 1st pet was usually a Rat -- and I got 3 rare rats in the process. Still waiting for the rare snowshoe hare to drop though. But several uncommons dropped.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>130234</b></h3>There are 3-4 spawn points for the Snowshoe Hare due west of Strahnbrad near the Crushridge Ogres. On my first fly through of the area I didn't spot any that I could interact with. Decided to /target Snowshoe and kill any that weren't battle pets which worked out. After circling the Ruins of Alterac and coming back to the northern edge of the ruins 3 of the Snowshoe Hares had respawned as battle pets, so make sure you are cycling those spawns til you see one. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1036751</b></h3>Found one as a secondary pet while fighting rats around Dalaran crater as others have said.<br />Quite lucky my first was a rare too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Siknevl</b></h3>Found an actual Snowshoe hare capturable at Crushridge Hold next to a tree at the coords of (51,22). It was grey quality.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>smilez1999</b></h3>They are finally here! I just visited Hillsbrad, and the first things I saw were two rats. Neither had a hare. I circled around the snowy area, and, lo and behold, there was a Snowshoe Hare hopping around! I got lucky and it was Uncommon quality. It was the only one I had seen, but when I came out of battle, I saw another one hopping nearby. In case it matters, this was in Crushridge Hold. Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dragomir</b></h3>Found a rare one as a secondary from Infested Bear Cub. Nice surprise.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>diettoxin</b></h3>I found this pet as a secondary to a normal rabbit just north of Strahnbrad and it took a few times to get it. Didnt find any in the snow area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ladybetty</b></h3>After searching the Ruins of Alterac several times over a period of days and never finding one of these Hares, I did what some other comments suggested and tried finding one as a secondary pet in antoher battle. After clearing out all the pets near the Dalaran Crater and still not finding one, I head over towards the Uplands and was surprised to see several Hares had spawned in the few minutes I was away battling other pets. <br /><br />Perhaps clearing some of the surrounding area opens up some spawns that can be filled by Hares.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Katstorm</b></h3>I found a few as secondary pets to Rabbits around the Tarren Mill area, specifically between Tarren Mill and South Shore. The one I caught (I killed the first one by accident) happened to be a rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dawnshadow</b></h3>I found one (and only one) as a primary pet at 41.1, 27.5. This is still in the snowy Ruins of Alterac, but outside the wall, near a lot of Giant Yetis. This was on my second check of the area, so it had only spawned recently.<br /><br />This was after trying and failing to find it as a secondary in quite a few other battles against rats and rabbits. It's possible that despawning the other critters allowed this one to spawn. so you may wish to try this if you're having trouble.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BubuKitty00</b></h3>For all the rare hunters, I got a rare snowshoe hare as a secondary to a rabbit along the river behind Tarren Mill. Snowshoe hares also appear as secondaries to toads.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Korleth</b></h3>How To: Ruins of Alterac is a zone by itself meaning (and this is an assumption but it seems to be right) the battle pet population only covers this area when dealing with the BP's in RoAlterac. There are usually 3 Battle Rats in Strahnbrad, so battle them since the Hare can spawn as a secondary, as the way to get rid of them. While you're hunting for the rare Hare, you should check on the Rats to make sure they aren't taking up the BP spots in the area. Battle 2 if you see that they have spawned. There's one in the orchard (looks like an orchard), another by the fountain and the third is along the &quot;street&quot; on the edge of that area.<br /><br />Fly through Crushridge and beyond as shown on the map where the Hare spawns. I find that they mostly spawn along that area of Crushridge. You can ignore spawn spot 53, 23 since it's bugged, but you might be able to kill it with AoE. I was using my hunter so the traps didn't exactly work (my hunter helped since I can see the Hares on the mini-map as yellow dots).<br /><br />You don't necessarily have to kill the non-BP Hares, but you can if you feel better about it. After I battled the Rats, there was already a Battle Hare in Crushridge waiting for me to get. The Hares will spawn/despawn after a while, even the BP one. After I had gotten my rare Hare, another Battle Hare spawned just beside me. I didn't touch it and it despawned after a while.<br /><br />Hope that helps you all. Good luck with your hunting.<br /><br />Suggestion: Get the Master Riding skill. It helps.<br /><br />Edit: Even if my assumption isn't correct, you're still freeing up 3 BP spots (in Strahnbrad) for the entire zone anyways.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jeolene</b></h3>I can confirm that the hare does not just spawn up in the mountain area, I have found one as an addon pet while I was out looking for infected bear cubs and starting a battle with a Rabbit down by Azurelode mine. I'm submitting a screenshot, not sure how long it takes to be accepted, but hope this helps people :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xantshmeshnilnon</b></h3>It seems that Snowshoe Hare appears as a secondary pet for almost every battle pet found in Hillsbrad Foothills. The best place to farm them is the Azurelode Mine full of spiders. There are no aggressive mobs around and huge amount of battle spiders pets. On the other hand uneven surface might be a bit annoying to start pet battle in some cases.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1051537</b></h3>I found a set of battle Snowshoe Hares - two of them in the same battle in the snowy area. One was poor and the other was uncommon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1057963</b></h3>i found a snowshoe hare 2nd to a rabbit near the dalaran crater i had read that they are 2nd t the rats there but after looking and fighting rats for an hour no more spawned so i was about to give up seen a rabit and there it was</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>verduran</b></h3>Adding to Korleth's comment, after spending 2 hours camping the place and finally gotten 2 spawns as secondary and 1 primary spawn (got an uncommon out of them), I came back trying to go after a rare this time.<br /><br />After doing a few rounds killing the BP rats and critter hares, I finally found a BP hare with my targeting macro. However, it disappeared when I got close.<br /><br />A few more rounds around the mountains later I am convinced that the whole mystery of the spawning of this pet is just that there are actually more than 1 phase of the snowy area.<br /><br />During the few rounds I have noticed hares disappearing in front of me, or spots with critter hares becoming empty on my next cycle through the spot.<br /><br />Then I found another BP hare (which is a rare), then another spawned at the same spot, and a 3rd one after that. After battling the 3 pets I went to where the rats were and it was empty.<br /><br />The next flight through there shows 1 BP rats with 2 critter rats, a few critter hares and then 2 BP rats + 1 critter rats and stayed that way.<br /><br />So here is my theory, there are in total 3 regular BPs within the snow mountains for both hares and rats, however, since some of the BP hares could be in a different phase you may not be able to see them (which is why there are only 2 BP rats up atm). So when I first killed off the 3 rats, a BP hare spawned, but in a different phase which means it despawned right in front of me. When I kill off the 2 rats after that, 2 BP hares spawned, in the right phase, then another spawned at the same spot. After that, 2 BP rats spawned, together with the BP hare in the other phase, there are now 3 BP pets up and no more of them would spawn.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the hares do wander for a bit around their spawn points, and at some points they get transited to another phase, which would explain why they keep appearing and disappearing so randomly.<br /><br />Therefore, my advice on camping this pet would be similiar to Korleth's: first to circle around the mountain and getting rid of all the (3) BPs, do that until you can no longer see any BPs within the area, then take your time battling BPs in the other areas and check back regularly to clear any rat spawns and hope that one of the BP hares would wander far enough to exit into your phase.<br /><br />Regarding killing other BPs in the zone to free up spots, I personally support the theory, as explained in my post at <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62246#comments:id=1767912">Shimmershell Snail</a>, it just function differently from the 3 regular BPs within the snow mountains (count them as extras, and the reason why there can be a lot more of pets occupying the spots right after server restarts than you can usually find).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AkaraBWR</b></h3>Not sure if coincidence or not, but since 5.1 I've noticed a few more in the snowy area.<br /><br />When I got mine, I couldn't find a single one until I took the advice of searching for one as a secondary. Today, my boyfriend mentioned that he needed his Hare and I helped him look around. After a few searches for a secondary with no luck, I checked the Ruins of Alterac and found at least 3-4 as primary pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sospitatrix</b></h3>After a lot of hard-to-find pets i hoped to find a rather easy one with this. I thought the area would be infested with little hares, but no... I found only one, a poor one, but just to be safe I caught it anyway. And I was glad I did! Didn't find another one there after that one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tethic</b></h3>The Dalaran Crater is usually being camped, so keep in mind the areas designated on the map actually have Snowshoe Hares but you have to find them as main animals.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mcomommy</b></h3>After reading the posts regarding this pet showing up as a secondary, I spent 2 hours circling the crater and never once saw it show up to aid a rat or libram. I decided to add the snowy area into my 'rat check' flight and while rare, a couple of hares did show up at the locations on the map. Determined to get this creature before I went to bed - it was the last rare catch I needed to finish off the zone - I stayed up past midnight. As noted on a few other rare spawn battle pet pages, this pet has a sweet spot where it spawns prolifically for a very short amount of time. At approximately 12:15 am (I say approximately because I was in the middle of my second pet battle when I realized what was happening and only then looked at the clock) every spawn point noted on the map above spawned a hare. As I was the only one in the zone, I was able to battle my way through them finding 2 poor, a handful of commons, 2 uncommon and 1 rare. I stayed until 12:25 when non-battle critter hares started spawning back in place of the battle pet version. I hope this information helps someone else in their search for this pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zulaar1</b></h3>Crushridge Hold can be confirmed as a spawning spot, near the actual Ogre cave. Got two spawns at once, but it seems like a rare event.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cUnAzeroth</b></h3>I concentrated my effort in and around Strahnbrad. It seems that there are 3 battle pets in this area (usually rats) and on my 4th attempt at battling these 3 rats I got my rare Snowshoe Hare as a secondary. And contrary to what some have said there are Snowshoe Hares in and around the snowy regions of the Ruins of Alterac as primary battle pets but they are a VERY rare spawn. (Sometimes you can use a target macro (/tar Snowshoe Hare) to see them because they really do blend in with the snow.) Better to use your time farming them as a secondary battle pet and hope you get lucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>694270</b></h3>Spent about an hour yesterday looking for one of these, cleared Dalaran Crater of critters trying to find one as a secondary, Battle, forfeit, over and over and over... Did the same thing today since there were no battle pet Snowshoe hares, killed all the non battle ones (a few phased out when I walked up to them.) and cleared the entire crater again with no luck, flew back over the snowy area and finally found one... A rare thankfully. So no luck with getting one as a secondary for me...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Doaix</b></h3>Confirmed that this can spawn as a secondary to the spiders in the Azurelode Mine (as well as the Infested Bear Cubs near the mine). If nobody has gone through to clear the mine of pets lately, this might be a good place to hit up when farming for a Rare or specific breed. However, it is not 100% chance to be the secondary, so unless you see the mine is packed with battle pet spiders when on the surface, it might not be worth your time to make a pass through it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Draewind</b></h3>Got my uncommon S/B on my first Hillbrad battle. Wanted to check for an upgrade on a Red-Tailed Squirrel. Engaged one just south of Durnhold Keep ... the secondary was this Uncommon Snowshoe Hare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Orchis</b></h3>I found one of these in a very unlikely place. I was doing archaeology at the Southshore dig site. Out of boredom I decided to battle a plain, generic Toad that was in water not far from the mouth of the river. The second battle pet was a Snowshoe Hare and it was a rare. I spent hours around the crater and at Strahnbrad and couldn't get better than a common quality.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MilaPriest</b></h3>I found an uncommon hare at &quot;Chillwind Point&quot; in Hillsbrad. I have to admit that it was totally coincidence, after camping for long time around Ruins of Alterac, I wanted to try my luck w a random &quot;Rabbit&quot; around &quot;Chillwind Point&quot;, 2nd pet was snowshoe hare. I don't think this is a good strategy but better than waiting/camping for nothing I guess. Good luck all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bloodywloc</b></h3>Basically as I see it the most easiest way to grab this pet is to go around a snowy area and kill all the untamable critters and in time the tamable hares will start spamming I got it like that.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>722566</b></h3>There are snowshoe hares in the snow part of Alterac... very rare only seen one and it happened to be snowing at the time idk if that had anything to do with it ...BUT!... it WAS there</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Morniel</b></h3>So... these little guys are tricky. They behave in a way unlike any other battle pet I've tried to capture so far.<br /><br />It seems that when they spawn in the snowy area (Slaughter Hollow), they stick around for only a very short period of time before they despawn. I tested this several times with several different hares, and the same thing happened every time.<br /><br />Here's what happened:<br /><br />I was flying over - noticed a snowshoe hare. Flew down and engaged, but it was a poor quality, and I already have an uncommon. I abandoned, then started looking to see if any of my friends online needed one. During that brief time, the pet vanished. <br /><br />Surprised, I flew around a bit and spotted another - this one was uncommon. When I abandoned this time, I kept it targeted and just watched. After a short period of time, it vanished as well. <br /><br />I flew around, hovering over different spawn spots... and noted the same thing again and again. I'd spot a hare, engage it, and it would vanish seconds after I abandoned. Sometimes - but not always! - they would reappear.<br /><br />Another thing I noticed was that the quality of the hares kept changing... some were poor, some common, a couple uncommon. The secondary pets were also changing (one had a rare rat, for example, never saw that one again - even though I abandoned it). <br /><br />Eventually I decided to just sit at one of the spawn spots after it disappeared and see what happened. A little bit later, a critter version of the hare appeared. It too disappeared - then reappeared, then disappeared. <br /><br />While I was watching it, another battle pet popped up at a nearby spawn - it happened to be a rare, so I tamed it (while holding my breath, since I knew I probably couldn't abandon and catch the same one again before it vanished on me). That same spot respawned as a critter seconds later. <br /><br />I went back to the spot I had been watching previously and killed the critter, out of curiosity. It respawned immediately - killed it again... it continued to respawn as a critter. The spot where I'd tamed the rare eventually respawned as a poor quality hare - I abandoned, watched it disappear and respawn as a critter. While I was sitting here typing this (I play in windowed mode), that one disappeared and another battle pet appeared where I'd been killing the critter. This happened twice more - critter to battle pet to critter - while I watched.<br /><br /><b>TL;DR: The Snowshoe Hare battle pet shares a spawn with the critter version of the Snowshoe hare in the snow covered region of Slaughter Hollow. They do not stay up for very long, though (as critter or battle pet) - they disappear within less than a minute of spawning. <br /><br />If you want to try to get one of these, I suggest camping at coordinates 50, 21, or at another area where you can see multiple spawn points without moving.<br /><br />Sit, and be vewy, vewy quiet... it's the only way to hunt wabbits.</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pinkpaw</b></h3>Theese are indeed very tricky. But stop looking in the snowy part of Ruins of Alterac, you will be there for days. Instead turn your gaze to the rats of strahnbrad, the bunny appears as a second battler whit the rats. Might save you alot of time :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1194987</b></h3>Confirmed</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wipebringer</b></h3>I have captured just about every pet in the game as rare so I believe I have a pretty good knowledge of capturing pets. I spent 3 hours working this one out and got to the point where I knew what would happen next dependant on my actions.<br /><br />The Snowshoe Hare is unique in the way it spawns and acts so I have this list of rules you can go through to understand as to what will spawn next as a battle pet in Alterac Mountains.<br /><br />The first rule is only 3 active Battle Pets may be up or queued to spawn at any one time in the Alterac Mountain area, this includes Strahnbrad.<br /><br />The Second rule is a pet may not respawn in the same location within a short time after it has been killed (maybe 5 min).<br /><br />The third rule is Shoeshoe Hares can spawn as a Battle Pet or a Critter and once spawned will despawn within 1 minute.<br /><br />So what does this mean? Well if you leave the zone and kill or battle nothing, because all the Snowshoe Hares will despawn they will eventually spawn as the 3 rats in Strahnbrad. This scenario is what I considered a clean or reset zone. So when I fly in the first thing I do is go to Strahnbrad and kill the 3 rats, by battle or whatever. As soon as this happens Snowshoe hares will begin to spawn as combat and non-combat pets and will only stay up for a minute or so before despawning. So fly around the zone in circles and you will start to see them. I recommend killing the non-combat ones to keep the spawns rolling. When you notice the spawn rate slowing go back to Strahnbrad as there will be rats up again, kill them and go back to do circles.<br /><br />To do circles I actually flew up and down from 47.20 to 53.25 and back a few times as there were so many spawns there and once there was nothing to kill I would do a full loop around.<br /><br />I hope this helps, I have tested this method over and over and do not consider this a difficult pet to tame as a rare once you understand fully the mechanics of the zone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shyenne</b></h3>I must have been farming this hare for about a month now. For some reason I could not find it for nothing. Finally decided to try for the Black Tabby and upgrade a few pets, found a Rare Hare as a second to an Infested Cub. So my advise would be to check rhose as well if you are missing him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hawkeye5723</b></h3>I wild angry beyond belief.. After spending Hrs &amp; Days &amp; WEEKS flying circles around 'Ruins of Alterac', very rarely getting a battleable Hare, &amp; when I do it is Grey, White or the occasional Green, as well doing the few 'Infested Bear Cub's when they are up.. My jaw hit the floor this morning when I got a lvl6 BLUE Hare as a secondary to a Bear.... I back out of the fight as I had no despawn time restrictions like in the Ruins.. I bandaged everything &amp; all my pets were lvl25. I had a Anubisan Idol, Young Flayerling &amp;!... Terrible Turnip. Ideal set up as can handle Any level captures cos the Turnip won't kill it, used it lots before &amp; worked great, just drop it if need be to 1. All going well, I kill the Bear, the Hare comes in, I swap to the Turnip &amp;....... &quot;Weakening Blow&quot; tooltip is wrong!.. it doesn't have &quot;Cannot reduce opponent to lower than 1 health&quot;.. CRAP... they are all lvl25, Turnips battle skills have screwed up &amp; bear is dead.. so if I back out I Loose the Hare. so I use it once, weak hit &amp; the Hare drops from 300+ to 200 something.. If I can do that again, or just the tooltip that is screwed, I HOPEFULLY will be ok.. No Such Luck.. it kills the Hare, Battle ends &amp; I check the turnip &amp; the the tooltip is back to normal! Now I have no Rare Hare,back to wasting Hrs &amp; Days of my life again that I will never get back. : #<br /><br />UPDATE: I can't bloody believe it.. 7 odd hrs ago the above happened.. I decided to take a break so I didn't put a foot through the screen hehe, I came back, tried the respawned Bears.. Nothing, so started on the ruins &amp; on the 3rd circuit.. I got a Blue Rare, was primary pet obviously.. &amp; this time the Turnip worked fine &amp; I am now the owner of a Rare Hare :D can't believe 2 in 1 day, at least has made up for earlier..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>B4mbi</b></h3>Maybe i had luck or they changed it, but today i wanted collect this pet after i noticed you can not buy from ah :)<br /> I flew 3 times in a circle above the ruins of alterac. I killed the first hare by accident. i wanted to tag it but my killer instict took over. After 5 minutes it spawned on different place but still in the ruins of alterac. So i am happy that i am having hare as dinner and also as a pet :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DCCXVIII</b></h3>Ignore the top rated comments, they don't work anymore. The way to get this now is to spam the wild pets around ancient Dalaran crater. It'll take about 10 to get a Snowshoe hare as a secondary pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Spilledstars</b></h3>If you're going to use the (rats there, snowshoe hares here, stay in the snows) method of hunting them up, I recommend killing any nonbattle critter of them you see, at least you'd get nose counts towards <a href="/achievement=5144/critter-kill-squad">Critter Kill Squad</a>. Also this is a seriously excellent place to farm herbs since <a href="/object=206085/frozen-herb">Frozen Herb</a> nodes happily refresh and stick to the area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Spilledstars</b></h3>There are lots of notes about the snowy sub-zone, but I think the overall zone has a max number of battlepets up at any time. When the zone is not populated with players very well, they'll all end up clumped somewhere else. Solution: go crazy battle-leveling your level 7'ish battle pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ocea</b></h3>As of 2024, this is still a pain. None spawned in the snowy area for me at all, I had to battle about 40-45 librams/rats in the crater area for a snowshoe hare to spawn as a secondary. Hopefully you have better luck, but be prepared for this to take awhile.</div>
