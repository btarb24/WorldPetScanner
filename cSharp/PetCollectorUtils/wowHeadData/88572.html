<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lahtinen</b></h3><ul><li>Day Three in Draenor: Talador.<br />I have set up camp near to the Tomb of Lights, near a Terokkar Refuge. Amongst my travels here I have found numerous lovely little beasts and critters amongst the flora and fauna! From a little <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=88355">Waterfly</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=83642">Mud Jumper</a>, to a rather beautiful sort of bird known as a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=88385">Bloodfeathe</a>r. The colours they possess are simply wonderful!<br /></li></ul><br /><ul><li>Day Four in Draenor: Talador.<br />I remain in my camp overlooking the body of water that I now have come to know as Duskfall Lake. Further studies of the local wildlife reveal more wonderful, and yet some dangerous, beasts - they include some <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=76668">Duskwings</a>, a sort of frog known as a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=78673">Riverhopper</a> and... wait... what is this?</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Evening Four in Draenor: Talador.<br />My goodness.There is a beautiful creature known as the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=79577">Riverwallower</a>! It has the grace of an <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=80997">Elekk</a>, but in the water! On land it does not seem to move as well at all. But that's not all! It has the CUTEST babies I have ever seen! I wonder if I can get close enough to take one of my own...</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Day Six in Draenor: Talador<br />Strange. It seems that the baby <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=79577">Riverwallower</a>, or &quot;<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=88572">Flat-Tooth Calf</a>&quot; as it is known, is very stubborn. It also seems that even when it's parents are not around, it refuses to leave the shorelines no matter how much I have tried to coax it so far. These specific <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=88983">Flat-Tooth Calves</a> does not even want to recognise my little team of minions, so that they cannot engage it and weaken it down into submission! I must try a different tactic...</li></ul><br /><ul><li>Evening Eight in Draenor: Talador<br />All other objectives on this weird alternative timeline... this world.... are secondary. The <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=88572">calf</a> MUST be mine at all costs. I am beginning to think this creature will be the death of me, especially when the huge <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=79577">Riverwallowers</a> are so close and in great numbers.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1344999</b></h3>Just found them out in large numbers @ 4PM server time (Laughing Skull). Time of day is definitely relevant, as I have never seen ANY let alone the 10+ i saw just now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Snowcho</b></h3>As soon as i landed at Terokkar refuge i head north and at 70.53 i found one (it was gray).Stormscale realm EU. Other 2 pets were Royal Moth and Mud Jumper.<br />Edit: Found second one at 64.62(this one was green) 14:28 realm time</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kishkon</b></h3>The LFG tool is pure gold for this type of pet.<br />Scouted the area on my server yet not pet in sight, joined some random raid, ported to a diff server and lo and behold there was a pet right next to my feet.<br /><br />Saved myself hours of camping and killing innocent critters, do yourself a favor and simply server jump.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>adorina</b></h3>Caught a poor quality one at 64.5, 62.3<br /><br />Northwest of Auchindoun.<br /><br />10:15 AM server time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AxeLond</b></h3>Found it in about 15 min at 19:22 CET (server time) <br /><br />I went a lapse around TWN and found nothing so I started jumping servers a bit with help of the premade finder. Took me about 4 min and I got a server and one spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nymie</b></h3>If they are not spawning around the island go to the lake that is southeast of Auchidon. I don't know if it is correlated, but none were spawned at the island area so I killed the non-battle pet guys (felt so guilty) then went to the Auchidon lake and there were at least a dozen around. It was around 4:30PM EST. I play on one of the highest pop servers in the US and it seemed others were also trying the kill method, I just got to the Auch lake first :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Borknagar</b></h3>Found nothing near <a href="/npc=76665/seer-malune">Seer Malune</a> (~65, 55), then I go to the south near <a href="/zone=6912/auchindoun">Auchindoun</a> (~58, 74) and found many spawns. Just for record, was 4am. I don't think that is time related spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>arawane</b></h3>Found one at 57.9,72.6 at 3:45am server time</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Swaney</b></h3>Their spawns DO seem to have a relation to the non-battle critter counterparts. There were no sightings what so ever when I first touched down. I went around the island, and down to auchindon both and killed off all the non-battle spawns of them I could spot. When I returned to the first area I cleared out, there was one that spawned ready to catch. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Alaurynn</b></h3>3:02 pm server time in the waters around Auchindoun, sunny weather, at least a dozen of these little guys were wandering around. I had no trouble finding a rare. Judging from the other comments, it would seem they are not dependent on a particular time of day. Just keep looking! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>106701</b></h3>I logged on immediately after reset and was met with an abundance of this pet. Get to bed early on Monday!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Volleynova</b></h3>Got mine at 12:45PM Server Time, at 65,64</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1406132</b></h3>Caught 23.27 server time on Turalyon EU at the lake around Auchindon. There was the Flat Tooth calf I caught and one other, mine was grey quality. I'd been camping him in both spots for a good four days and I was killing the non battle pet ones in the hope they would spawn, but nothing.<br />I do think it's just a slow spawn and you just need to be in the right place at the right time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sojumonkey</b></h3>Got a Rare on first find. I ran around the water killing all of them till one spawned that I could battle. <br /><br />56.6 79.6 was where I got mine. Seemed to be a higher concentration of them in smaller area, although less total than the other location to the north.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1061134</b></h3>Got mine (gray quality) merely by accidental walk-by 19:39 server time at 63.07 52.41<br />However, did not see other spawns anywhere nearby to hunt for a better quality.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Animegirl</b></h3>Seems to spawn more around auchindoun.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1449997</b></h3>found few on several alts..coords are 65.56</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>beckiesuedalton</b></h3>5:00 pm on Bronzebeard. Paying the Pet Karma forward!<br /><br />Four were up - three grey and two green with mixed quality Water Flies, Ash Spiderlings, and Kelp Scuttlers as secondary pets. I captured a green Calf and a grey Calf (for their mix of stats) then announced the spawns to General chat and left the other two Calf babies happily playing along the river's edge, secure in the knowledge that other Zookeepers would come along to give them good homes. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>angelsgrace</b></h3>I will be honest, after reading all those comments and having only just decided to go and search for this pet, I didn't have much hope in finding it. However, I found mine by Light's rest at 6:30pm server time. It was the only one up at the time though. Good luck everyone :):)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jaxcomet</b></h3>This is a really large pet compared to many others.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nyxtemplari</b></h3>Im not sure whether this was just luck, or Im on to something, but, noting that the tooltip mentioned arrowbloom, I chucked a couple of stacks of nagrand arrowbloom from my bank into my account, flew to exarches refuge and rode south. Encounted 2, both grey, around 58, 75. Given that this was only my second attempt to find one, I was either extremely lucky, or the arrowbloom attracts them. It was 3pm server time, so the time of day doesn't appear to be a factor.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Elenda</b></h3>The spawn rate of these has definitely been given a boost. If you gave up in your initial hunt but still wish to battle for a rare, give it a go now! There's always some around the water and, after doing a lap, some will have already respawned. Much easier.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pangolin</b></h3>Not sure if I'm lucky on this one but I just came across a bunch of them around the 55.00, 80.00 water point, like 4 of them in a single sight just waiting to be catched with the paw icon above them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>stingray1966</b></h3>I must have good luck i guess..first one i picked on south west side of island in Talador 63/53 ..Rare</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>maricam58</b></h3>2022 Pet battle:<br /><br />Just catching up on a few pet achievements before the next patch and I noticed I did not have a Rare quality Flat-Tooth Calf. I was beginning to despair of finding one but after an hour of battling in Talador I did finally locate and capture a rare at 67.87, 62.01, southwest of the Terrokar Refuge flight point.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BKMurmaider</b></h3>Here are the some of the TomTom coordinates from this thread.
