Not in the instance, but right outside, near the where new gnomes wake up. I found a couple on the airfield, but most of them I found downstairs.\n\nEdit 1: People have pointed out this is a horrible pet to farm if you only play Horde and have no Alliance toons. My advice is this: roll a new gnome like we were talking about earlier, run across the hallway, and battle those roaches to your heart's content. Since the pets are account-wide, it won't matter what level your new gnome is, your pets will still be the same. If you still haven't found the rare quality roach after you have cleared them all out, you can just log out and come back in an hour, because the respawn rate for this pet seems to be relatively low. This way your Horde toon doesn't have to worry about the level 95 guards outside, standing between them and their new roach. And the repair bills. Miles away from a Horde friendly NPC. And the level 1 gnome warlock who just woke up doesn't have a heart attack when they see a level 90 Tauren run past, away from the pack of gnomes chasing him.\n\nEdit 2: Don't forget to be on the lookout for your new [npc=68838]! I find them adorable, and the little guys were very hard for me to find!\n\nEdit 3: I'm noticing fewer of these whenever I'm around Gnomer these days. If you're having tough luck finding one, try a low pop server. Lots of people just like killing critters, and I watch people kill pets without a second thought. Unfortunately, where all these pets spawn is near a starting zone, so you might be having a problem with people killing them.\n\nIf you still can't get one to spawn, try battling other critters in the area. A lot of battle pet spawns are linked together, and frustratingly, unless you go and murder that grey rabbit, the rare roach will not spawn. A thoughtful commenter posted about killing the critters up on the ridge above. Obviously new gnomes can't do this, but it's a thought for Alliance with flying mounts.\n\nHope this helps!","date":"2012-09-28T15:38:25-05:00","rating":180,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Thanks for the head's up, I was flying around on the surface and they almost never seem to spawn there.","creationdate":"2012-10-05T23:20:14-05:00","id":579953,"rating":4,"commentid":1723264,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"MIMP","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"I found one inside and when I clicked to battle, it died o_O I also found a naked dead gnome on the lift so that might explain the lack of roaches for me.","creationdate":"2012-10-27T02:56:10-05:00","id":591519,"rating":2,"commentid":1723264,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"Voxi","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"Extremely long spawn timers, I had more luck outside in the Toxic Airfield with spawns, but as Ally, rotated back and forth between the above ground and below ground locations.","creationdate":"2012-10-29T08:53:18-05:00","id":592541,"rating":4,"commentid":1723264,"dataTree":1,"roles":256,"username":"Midgetpower","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"Tried this on multiple servers so far, can't battle any of the Irradiated Roaches down there.","creationdate":"2012-11-01T00:19:35-05:00","id":593674,"rating":9,"commentid":1723264,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"Aquamonkey","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"Thanks Midgetpower for your comment - as a pretty-much-Horde-only player, this gave me confidence that I'd be able to avoid Gnomer.

As many others have stated, these guys respawn in an unknown pattern. I found the most capturable spawns in the early morning and following restarts.\r\n\r\n2. Unlike the other pets I have encountered, these pets do not follow the linear pattern of \"the higher the health = the higher the quality\".

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>raistlyn</b></h3>Actually go down into Gnomer to find these little buggers (no pun intended). Not in the instance, but right outside, near the where new gnomes wake up. I found a couple on the airfield, but most of them I found downstairs.<br /><br />Edit 1: People have pointed out this is a horrible pet to farm if you only play Horde and have no Alliance toons. My advice is this: roll a new gnome like we were talking about earlier, run across the hallway, and battle those roaches to your heart's content. Since the pets are account-wide, it won't matter what level your new gnome is, your pets will still be the same. If you still haven't found the rare quality roach after you have cleared them all out, you can just log out and come back in an hour, because the respawn rate for this pet seems to be relatively low. This way your Horde toon doesn't have to worry about the level 95 guards outside, standing between them and their new roach. And the repair bills. Miles away from a Horde friendly NPC. And the level 1 gnome warlock who just woke up doesn't have a heart attack when they see a level 90 Tauren run past, away from the pack of gnomes chasing him.<br /><br />Edit 2: Don't forget to be on the lookout for your new <a href="/npc=68838/fluxfire-feline">Fluxfire Feline</a>! I find them adorable, and the little guys were very hard for me to find!<br /><br />Edit 3: I'm noticing fewer of these whenever I'm around Gnomer these days. If you're having tough luck finding one, try a low pop server. Lots of people just like killing critters, and I watch people kill pets without a second thought. Unfortunately, where all these pets spawn is near a starting zone, so you might be having a problem with people killing them.<br /><br />If you still can't get one to spawn, try battling other critters in the area. A lot of battle pet spawns are linked together, and frustratingly, unless you go and murder that grey rabbit, the rare roach will not spawn. A thoughtful commenter posted about killing the critters up on the ridge above. Obviously new gnomes can't do this, but it's a thought for Alliance with flying mounts.<br /><br />Hope this helps!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lahtinen</b></h3>Have fun trying to go down there without being killed by the level 95 <a href="/npc=42319/gnomeregan-infantry">Gnomeregan Infantry</a> if you're horde! Pull out an Ally alt if you can, I suggest, makes the trip easier. Not that the weird music is good for the ears.... cross between those weird plastic whistles and some weird grasshopper buzzing noise :l hehe! Good luck grabbing your new pet though folks</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jki4813</b></h3>Went to New Tinkertown today on my Horde char and got one of these. <br /><br />None were spawned outside, so I ran around killing the Snow Cubs and Alpine Hares - took about 3-4 circles of the area until a roach spawned. No going underground necessary.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>frakbt</b></h3>Is there any possibility that the non-battle version of this turns into the battle version some time after spawning? Because capturing the battle ones and killing all the non-battle ones does cause respawns, but the respawns are almost entirely the non-battle version.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>815393</b></h3>The toxic airfield inside new Tinkertown has plenty of the Irradiated Roach. Easy to get for the horde characters. Just clear out the non battle pets and wait for more to spawn if none are up for you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vindictae</b></h3>I have yet to find anything better than white. :/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bunnyoverlord</b></h3>Seems like it should be an easy-to-acquire pet, but in fact, for me it has actually been more of a nightmare than the <a href="/npc=62317/minfernal">Minfernal</a>. Horrendously long spawn timer, regardless of how many non-battle versions you kill and how many pet battles in the area you do to try to get them to pop. I have checked both in Gnomeregan before the instance and over the Toxic Airfield and done murder circuits for hours now and have not seen a single one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>carsono311</b></h3>Just got a rare tonight. Wanted to share my observations on acquiring this extremely frustrating rare:<br /><br />1. It is indeed rare. After hunting for one since Friday, I finally found one tonight. As many others have stated, these guys respawn in an unknown pattern. I found the most capturable spawns in the early morning and following restarts.<br /><br />2. Unlike the other pets I have encountered, these pets do not follow the linear pattern of &quot;the higher the health = the higher the quality&quot;. For example, all of these spawns are Level 1, but I have found three different <b>Uncommon</b> quality health levels: 132, 134, and 138. However, tonight I encountered a 137 hp spawn... I had never seen that before, so I figured I would capture it and see. Sure enough, a rare.<br /><br />3. I found it in the hallway leading to the Gnome starting area in Gnomeregan.<br /><br />Sorry this post is so long, but I hope it helps!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Saidin420</b></h3>My rare was also 137 health, and found underground, in the room at the bottom of the elevator.<br /><br />Made a few gnomes on different servers after maintenance and went through 40-50 roaches before finding it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>892892</b></h3>I made a gnome out of disgust not for the alliance but for gnomes in general just to acquire this pet, after spending an hour running around down stairs i logged back onto my horde. It was right up top outside of the airfield. Was only a grey but im not that worried about getting all the rares.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zivy</b></h3>Running around with a Creepy Crate out while clearing the non battle pets helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>barkles</b></h3>I spent 20 minutes killing irradiated roaches and snow cubs at the toxic airfield until finally a capturable roach spawned (poor, of course). Does the killing make the capturable ones spawn? No idea, but at least it passed the time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>883192</b></h3>Easiest way to catch one, create a gnome toon on a server of low population, still trying servers untill you get one. Good Traps :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maricah</b></h3>The biggest pain fer Horde. All of my gear is broken now, and I still only found ONE (and it was poor quality). Good luck getting a Rare, it's not going to be easy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SargonStarblade</b></h3>Any one else only getting spawns of <a href="/npc=68838/fluxfire-feline">Fluxfire Feline</a> when they do an <a href="/npc=48956/irradiated-roach">Irradiated Roach</a> killing spree in the gnome starting area trying to get a <a href="/npc=61691/irradiated-roach">Irradiated Roach</a>? I have spent 2 days on this now and I found 1 poor quality. Does it spawn inside the instance?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>639386</b></h3>Easier than it might seem to begin with. <br /><br />Make gnome toons on as many servers as it takes to find one that you can battle. It took me 4 servers before I found one where 5 roaches and 3 of those felines were up. Getting a rare or uncommon quality though is a different matter, but I'm simply going to use the buyable stones for this rascal. No poor or common quality in my collection!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Catitude</b></h3>Several 3 hour farming runs during completely different time frames killing all Non battle Pet critters as well as Random Snow Cub battles outside as well as inside Gnomer starting area over 4 days with 1 friend... Not a single Irradiated Roach or Fluxfire Kitten Battle Pet :(<br /><br />Edit: Also have Gnomies posted in starting area on 4 servers. Not a single one :(<br /><br />2nd Edit: Just got both within a couple of minutes of each other. The Irradiated Roach at the south end of the Toxic Airfield close to the Frostmanes &amp; the Fluxfire Kitten at North of the Airfield across the road from the Building with the mailbox in front :D<br />Both Uncommon Yay patience wins! lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AyaJulia</b></h3>I spent literally weeks looking for battleable roaches, only finding about half a dozen the entire time. It was not a passive camping activity, either; I planted toons across about ten different servers, first slaughtering non-combat roaches and then, when that didn't seem to help, other combat and non-combat pets like the alpine hares and snow cubs.<br /><br />With the extremely desirable <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=68838">Fluxfire Feline</a> added in 5.1 spawning in the same area, everyone's had the idea to plant level 1 gnomes on low-pop servers, so this method is not helping (at least, not for me).<br /><br />I finally got my rare roach for my collection by logging in the instant the servers came back up after a Tuesday restart. I logged in to each of my alliance toons and cleared New Tinkertown and the area outside Gnomeregan on three servers, finding about ten roaches each. Within half an hour, there were no more live battleable roaches on any server I logged into.<br /><br />tl;dr: Server restarts are your friend. For me, there was no other way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>larryshair</b></h3>After trying different ways of trying to get this pet (from killing all the critters and pets hoping for respawns) I went ahead and created a Gnome on a low populated realm. I went outside to the Toxic Airfields and found one in the south eastern corner! I would just create a few Gnomes on the lower populated realms and it might help you find one. This worked on my first Gnome creation on a low populated realm. Happy Hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>442012</b></h3>Best idea to capture this pet is to open a new gnome character; doesn't matter if you are Horde for pets are account bound, I wouldn't advice using a horde toon around that area there are level 95 guards that hit like a truck and 2 shot you - I rather made a new toon. Mostly they spawned around the pool area for me, keep killing critters around if you are stuck or check downstairs :) Got this late a t night so can confirm they can also spawn late at night as well</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>665449</b></h3>If you want to get that pet in your collection and you think that it will be easy - forget it :) It's quite hard to be found, so i made a gnome in few servers to get it. At the forth one i finaly got one roach, but it was poor quality. If you can't find a battle pet - try to kill some ordinary ones, also battle every feline you find and look again every 10-20 minutes. If you are a maniac like and want every pet you got to be in rare quality - forget this too, if ofc you don't want to spend few days in that territory. Just try to get one of these shiny new stones and make the roach blue. I hope that post will help you. Happy hunting!<br />Also don't forget that server restart is always your friend - if you log just when the server is open for play - you can find some roaches. I got some luck and got rare one at maybe 10th battle.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>223389</b></h3>I figured it out! The Wowhead map for Irradiated Roach (battle pet) is wrong. Go <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=48956">here</a> to see the real spawn locations. As you can see, they're only in the underground non-instanced Gnomer.<br /><br />According to that map, and my observations, they spawn in the south middle room (The Loading Room) and the area south of the hallway going west to the instance portal. Also in the west sub-room (The Old Dormitory) of the large oval room to the north (Train Depot).<br /><br />Good luck! You will find many Fluxfire Felines before you find your Roach.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1071299</b></h3>Took me 2 days and 12 gnomes on different low populated server's but i finely found one low quality Irradiated Roach at the entrance of Gnomeregan ... can't be bothered to try and get this one as rare ....ill just use a Flawless critter battle-stone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1079223</b></h3>Did they increase the spawn rate on these? Just found 6 in the span of 10min on the same realm, looking for the fluxire feline.<br /><br /> I did the mass murder on the rabbits over the hills before seeing all of these though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>42855</b></h3>I ran around like mad on 5 different gnomes on 5 different low pop realms (hello portugal!). I killed every critter roach i saw. Kept doing this for one full day. Perhaps about 10 runs on each. The only pet that spawned was the fluxfire feline. <br /><br />When i logged on this morning (about 8 servertime) the place was crawling with irradiated roaches all over the gnome starting area. I even got a rare. This was a day when the server had restarted i might add. <br /><br />So this strategy works fine to get the irradiated roach. Just log in at the &quot;right&quot; time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Yaracklea</b></h3>Confirming was in after server restart and no roaches were available. Killed some critters inside, went out on the toxic field, killed critters and capturable pets for about 3 minutes and one roach spawned OUTSIDE in the middle of the toxic field. Another one was inside the starting area, in the central area. Poor quality but it will do :/<br />Good luck farming!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>330339</b></h3>Just find some some roaches and kill them. When new ones spawn, some will be battle pets. Have fun.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1044155</b></h3>Trying to farm up a rare of this has kind of broken my spirit. I have 505 unique pets and have been very patient with collecting most of them, but even after creating gnomes on a dozen or so realms after a server restart, all I could find were uncommons at best.<br /><br />However, there were a LOT of them around after a server restart, so it seems like the best time to farm it. It seems like the rest of the time, the only pets around are the Fluxfire Feline and the Snow Cub.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1066931</b></h3>I ran all over all the places that supposedly spawn this critter in tameable form, and I couldn't find it anywhere, except in the gnome starter area. The two I found there, on two different days, were both poor quality. After spending an hour killing or battling everything in sight around the gnome starting area, with nary a single new roach spawn, I gave up on my server.<br /><br />I changed tactics by rolling new gnomes on alternate servers. I tried three severs, and there was a tameable roach sitting in the big round center room of the gnome starting area on <u>every single server</u>. One of them was uncommon. I'm settling for that. If you are looking for a rare, I highly recommend the &quot;make a new gnome&quot; method.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>477416</b></h3>i used the advice from other people and i got mine. it was a rare but im happy with it! I flew past new tinkertown to the west mountains and killed every alpine hare there (not battled, killed), flew back over to new tinkertown and found 4 of the roaches roaming around! thanks for the advice!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kg4wyt</b></h3>I took my 85 druid into Gnomergon and killed the first two bosses. I then ran back out. The room right before going out of instance in front of me spawned one irradiated roach. I was like woot! No all I need for archie is ape :(.... lol. Hope this helps someone :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lichbornne</b></h3>Went looking for the fluxfire feline this morning between 8am and 9am and the area was flooded with dozens of roaches. I don't even want the roach and got 2 rares in about 10 minutes. So, if you want this pet, you might want to try getting it early in the morning. There were zero fluxfire felines, and after capturing or killing the roaches, more spawned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>adashiel</b></h3>The high-health (i.e., #6, H/H) <a href="http://www.warcraftpets.com/wow-pet-battles/breeds/">breed</a> of the irradiated roach has more health than any other pet with the roach/beetle moveset and also the highest of any pet with <a href="/pet-ability=519/apocalypse">Apocalypse</a>*.<br /><br />*Though they have less health, I prefer the <a href="/npc=61386/lava-beetle">Lava Beetle</a> and <a href="/npc=61328/fire-beetle">Fire Beetle</a> for Apocalypse builds, since they can self-heal with <a href="/pet-ability=173/cauterize">Cauterize</a>.(##RESPBREAK##)2056##DELIM##adashiel##DELIM##</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Catweazle</b></h3>I ran around Gnomer for hours trying to find one of these, wading through dozens of flux felines. I even came here to check and see if there was a certain time of day for them. At long last I spotted one up on one of the walkways. I ran to it happily thinking I was finally going to get my pet but when I clicked on it all I got was &quot;Pet battle area is obstructed&quot;.<br /><br />Seriously Blizzard? Why do you hate me?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1150039</b></h3>Not sure if anyone has said it yet..but there actually is a 'goblin teleporter' that will take you right down to gnomegran so you don't have to worry about those pesky lvl 95 elites killing you. The teleporter is located in Northern stranglehorn at the Grolgrom base camp.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>657368</b></h3>I tried flying in and got ganked by the guards.. then I read this forum .. and was like DUH, create a toon on a different server is an excellent idea. I picked a server at random.. created a gnome.. as soon as I logged in there was one of these at my feet. Poor quality.. after the battle I looked around and about 10' away there was another.. so I battled it and it was a rare.. woot. LOVE this forum!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1226753</b></h3>I spent over 2 hours killing all the non-battle roaches down in Gnomeregan and only had 2 Fluxfire Felines spawn and no roaches. Then I went up to the Toxic Airfield and spent 10 minutes killing the non-battle roaches and had about 7 battle roaches spawn within the next 20 minutes (including a rare) on the toxic airfield.<br /><br />Don't waste your time underground since there seems to be very few spawn points down there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sabrines</b></h3>Tried every suggestion while on my Horde 90 on Suramar. Killing the battle pets around Dun Morogh and then flying back into Tinkertown did nothing, unless there was someone also doing pet battles there while I was doing this. Nothing spawned. So I went on my Level 1 Gnome that I've not felt like leveling and still nothing. There was ONE Irradiated Roach underground and it was uncommon. Bleck! Then I tried going onto Aerie Peak. Still nothing. I had been searching for 2 hours straight and hadn't even seen a Fluxfire Feline. Finally, I switched to the Latin American server Drakkari. FINALLY a Fluxfire. Alas, it was Uncommon. Battled all the pets there, and none yielded anything higher than a Common. Switched to the Brazil server Gallywix. 3 Fluxfire rares IN A ROW! Also, found a Rare Irradiated Roach on same server a few more battles in. Just a little tip to anyone not being able to find any on their US server!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>turainia</b></h3>I tried the rabbit method too, it worked like a charm. Not only did I get my pet, it was also a RARE!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Triffy</b></h3>This was the last pet capture I needed. Spent a good couple of hours trying various of the suggested methods to no avail. In desperation i logged into a toon i had made in vanilla days on an RP realm and took a trip down to Gnomeregan. Be it luck, or timing there were four roaches ripe for the capture waiting for me on the toxic airfield. 3 grey and 1 green. <br /><br />I have no idea whether this will always be the case (that sparsely populated realms are good for battle pet hunting) , but given the frustration I experienced, I thought I would share this and maybe it will help.<br /><br />Good Luck<br /><br />P.S. The ones I encountered were all level one, and tend to be squishy against anything rare. If you are hitting the roaches for between 30 - 40 ; 3 hits is not enough to capture, and 4 hits is one too many.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tcip</b></h3><b>How to capture this pet</b><br /><br /><ol><li>Create a <a href="/race=7/gnome">Gnome</a> on a low populated server.</li><li>Login to the new character and just run forward and you will see them on your minimap</li></ol><br /><br />Simple isen't it? =)<br /><br />Video for those of you who do not think it works: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQg6HCMFUJE" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQg6HCMFUJE</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Grabnex</b></h3>This is what I did and it worked within 5 minutes. Go to the airfield. Check it (of course!). Open Custom Raid finder, hop realms to someone with an auto accept. Recheck airfield. Rinse and repeat until you get your roach. Hope it helps!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cajun06</b></h3>I kept coming back to this area every few hours and I finally found ONE in the Toxic Airfield near Gnomeregan.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sirloper</b></h3>As horde, rather than make an Alliance toon, I just flew into the entrance of Gnomeran (and died -- 4x elite pvp guards at the entrance) at the bottom of the ramp. Ran back, resurrected, and went down the lift. No less than 4-6 of the little guys right there. No rares, but to me the little repair bill and sense of accomplishment was worth not having to create a new toon and WALK (lol)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>collyflower07</b></h3>I found this roach (without killing any critters or anything) around 43, 59 (The Toxic Airfield in New Tinkertown)</div>
