Humanoid hit helps here and in PvE\/PvP you get a stun very useful if you decide not to use the humanoid damage. Elemental damage is average and fairly consistant and is strong against those pesky mechanical pets due to its elemental moves and a Elemental race typing. Beast damage adds flexibility to this set for different situations.Also as an elemental it ignores weather effects so use this to an advantage against your enemies.\n\nMajor downfall for this pet in a team is lack of spike damage  move early on and no heal factor,  but the longer than average elemental dot and slightly larger health pool helps here with switch out and endurance teams.\n\nThis pet may seem rare but it really is easy once you know how to make it spawn.\nTiny Bog Beast  is significantly larger than the other critters in the area.\nTiny Bog Beast is located by the lakes area west\/northwest of Greenwardens grove around and near their larger cousins (not on them that's only flavor text).\n\nStep One: Kill the critters (battle and regular) in the area including the critters (battle and regular) on the border and a little ways into the Direforge Hill area and the border of the Ironforge Tomb area\n           *helpful tip right clicking will start a battle but left clicking allows you to use a character ability to kill capture creatures.*\nStep Two: fly\/run around the area in a good pattern going from the lower end all the way to the top near the mountains edge.\nStep Three: spawn may take 5-20 mins depending on last kill and RNG spawning timers.\n\nReason you kill the critters,  tiny bog beast shares spawn spots with the critters and ALSO slots for if it can spawn since the area has a maximum critter count. Thus you need to make sure it has places to spawn. Though it may not necessarily spawn right where you kill the critters. It will often spawn close to them within 5-15 yards of any critter point. That's why you must run the whole area.\n(Killing critters in the second green belt area where the whelps are may help as well)\n\nOther helpful hint. after a server restart\/maintenance there will be 5-15 of these running around though once these are used up it goes back to the original 1-3 up at a time thing often only spawning the extras  after you kill\/defeat\/capture one. Most i've seen up at once and not just respawn is 2.\n\nCommon qualities: common, and uncommon. Though i've seen a few poor ones they don't seem to happen as often. \nFinally got a rare, mine is speed based but thats fine :D its base stats are normally 62\/62 and 447 health at lvl 6 and if its stats(not health) get the boost its 69 no clue what a health boost stat is.\n\nuncommon stats vary but base is 58\/58\/420hp with the extra points bumping one of the three previous stats slightly but only one of them to 64 for stats and 460 for health.","date":"2012-09-28T18:49:22-05:00","rating":148,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"This method does work well.

It really didn't help. After killing every critter in sight multiple times over the course of an hour and seeing no Tiny Bog Beast, I got mad and decided to kill everything that moved around the boggy spawning area. And as soon as I had killed about 10 regular creatures, a common Tiny Bog Beast pet spawned. I decided to keep trying this method in hopes of a rare. Ten more regular creatures dead and another pet spawned. I could actually see it spawn on my map the instant I killed a creature. I got a pet to spawn every 10-15 regular kills. I ignored the critters entirely, just to test this theory that they spawn only when critters are killed. Lo and behold, they spawn without killing critters. After about 2 hours of this, I got a rare spawn and got out of dodge. I may never go back there again. But my advice is, just kill EVERYTHING around the boggy pond area. Oh, and this method also caused the spawn of a Semi-Rare Bogling Boss named [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=14424\/mirelow#drops]Mirelow[\/url].

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1016987</b></h3>Any idea where to find it?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Troelsy</b></h3>After coming back a few times searching for one of these I did find ONE in the area the map suggests. Not on the back of another mob however, but standing on his own. When I caught him he turned out to be common in quality so I can imagine I'll come back a few times until I get a rare quality one. When I flew around there at 7pm server time there were none. It was around 9pm server time when I spotted him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1037258</b></h3>I captured 2 of these between 5pm server and 5:30 pm server. an Uncommon with 460hp and 58 power/speed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1037412</b></h3>Captured mines at 9:22am (Eastern). Found it near the heart-shaped pond northwest of Greenwarden's Grove. Mines was a poor quality.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Luckymoon</b></h3>What makes this pet unique for the pet battle system: <br />Humanoid/Elemental/Beast move pool. <br /><br />Dragons in the pvp function of pet battle are annoying. Humanoid hit helps here and in PvE/PvP you get a stun very useful if you decide not to use the humanoid damage. Elemental damage is average and fairly consistant and is strong against those pesky mechanical pets due to its elemental moves and a Elemental race typing. Beast damage adds flexibility to this set for different situations.Also as an elemental it ignores weather effects so use this to an advantage against your enemies.<br /><br />Major downfall for this pet in a team is lack of spike damage move early on and no heal factor, but the longer than average elemental dot and slightly larger health pool helps here with switch out and endurance teams.<br /><br />This pet may seem rare but it really is easy once you know how to make it spawn.<br />Tiny Bog Beast is significantly larger than the other critters in the area.<br />Tiny Bog Beast is located by the lakes area west/northwest of Greenwardens grove around and near their larger cousins (not on them that's only flavor text).<br /><br />Step One: Kill the critters (battle and regular) in the area including the critters (battle and regular) on the border and a little ways into the Direforge Hill area and the border of the Ironforge Tomb area<br /> *helpful tip right clicking will start a battle but left clicking allows you to use a character ability to kill capture creatures.*<br />Step Two: fly/run around the area in a good pattern going from the lower end all the way to the top near the mountains edge.<br />Step Three: spawn may take 5-20 mins depending on last kill and RNG spawning timers.<br /><br />Reason you kill the critters, tiny bog beast shares spawn spots with the critters and ALSO slots for if it can spawn since the area has a maximum critter count. Thus you need to make sure it has places to spawn. Though it may not necessarily spawn right where you kill the critters. It will often spawn close to them within 5-15 yards of any critter point. That's why you must run the whole area.<br />(Killing critters in the second green belt area where the whelps are may help as well)<br /><br />Other helpful hint. after a server restart/maintenance there will be 5-15 of these running around though once these are used up it goes back to the original 1-3 up at a time thing often only spawning the extras after you kill/defeat/capture one. Most i've seen up at once and not just respawn is 2.<br /><br />Common qualities: common, and uncommon. Though i've seen a few poor ones they don't seem to happen as often. <br />Finally got a rare, mine is speed based but thats fine :D its base stats are normally 62/62 and 447 health at lvl 6 and if its stats(not health) get the boost its 69 no clue what a health boost stat is.<br /><br />uncommon stats vary but base is 58/58/420hp with the extra points bumping one of the three previous stats slightly but only one of them to 64 for stats and 460 for health.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>normajt</b></h3>3:45PDT Emerald Dream, on arrival first attempt captured uncommon! Submitted SS<br /><br />update: took almost an hour for ANYTHING to respawn in the area I captured the first (the &quot;heart shape' swamp area)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aiyame</b></h3>2:45pm EST (server and here) I found at least 5-6 of these guys hanging out where the pins are in the map above. 2 common, 1 uncommon, and the rest poor. A friend/guildie found one during the EST afternoon, found only one which was rare. <br /><br />Not sure if this helps, but I don't know where in the world (not &quot;of warcraft&quot;) it has to be night, but we found them at those times.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>iffy</b></h3>I found several of these up around 4pm Eastern. It was not raining, so I don't think the spawn is night-time or weather-related. Several spawned as I ran around battling them and killing the other non-bog-beast critters. Probably a half-dozen spawned in 10-15 minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>597835</b></h3>Health was 357 on the only rare I found, lvl 6 - during battle.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ragnar1</b></h3>If you have characters on several realms, go to the catching spot, fight/catch the Tiny Bog Beasts present and then repeat on another realm. Low pop realms first.<br />This is MUCH more potent than killing &amp; waiting for respawns; if no one has been there in some hours, there'll usually be 5-ish of them there, sometimes even more. <br /><br />I did this, here are the results:<br />1st realm: 4 poor, 1 common<br />2nd realm: 3 poor, 1 common, 1 uncommon<br />3rd realm: 3 poor, 2 common, 6 uncommon, RARE<br /><br />The two first realms were high pop, 3rd realm was low, therefore more Bog Beasts (there were at least 3 which i didn't even fight)<br /><br />Also, after the two first realms i tried two realms which i didn't list. There were no Tiny Bog Beasts present = someone else had been there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ladris</b></h3>I have a hard time finding any, but when I logged in this morning and it was raining I found a TON of them. Once it stopped raining, the number of them dropped back to next to nothing. Perhaps these do spawn more depending on weather. Can anyone else confirm this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>pendergast4</b></h3>Woot, got a rare after a restart, first time! Granted that was after farming for an hour without seeing ANY before the restart.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1048121</b></h3>I confirm several sightings of them in the zone when it is raining</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>naimc</b></h3>Well, I just killed the only one I found. Yay me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>oscarucb</b></h3>Luckymoon's technique of repeatedly clearing all the critters in the area to force a Bog Beast spawn works like a charm. Make sure you cover the entire sub area from the north mountains to south mountains - if battle pets are chilling against the northern or southern end of the subzone it can prevent new wild battle pets from spawning.<br /><br />Here's a good macro to spam for finding all the critters in the subzone:<br /><br />/tar toad <br />/stopmacro <br />/tar mouse <br />/stopmacro <br />/tar black rat <br />/stopmacro <br />/tar water snake<br />/stopmacro <br />/tar frog <br />/stopmacro <br />/tar mountain <br /><br />This ensures you target any live critter in range. I've deliberately omitted Tiny Bog Beast from this list so you don't accidentally kill the spawn you are waiting for - just keep an eye on the minimap for battle pet spawns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Koshut</b></h3>if you are searching for a rare one you need to look when you battle em for a 403hp one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maricah</b></h3>I had seriously sour luck with this one. Came to the area with only one there, captured it JUST in case, tho it was a poor quality. Then I followed the other comments and went around, clearing both battle pets and critters, and nothing spawned back. This is another of many that will take time to get a rare. I'll post again if I actually get one. But be prepared to take yer time with this one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1064791</b></h3>I killed about 10 critters and battle pets and the bog beast spawned for me. Took about five minutes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>708922</b></h3>The other macro is wrong, here is a better one:<br /><br /><div class="quote-box"><br />/tar toad <br />/stopmacro <br />/tar mouse <br />/stopmacro <br />/tar black r<br />/stopmacro <br />/tar water<br />/stopmacro <br />/tar frog <br />/stopmacro <br />/tar mount<br />/stopmacro <br />/cleartarget<br /></div><br /><br />Im not sure whats up with my luck but when i got here there were 3 pet battles and about 6 critters, killed em all. Its now 2h later and ive not even seen another pet battle let alone bog beast. Just more &amp; more critters :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>776458</b></h3>Why wouldn't these be in Zangarmarsh? It just seems obvious.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1069579</b></h3>I spent 40 minutes running around killing innocent critters and battle pets to get one poor quality Tiny Bog Beast. I feel terrible.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>killertofu</b></h3>I was out in the Wetlands farming rare spawns when I came upon a plethora of <a href="/npc=61686/tiny-bog-beast">Tiny Bog Beast</a> surrounding the water in the Green Belt area. I battled 3 and captured an uncommon one. I was about to leave when I noticed another batch a bit more south. The first one I battled was a rare! I was so happy and surprised. Good Luck on finding the rare of this tiny beast :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>964984</b></h3>OK someone please check this out for me , i was flying over the marsh with fly master and i saw like pffff 10-15 tine bog beast ... i was kinda happy , so once i land in the village just a bit north i run right away in the marsh ... nothing .... so i came to a conclusion , could it be that the area is phased and people would have to do quest to acces it ?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DevelopmentTOHRU</b></h3>This rare is fairly easy to obtain. I went around the map 1,5 times killing every battle critter I saw, and some other critters aswell of they were in range. That took me about 10 minutes.<br />Went back to the Spawn Location North-West from GreenWarden Grove, there I found 2 of them already spawned. <br /><br />This is a tactic that works on nearly every rare battle pet. My advise however is that you wait until there are few online. So that when you are clearing the map someone else wont claim your reward.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>972069</b></h3>I was beginning to think these were a myth! Then Sunday 13/Jan/2013 at 12:57 server time (and after killing <i>everything</i> in the area twice) one spawned (55.00, 27.86). Only a poor this time but at least I can continue my life now. :)<br /><br />Just finished typing this back to Wetlands and a rare spawned at 13:11 server time (54.39, 33.12). Oh yes, well happy now! :P</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>joebowen</b></h3>I see that many of you have mentioned clearing the area to cause them to spawn. I flew there for the first time and found one right away. All local creatures were alive. I killed nothing. Perhaps someone had killed them all before I arrived, thus spawning Bog Beasts. But, all would have had to respawn since then, and the Tiny Bog Beast was there for me. So, it seems this may not be necessary, as it is unlikely the described scenario occurred.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Alaurynn</b></h3>I tested the idea that killing all the critters in the area would cause the bogling pet to spawn faster. It really didn't help. After killing every critter in sight multiple times over the course of an hour and seeing no Tiny Bog Beast, I got mad and decided to kill everything that moved around the boggy spawning area. And as soon as I had killed about 10 regular creatures, a common Tiny Bog Beast pet spawned. I decided to keep trying this method in hopes of a rare. Ten more regular creatures dead and another pet spawned. I could actually see it spawn on my map the instant I killed a creature. I got a pet to spawn every 10-15 regular kills. I ignored the critters entirely, just to test this theory that they spawn only when critters are killed. Lo and behold, they spawn without killing critters. After about 2 hours of this, I got a rare spawn and got out of dodge. I may never go back there again. But my advice is, just kill EVERYTHING around the boggy pond area. Oh, and this method also caused the spawn of a Semi-Rare Bogling Boss named <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=14424/mirelow#drops">Mirelow</a>. He spawned for me three times in 2 hours, even though Wow Atlas has his spawn timer at 8+ hours. He dropped <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=890">Twisted Chanter's Staff</a>, which looks pretty cool.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shelinda</b></h3>I've been killing critters as suggested in the highest rated comment, for about 15 min now. The problem is that the critters that spawn are unkillable <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=7395">Undercity Cockroaches</a>. I believe it's a bug but I didn't see any comment here about it. I don't even know why they would spawn here, but it's so annoying to not being able to kill them off...<br /><br />Did anyone else have this problem?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aponina</b></h3>Thanks for good advice, i stay on place, kill critter 1h and i see respawn 6 little bogs, and my 6 my lucky one and rare :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1092594</b></h3>Its funny, right after reading this I was ready to kill everything in sight. Then when i went back to the game, there was one right under me....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>764992</b></h3>My ode to hunting a rare TBB:<br /><br />Undercity Cockroach, why are you here?<br />Iâ€™m hunting Tiny Bog Beasts, but see none near.<br />I fly the different spawn points, clearing as I go.<br />But youâ€™re not killable, must you vex me so?<br /><br />Undercity Cockroach, why are you here?<br />Go back to your home town, so Tiny Bog Beasts might appear.<br />If you refuse to leave this place, might I ask a boon?<br />Let me clear your spawn point, stop with the immune.<br /><br />An idle mind waiting for spawns is a terrible thing... :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kuriara</b></h3>6 hours later 0 bog beast spawns, sigh, time to move on....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1101420</b></h3>I got my rare TBB today! I was just flying over and saw a green paw appear and decided to go for it. (I already had a poor quality one) <br /><br />This one just so happened to be rare. When I got my first one, I did not need to kill other critters in the area, there were probably 8-10 of them just wondering around.<br /><br />Good luck hunting everyone!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>maryalice</b></h3>I captured mine today in Wetlands at 53.0, 37.8 Good luck :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>llykstw</b></h3>Here's a simple method of capturing one of these if you can never see one on your server and play an Alliance character. <br /><br />Fly to Arathi Highlands via flightpaths (Refuge Point). Then enter this macro: <br /><br />/cleartarget<br />/tar tiny bog beast<br /><br />Bind a key to 'interact with target'.<br /><br />Fly to Greenwarden's Grove. After you fly over the bridge and into lake area, you should see some Tiny Bog Beasts appear on the minimap. These will usually disappear once you land at Greenwarden's Grove and phase into your crossrealm server, so as you fly over the wild pets, spam your macro button to target them, then spam your 'interact with target' button. There's a good chance that you'll enter a battle mid-flight, and then just capture one. It worked first time for me, as you fly so low.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cowina</b></h3>Caught a rare today at 52.99 30.77. Spent maybe an hour leveling pets in the area. Seems like these pop up when you battle other pets in the area. Hope this helps!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shashos</b></h3>The ability to force spawn these little guys via killing Mirebeast and Lasher mobs does work, but I noticed something interesting this morning. After spawning in two TBB's by clearing out mobs, they simply stopped spawning.<br /><br />As I was looting another mob, right before me spawned in a tameable Black Rat instead. I got rid of that one to clear the green paw off my map, just in case, and went back to killing mobs. Still no TBB. It seemed the Black Rat spawned in instead.<br /><br />Then it started raining. Once it started raining, nothing at all spawned in despite me killing dozens of mobs all over the area. I don't know if this is related, but it was interesting to note that during the rain, no TBB's would spawn.<br /><br />Now, that said, there might have been something else at work. It was edging close to time for the rolling restarts this morning. Maybe the pet spawn mechanic shuts down at a certain point right before a restart. Maybe it was the rain. I have no idea. Just something puzzling I noticed today while leveling my baby alt. :)<br /><br />Edit: As soon as the servers came back up, TBB's were all over the area and it was no longer raining!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lorielle</b></h3>I have begun gathering all the different pets available for my character, and I have found that with this specific one that killing the mobs in that area do yield a Tiny Bog Beast spawn. <br /><br />I killed 15-20 and took a short break, and when I returned there were 4 spawns, 2 of which were uncommon. I'm hoping to be able to find my rare before too long, but I'm happy either way.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lordluthar</b></h3>Well, after killing the NPC's in the spawn area for an hour without a single spawn I went back to leveling/capturing the Pets I was after. When I flew back over the bog area, I started seeing pet spawns. Unfortunately they weren't Ting Bog's, but they were spawning. I started doing other pet battles and come back after every 5 or so battle and there would be more spawns.<br /><br />Kept doing this for about 15 minutes and I finally got a Tiny Bog to spawn. SO killing the spawns did nothing, but doing pet battles spawned them. SO if you aren't having success killing the NPC's, do pet battles. Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1455404</b></h3>After nearly two hours of trying to make this pet spawn by killing critters and other battle pets, I searched a little further down the comments section. There's a lot of people saying killing the Mobs in the area that the pet spawns in will make it spawn, and guess what - within five minutes of AoE'ing both the mobs and the critters in the area, one spawned. I didn't go any further to test whether killing the mobs really made it spawn or if it was an odd co-incidence, but it did feel like it worked. My advice to people is to kill both pets/critters and mobs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>89813</b></h3>Maybe this has changed but I went to where it shows on the map now and they are everywhere. I counted 9 just flying the area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>598155</b></h3>Apparently this is supposed to be rare, however, I must've been lucky cause I found one almost as soon as I entered Wetlands.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ForsakenFireMage</b></h3>I'm having no luck compared to other recents comments so I'm convinced it is rare and these people who commented recently just got lucky. Zero are flying around compared to the person who said they saw multiples (unless they spawn at a certain time of day). There's only been like 5 battle pets that I battled, 3 critters to kill and I killed all mobs within the area of the dots on the map.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>schnizol</b></h3>Apparently their spawning depends on something specific - there were none on my server, but after a server hop - just one - I got to a server which had their spawning location FULL of them. I got 3 rares of 3 different breeds in no time.<br /><br />So, if you can't find them, do a server hop and you should eventually find them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ForsakenFireMage</b></h3>I think it might be a time of day situation. I was looking for them the other day around 7pm eastern time and couldn't find any. Now today at 12:30pm eastern time I'm seeing at least 10 of them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Noxpredor</b></h3>After flying around for hours killing EVERYTHING that move, No Dice. Used the group finder to realm hop via Kazzak groups, traders, etc. Got it on first realm hop without moving. REALM HOP FTW!</div>
