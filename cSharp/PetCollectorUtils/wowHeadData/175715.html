I'm not sure if the Postmaster will mail it to you after the fact.\n\n[b]5][\/b] After you loot the object, you will need to wait about 5 minutes for it to happen again.\n\n[b]6][\/b] As long as you do not turn in the quest (or it expires), your special trainee will stay with you and you can continue to get loot \nevery 5 minutes after a kill.\n\nI have done the trainee quest many times, but today (Feb 19, 2021) was the first time I ever got Twinklewings as my trainee. \nOut of all the loot I received from the Dirty Glinting Object, none of it was vendor trash (grey), but I did vendor all the food. A few \nitems I have never seen before.\n\nHere is an example of some of the loot I got:\n\n[item=184501] x3\n[item=184503] x3\n[item=184506]\n[item=172903]\nVarious Flawless Battle-Stones\nVarious Battle-Training stones\nVarious potions\nVarious gems\nVarious foods\n\nAdditional notes:\n\nOne thing I discovered was that you cannot \"cheat\" the 5 minute timer. For example, let's say you want to park your character, log off, log on with another character and play with them for 5 minutes or more, log off and then back on to the character with the quest. The timer stops when you log off and then resumes when you log back on. So, you don't save time this way.\n\nFor this reason, I used a chat command [b]\/timer 300[\/b]\n\nI put myself in a non-hostile area, kill an enemy, loot the Dirty Glinting Object, start the 5 minute timer then walk away from the computer and go do some 5 minute household chores like take out the garbage, clean the kitchen sink, put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher, and so forth, then come back to the computer to find the timer at zero and repeat. I was able to get a lot done around the house this way.\n\nI finally got Lucy after about 36 loots (36 x 5 = 180 minutes = 3 hours) but more realistically like 4 hours because I wasn't religious with the 5 minute timer.\n\nI also decided not to turn in this quest just yet. I have 2 more days and 7 hours before it expires. I think I want to get more loot tomorrow and the next day to try for another Lucy and some more of those pocket portals and pet battle stuff. I will re-edit this post in the next day or two to let you know how that turns out.\n\nI hope this information helps you and I hope you get your Lucy battle pet.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nHere is my update after day 1:\n\nOn day 2, I got another Lucy pet. I wasn't keeping track, but it was pretty quick, like my 3rd or 4th loot.

He's the trainee who spawns Dirty Glinting Objects on the ground.<br /><br />If you're tied to the Venthyr and you get Drippy, run around the zone they assigned you to train him in and do stuff so he'll dig for you. He doesn't expire after your three mandatory training world quests, and as of now he continues to dig, though he seems to only dig in response to you killing a monster or completing a WQ. He will not dig if you just idle there.<br /><br />I believe you have to get specifically Drippy. He's the bald one. I had a different dredge with hair before and if he dug at all, I didn't see it.</div>

I grinded some mobs AFTER the last quest was done and got lucky at the area where you have to collect the 20 sin stones. Got the emote &gt;Drippy: &quot;Dredged up somethin' interesting over here, boss!&lt; and the cat was mine. It seems to take some minutes until he finds something.<br /><br />So you definietly can farm this for 3 days if you want, just dont turn in the &quot;meta quest&quot; in your base.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tph88</b></h3>Is there anyway to know which trainee you have before going to the zone that the quest is in?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tooltip</b></h3>Patch 10.0.0 and her icon still disappears when you &quot;pick&quot; her up with the cursor. &nbsp; Truly an elusive cat.<br /><br /><u>Edit</u>: Patch 10.1.0 appears to have finally fixed this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>xLunacyx</b></h3>You may think 70% or 80% attack my not miss THAT often, but it still feels like it misses more than it hits.</div>
