They are littered all around and through the Ahn'qiraj gates and come in a variety of exquisite shades. Unlike most other minipets, they do not have any sound on click at all.<br /><br />These mobs share spawns with Sidewinders, as well, so if you are searching for scarabs, and you find a sidewinder in the area of the Scarab Wall or Ahn'Qiraj, kill it (or battle/capture it) and you may be able to get a scarab to spawn in its place.<br /><br />In addition, they can appear as an additional fighter in the battles with other pets through the zone. I had one jump on me when I challenged a Sidewinder. Thus, if you are having difficulty getting one to spawn for you, battle other creatures in the zone and you may get lucky as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Treekachu</b></h3>These pets are exclusive to Silithus and can be found <s>without any battle partners (so it will be your battle pets versus this one alone)</s> ONLY within the confines of the Ahn'Qiraj portion of the Silithus map. In other words, you do not need to zone into the instance, rather, simply fly over it. Otherwise, they have a low chance of being a member of an enemy team randomly throughout the zone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sethris</b></h3>I just want to clarify, you have to fly over the instance gate and around the AQ zone, these do not spawn in/around the scarab wall area. You'll see a lot of them there as critters but I've yet to see any spawn as battle pets, except by flying over the instance gate and around AQ.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mcdisney2001</b></h3>I just had one of these appear as a secondary to a beetle in the Hive Regal portion of Un' Goro. So it is NOT exclusive to AQ. Wish I'd know it was there before I'd tamed the first pet. :-(<br /><br />EDIT: Please don't down-vote posts just because you haven't had the same experience. I simply wanted people to know that the pet did appear in Un' Goro. Whether or not it was a bug is unknown, but the information might be of some use toother players seeking to collect pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rhinoloupe</b></h3>These scarabs come in 4 different colours, 2 of which are unique to them.<br /><br /><a href="/npc=54745/sand-scarab">Sand Scarab</a> shares the yellow skin, and <a href="/npc=62899/tolvir-scarab">Tol'vir Scarab</a> shares the blue skin.

But it was in my pet journal, as I had captured one a few weeks earlier.<br /><br />Instead of opening a ticket, I went back and caught another.<br /><br />That fixed the problem. Released the duplicate, and all is well, with no GM intervention.<br /><br />*This also happened with the Black Lamb*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Urrokk</b></h3>If you're like me and only farm rare pets, this can be a tedious task. As stated in previous posts, the best and most populated place is over the actual instances. They do seem to share spawn points with sidewinders, which are the only other primary pets. After 6 hours of farming, only once did I have a hatchling come up as a secondary pet with a sidewinder, and that was actually outside of the instances. The provided map is accurate and a good reference tool. <br /><br />If you're farming this pet exclusively, my advise is to kill the sidewinders and wait for the respawns. Sadly, I never did encounter a rare and had to use a battle-stone to upgrade an uncommon. Better luck to anyone else farming this pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tygokor</b></h3>This one proved more tedious than expected. Sidewinders by and far were most prevalent in the area for me. Never did they have a scarab of any quality with them. The handful I encountered were all poor quality scarabs too. After killing every critter and battle pet in the actual area you'd walk around in the instance I was successful though. Found a pair of them skittering around on the far south west section of the ruins. Fortunately I was indeed flying or it wouldn't be accessible. One more rare added to the Pokedex. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Memnok</b></h3>I don't know if this has changed with patches, but I was completely unable to find any <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62524">Scarab Hatchlings</a> as secondary pets to the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62523">Sidewinders</a>.<br /><br />However I found exactly one scarab in all of AQ20 (un-instanced) and it was at <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=15339">Ossirian's </a>spawnpoint if I were zoned into <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/zone=3429">AQ20 </a>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cUnAzeroth</b></h3>I am not sure if this is a coincidence, but I did notice that when I was battling <a href="/npc=62184/rock-viper">Rock Viper</a>s in and around The Crystal Vale in <a href="/zone=1377/silithus">Silithus</a> that Scarab Hatchlings would OFTEN show up as secondary pets. Still hoping that one shows up as rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>selkie47</b></h3>Made a circle around the uninstanced AQ, battling all the sidewinders I saw. None had the scarab as a secondary. Got to the last leg of my 'circle' and there was scarab just waiting for me!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>meruhd</b></h3>For anyone trying to get Kalimdor Safari in Legion, as the highest rated comment here says, one of the best places to farm is in the zone AQ (not the instance). However, now the Scarab Hatchlings appear with companion pets; they no longer spawn solo in that zone. They are still more rare spawns than the Sidewinder pet, but I saw one last night and one this morning. I also spotted a couple outside of the instance along the scarab wall.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lamecode</b></h3>Found this one after around 15 minutes. <br />10 minutes I spent in the old phase, then I switched with Zidormi to the new phase (with the sword stabbed in Azeroth), then found one in uninstanced lower AQ at <b>50.29, 54.83</b>, 12:50 PM</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ImpatientLola</b></h3>It can be found as a secondary pet.</div>
