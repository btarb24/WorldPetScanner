Explode is... a marginal move, at best.  Its only purpose is pure spite, and for what it does its damage is quite low -- you would be better served by Ion Cannon, which does 125% of Explode's damage and you might actually survive using.\r\n\r\nThen there comes the question: Meteor Strike or Nether Gate?  I answer this question with a question: Do you expect your Abyssal to go first?  If you do, you get more value out of Nether Gate, since it costs the opponent their turn as well as doing high damage.  The forced swap can also be a life saver if your opponent leads with a dragonkin  (hey, dragonkin usually have pretty low speed...).  If, on the other hand, you're going second?  Meteor Strike is better damage.  It comes with a turn of invincibility, though your opponent will expect it.  If used on the same turn, the slower of two moves of this category wins... Say you Meteor Strike and a faster snake burrows on the same turn:  The snake erupts from the ground and misses, only to get clobbered.  It's a corner case, but that might be all the edge you need.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a decent pet.","date":"2013-05-29T11:39:07-05:00","rating":9,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"One thing to note about explode.

It is obtained from a <a href="http://ptr.wowhead.com/item=97550">Netherspace Portal-Stone</a><br /><br />This drops from <a href="http://ptr.wowhead.com/npc=15690"> Prince Malchezaar</a>, who is the last boss from <a href="http://ptr.wowhead.com/zone=3457"> Karazhan</a>.<br /><br />Based off other pet drops from raid bosses, it would be safe to assume that it will have a drop rate of between <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> percent.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aeolyn</b></h3>This pet will sometimes stop what it's doing and start spamming Hellfire while you have it out. Pretty slick and a wonderful throwback to the boss battle in Kara.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sidhebane</b></h3>Whose stupid idea was it to have these rare drop pets come in multiple breeds?<br />After seven runs of kara, which means seven fricking times passing chess, he finally drops, and I'm pretty happy.<br /><br />I take a look at his move set, and think, &quot;you know, he could be pretty useful. Hang on, there's only one breed of these, right? Right?&quot;.<br /><br />Apparently not. Mine is H/H, and there apparently is a P/P who hits about 15% harder... Slightly poisons the joy of finally seeing the damn thing drop<br /><br />I stand by my position that breed is a poorly-thought-out concept which does nothing but disappoint tamers who spend the effort to find and capture rare (in both sense) pets. If they wanted the same pet with different stats, well, that's why there are 50 types of rabbit and 200 types of rat...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TevishSzat</b></h3>Comes in 3 breeds -- I prefer 100% Power or Power/Speed<br /><br />Utilizes similar (but not identical) moves to the Minfernal. I think this one is better, because it doesn't use the largely uninteresting Extra Plating.<br /><br />The three moves I'd like to talk about are Meteor Strike, Explode, and Nether Gate.<br /><br />I normally would not take Explode, but since it's against Immolation (a move that's marginal when not placed handily on a humanoid; not to be confused with Immolate), I actually might. Explode is... a marginal move, at best. Its only purpose is pure spite, and for what it does its damage is quite low -- you would be better served by Ion Cannon, which does 125% of Explode's damage and you might actually survive using.<br /><br />Then there comes the question: Meteor Strike or Nether Gate? I answer this question with a question: Do you expect your Abyssal to go first? If you do, you get more value out of Nether Gate, since it costs the opponent their turn as well as doing high damage. The forced swap can also be a life saver if your opponent leads with a dragonkin (hey, dragonkin usually have pretty low speed...). If, on the other hand, you're going second? Meteor Strike is better damage. It comes with a turn of invincibility, though your opponent will expect it. If used on the same turn, the slower of two moves of this category wins... Say you Meteor Strike and a faster snake burrows on the same turn: The snake erupts from the ground and misses, only to get clobbered. It's a corner case, but that might be all the edge you need.<br /><br />All in all, a decent pet.</div>

Note: there is a debuff every time you leave a piece that forces you to wait a few seconds before jumping onto the next one. Watch for this and wait until its up or you will be clicking in vain!<br /><br />2. <b>Move the Pawns in front of the Knights</b> one space forward (<i>Press 1</i>). Move the Rooks (elementals/demons at the outer edges of the board) diagonally where the pawns used to be. This brings their AoE within range of the main battle area in the middle.<br /><br />3. <b>Move the Pawns in front of the King and Queen</b> pieces so that when Medivh cheats, you can move your King out of the fire. Note: always move him unless the enemy King is almost dead.<br /><br />4. <b>Jump on the Queen piece and melt the enemy King's face</b> (<i>Press 3</i>) until the match is over. If he's not within range right away, don't worry he'll come to you soon enough. Typically, you will move your own King out of the fire once and the rest of the time you'll be spamming the single target spell until he's down.<br /><br />5.
