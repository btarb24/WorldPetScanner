Don't bother running around underground to see if there are any above the bottom level with the millions of zombies, there aren't any.\r\n\r\nMy advice on the ghouls and zombies is that (at least at level 90) they are only a slight inconvenience in the form of a delay. They do no damage, and you can run across the entire room without aggroing 100 of them because they will only follow you for about 5 feet. DO NOT bother to kill your way through, just run through ignoring them and kill the few you have to that aggro you when you stop near the maggot. That saves a LOT of time since you'd have to be careful using AOE not to accidentally kill the maggots, too.\r\n\r\nI found that the maggots re-spawned very quickly, too. I'd check each one, forfeit when it was inevitably not blue, and then kill it and move on to the next. Doing this, the first one I'd killed was re-spawned by the time I got back around to it. \r\n\r\nHowever, despite finding the catacombs only mildly annoying personally, if you can't deal with it, these maggots spawn as secondary pets all over Howling Fjord.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>speedtycoon</b></h3>Trapped this pet when battling a Fjord Worg pup. It seems that you can trap it and also complete the Northrend Safari Achievement. But I didn't get the pet our the achievement. Seems to be something thats broken atm</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zeterai</b></h3>Caught one after a long, difficult grind killing everything that moved outside of Utgarde Keep's southern entrance.<br /><br />Then I found out that it does <b>not</b> actually show up as a pet in the journal. Searching through the list will turn up nothing even after you've caught it, and it's not tagged with the usual colour schemes denoting rarity, instead it's got an orange/yellow colour, but not the same shade as a Legendary so I think we can rule that out. It's just broken at the moment and doesn't complete the achievement.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>607101</b></h3>Found mine as a secondary pet, while battling a Maggot in Halgrind (Howling Fjord). Maybe Maggots have a higher chance to spawn them. After all, maggots stick together in real life. ^___^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1037343</b></h3>While I am, of course, having the same issue with the devouring maggot not being in the pet journal or counting for the achievement, using the little grub in battle does seem to allow it to gain xp. I am using the Pet Battle Teams addon, so I can go back and check the status easily. While the creature model remains whatever was in that slot (or the info panel) previously, the stats do reflect that of the devouring maggot.<br /><br />EDIT - The first time I used this little guy, I killed all 3 enemies with him (acidic goo + Leap tears critters apart) and the xp gain was clearly stated. The second time, I had to use a backup pet to finish off the battle and the xp did not report. Going into the pet journal, however, confirmed that he did indeed gain xp. I have noticed this in other fights with other pets. Just one of the many glitchy aspects of a new game mechanic, I guess.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dementron</b></h3>Much bigger than the other types of pet maggot. This thing could almost swallow a gnome. Well worth the trouble of catching and saving to a team, in my opinion.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>265695</b></h3>I've seen similar issues with several pets, and even after today's maintenance, they are all still bugged out.<br /><br />Hoping we won't have to catch them again later once they're unbugged.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ayuzawa</b></h3>After a very tedious grind of killing every Fjord Rat that spawned, at the southern entrance to Utgarde Keep, I finally had one show up as a secondary pet. Be sure to kill all the critters in the Utgarde Keep area to keep them spawning. :]</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JBonezzz</b></h3>I am currently farming for a rare in this little guy and have been running around the pool in the middle of Halgrind. There are three groups of 5 maggots that I have been battled or killed to clear and one of the groups will respawn as battle pets. The group by the trees at least for me has a bugged mob that seem to be in a tree so I slash target it and just kill it to clear it out. The Devouring Maggot seems to spawn as a secondary about half of the time but so far I have been unable to get a rare, good luck and happy hunting.<br /><br />Edit: Tried this again to get a rare but they seem to have changed them or they are bugged because I went through 4 sets of spawns and no Devouring Maggot spawned with them but something else strange happened. The spawns repeated, so that the first one I targeted for example was a Maggot (poor), Chicken (common), Frog (poor) then the remaining 4 were the same and the next 3 sets while different from the first repeated within their groups. So figured that they were bugged.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>918749</b></h3><i>This type of maggots mostly shows up as second or third pet in a battle.</i><br /><br /> I find it easier to grind the <b>Fjord Worgen Pup</b> for the Devouring Maggots, located on the <b>Kamagua Island</b> in Howling Fjord.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Schnoodledorfer</b></h3>You can find the Devouring Maggots among the <a href="/npc=24177/decomposing-ghoul">Decomposing Ghoul</a>s in the catacombs <b>underneath</b> Wyrmskull Village, just south of <a href="/zone=206/utgarde-keep">Utgarde Keep</a> in <a href="/zone=495/howling-fjord">Howling Fjord</a>. You will see the icons for them and you can /tar the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=24270">original critters</a> (particularly just southwest of the village), but you won't actually see them because they are underground.<br /><br />To get to them, look north at the south entrance to Utgarde Keep. There are three skulls, one high above and the others to the sides of the main entrance. Go into the mouth of the skull on your left (coords: 56.6, 49.5). A tunnel winds down and under the village into a huge crypt-like place. Keep working your way down (it's easy to find the way) until you find the Decomposing Ghouls and the Devouring Maggots. <a href="http://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/315389.jpg" rel="nofollow">This old screenshot</a> (by <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/user=Kurasu">Kurasu</a>) shows the room that they are in. A level 70s character shouldn't have much trouble getting to the room, but would find the room very difficult due to the large number of ghouls there.<br /><br />The page for the original (not battle pet) critters <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=24270">is here</a>. ATM Wowhead has the <a href="/achievement=2556/pest-control">Pest Control</a> achievement linked to this page, but it should link to the other one. (You will probably want to kill a regular critter while you are there.) The battle pets are a criteria for <a href="/achievement=6588/northrend-safari">Northrend Safari</a>, though. The battle pets were missing from the catacombs in 5.0.5 and could only be collected if they showed up as a second or third pet in a battle. This was fixed in 5.1.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Chibchub123</b></h3>Found mine as a secondary on The Isle of Spears when fighting Fjord Worg Pups. So it appears as though it's specific to this zone and not one small area, feel free to move around and challenge any pets. Maybe catch a few rares you didn't have in the process.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bukowskaii</b></h3>Got a rare one of these as a secondary to a Uncommon Turkey a bit south of Utgarde Keep, in Valgarde @ (59, 61). Uncommon Snake was the other secondary.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>853396</b></h3>I just got credit for and have it showing in my journal 1 common, 1 uncommon and one rare. I won a battle three days ago and got the common but as previous comments below said it did not show in my journal. There is a work around.....click on the pet in your chat line...and then click to see in journal when the box opens up. Put the pet from the upper view window into an active pet slot below. Then enter the pets name in the search box. It will be in your journal but not in the achievement box for Northrend Safari. Halfway there is better than not there at all i say.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vifor</b></h3>I got my <a href="/achievement=6588/northrend-safari">Northrend Safari</a> today... <br />I think I captured in total like 5 or 6 <a href="/npc=62640/devouring-maggot">Devouring Maggot</a>, with quality varying from grey to green, and none of them got the <a href="/achievement=6588/northrend-safari">Northrend Safari</a> corresponding part check. I even tried with another character from a different realm, but it didn't seemed to matter. So I got kinda frustrated, I abandoned the <a href="/npc=62640/devouring-maggot">Devouring Maggot</a> &quot;quest&quot; and I went for the last little guy on my <a href="/achievement=6588/northrend-safari">Northrend Safari</a> list: <a href="/npc=62815/biletoad">Biletoad</a>.<br />I captured one <a href="/npc=62815/biletoad">Biletoad</a> and surprise: <a href="/achievement=6588/northrend-safari">Northrend Safari</a> just popped on my screen, all items checked.<br />I hope it helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jeromic</b></h3>I found it as a secondary with Fjord Rat at 59/50 : )</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>975666</b></h3>as of patch 5.1 the can be found in the cave underneath utgarde keep. They are at the very bottom where all the ghouls are. so take a friend to clear them away from where you are battling.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>914170</b></h3>You can farm Devouring Maggots as 2nd or 3rd pet like other ppl suggested here until you die of boredom BUT you can also go down into The Utgarde Catacombs (entrance at 56.64 49.58) and get yourself a guranteed maggot..<br /><br />You have to go all the way down till you get to the watery area with the ghouls, clear some of the ghouls so you wont be interrupted and ta-da!<br /><br />One more thing- some ppl said it has to be rare quality but ofcourse its not. Any quality will count for these achievements.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Martika</b></h3>I have to say, when battling the ones in the catacombs, I had an unusually high instance of rares. My very first battle I had a rare Devouring Maggot AND a rare Rat which I sadly had to kill. On a hunch I engaged a second maggot and captured a rare Turkey. Third try, a rare Rabbit. If you don't have bandages it *can* be a bit of a pain to wait until you can heal between rounds, but for all these rares it was worth it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1031035</b></h3>if you caught on of these back in 5.0.5, you might need to catch another, as the first one may not be recognized by the achievement due to a bug back in 5.0.5. However, as soon as you catch another, the achievement will pop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1071299</b></h3>Might just be lucky but there were quite a few underground like Schnoodledorfer said....3th one i confronted was blue!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ner1</b></h3>Devouring a way right into your heart! (Literary)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cymre</b></h3>Definitely the best place for these were the Utgarde Catacombs - entrance at the base of the southwest side of Utgarde Keep (or north end of Wyrmskull Village). Follow the tunnel down (as well as the stairs) until you're on the lowest level with all the ghouls. You will find a few of these at any one time and they respawn fast enough if you're looking for that rare. <br /><br />The only hindrance is having to continuously kill the fast respawning ghouls but you can challenge these pets pretty easily if you stand under the stairs or towards a corner where the ghouls won't respawn much - it doesn't hurt to be a fast clicker though in these moments.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>plastisch</b></h3>I found one in the &quot;second row&quot; while i defeated worg puppets at the fjord.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1062573</b></h3>These Maggots spawn in the area under Utgarde Keep where there's a massive amount of undead mobs (this is associated with a quest area where you get a pulsing aoe that keeps the mobs away from you). They seem to be on their own personal respawn table, so if you keep pulling or killing Devouring Maggots, more will quickly respawn.<br /><br />The real gimmick to this pet is the fact that you'll be swarmed by very weak mobs (by level 90 standards) that practically force you to aoe, but aoe'ing will kill the critter. The best way I found to handle this: use a character that can stealth. With stealth at level 90, you can weave through the crowd pretty easily without aggroing anything and pull a Maggot. When combat ends, you'll probably be aggrod into combat and have to aoe once, but after that, stealth again and repeat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tsuzurao</b></h3>The entrance to the underground Utgarde Catacombs can be found at 56:49. However, since there are hundreds of zombies down there it may be difficult to start a pet battle. Just make sure you don't AoE like I did or you will kill all of them. Single target until you can clear an area for a battle.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Anamcha</b></h3>I got two as seconds for a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62641">Fjord rat</a>. Rather then dealing with the irritation of going down that tunnel just give a try with the battle pets above ground.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Heimdallen</b></h3>The entrance to the catacombs is indeed at 56, 49, and the maggots are found all the way at the bottom level once you're down there. Don't bother running around underground to see if there are any above the bottom level with the millions of zombies, there aren't any.<br /><br />My advice on the ghouls and zombies is that (at least at level 90) they are only a slight inconvenience in the form of a delay. They do no damage, and you can run across the entire room without aggroing 100 of them because they will only follow you for about 5 feet. DO NOT bother to kill your way through, just run through ignoring them and kill the few you have to that aggro you when you stop near the maggot. That saves a LOT of time since you'd have to be careful using AOE not to accidentally kill the maggots, too.<br /><br />I found that the maggots re-spawned very quickly, too. I'd check each one, forfeit when it was inevitably not blue, and then kill it and move on to the next. Doing this, the first one I'd killed was re-spawned by the time I got back around to it. <br /><br />However, despite finding the catacombs only mildly annoying personally, if you can't deal with it, these maggots spawn as secondary pets all over Howling Fjord. They even showed up clear across where the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62669">Fjord Worg Pups</a> are. So you don't have to deal with the catacombs if you really don't want to.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Warlock82</b></h3>These maggots respawn extremely fast. Just keep killing the non-battle pet versions and you can farm for a rare pretty easily here (especially if you have a way to stealth around the ghouls)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kaimaani</b></h3>Tried catching mine today, went to the lowest level in Utgarde Catacombs with my 83lvl mage. Yes the place is crawling with undeads but I stood in the corner of the room (left from the stairs) <b>dismissed water elemental</b> and killed the aggroed zombies <b>one by one</b> to avoid killing the pet and had time to engage it in a pet battle before the zombies spawned. And got a rare one too!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>896921</b></h3>I read the other comments here and caught my Devouring Maggot in the catacombs as other noted. It was a pain because of all the zombies walking about. I was always aggro-ing them, them having to take time killing them off before battling the pets.<br /><br />But I caught one by hugging the side of the room, so at least I didn't have to kill a whole mob.<br /><br />Later I found that a better, and much easier place to catch them is Westguard Keep. I was trying for days to catch a rare Turkey, and the Devouring Maggot showed up nearly half the time as the second or 3rd pet of a Chicken or Turkey. I caught 2 rare Devouring Maggots this way (but no rare Turkeys :-( )<br /><br />Don't bother with the zombies in the catacomb, go to Westguard and hunt fowl.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>raistlyn</b></h3>I have to say, pet battling down in the catacombs was the most interesting / entertaining time I've had thus far in pet catching. Usually it's just move from one to other pet in other zones, most of which are quite a bit apart. This one it's run around in a nest of zombies, make sure you kill all non pet maggots, which makes the pet maggots spawn VERY quickly, watch your AOEs, and enjoy the entire, &quot;I'm standing in a room full of zombies underneath a Norse castle, while the zombies wait oh so patiently for me to fight this maggot.&quot;<br /><br />I dunno, maybe it was more fun for me because I was a giant cat, and cats are easily entertained.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gypsycaine</b></h3>If you go to the keep, be prepared for constantly respawning zombies. They respawn QUICKLY. I went as a WL with a void walker and found a recessed corner and caught one that wasn't surprised by the horde of ghouls. That said, I wiped out the ones closest, attempted to not kill the pet (better said than done!) and clicked battle as the ghouls I had killed were coming back to life! Just 2 seconds more and I'd been in combat again.<br /><br />I brought a level 59. As a side note, don't try this on timewalking. I forgot it was on the first 45 minutes then the lightbulb came on!<br /><br />Good luck and good catching!<br /><br />Dee</div>
