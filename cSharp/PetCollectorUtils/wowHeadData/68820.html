Early Advantage still takes advantage of a healing enemy by itself doing bonus damage, and is the more overall reliable choice.  Either is, in my opinion, considerably better than the 3rd slot options for Celestial, Onyxian, Crimson, etc.\r\n\r\nHaving higher power also makes the self-heal a little stronger, and leaves the main portion alone of Tail Sweep hitting harder than a Celestial's Breath (even without the 2nd hit from going last).

I looked inside first, then outside, and to no prevail. I'm afraid this might be a pet who has a rarity similar to the Minfernal. <br /><br />However, if it is like the Minfernal than it should not be too hard to get. If you simply go and clear out all the critters around Felwood, and then camp the Minfernal spawn, it should be up in about 30 minutes. This could be the same with the Whelps. I'll try clearing out Tanaris and see what happens. Good luck guys!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Karadine</b></h3><s>I believe that the appearance of the rare spawn <a href="/npc=44767/occulus-the-corrupted">Occulus the Corrupted</a> (an Infinite dragon) outside the Caverns of Time also now triggers a spawning event for <a href="/npc=68820/infinite-whelpling">Infinite Whelpling</a>s. While this rare was alive and occasionally yelling emotes, the whelpling spawn rate when through the roof. Even with a few of us doing battles, there were more than enough spawns happening and especially respawns in the same spots, both outside and inside.<br /><br />The very moment someone killed Occulus, these fast spawns stopped. So if you see him up, you should probably warn people not to attack him.</s><br /><br />update: Hate to kill my own theory, but saw another spawn of Occulus, and there was no increase in whelpling spawns while he was alive.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>piekid</b></h3>So with a name like 'Infinite', you'd think this pet would be more common...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ayrianna</b></h3>Found a rare breed outside the caverns on my third try. The other two were common and uncommon. <br /><br />If you get (half power, half speed), throw it away. This pet relies on being slow to be truly powerful.<br /><br />At level 25, he was key to taking down all the Pandaria trainers. He'll be slower than pretty much all of the Pandaria trainers' pets, so he'll do double damage regardless of whether the opponent is Magic.<br /><br />By far my favorite pet. I wanted to name him Doctor, but that was reserved, so I named him Ten (any Doctor Who fans?).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pyxxie</b></h3>These little guys are such a pain. When I first read about them, I went looking around the Caverns with nothing but a scorpion here and there for two hours.<br /><br />I hop on the next day and they were all over the place (Well, the Caverns of Time. I think the map above is inaccurate.)<br /><br />I'm not a rare battle pet fanatic. I grabbed mine, who happened to be Uncommon, and bolted. <br /><br />He put up quite the fight, mind you. That heal is aggravating. But he was definitely worth it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Koshut</b></h3>they are pretty common outside of the CoT also i found a few in the Caverns so you should fly around till you see one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1065844</b></h3>I finally caught one after unintentionally killing 3 in my pet battles inside the CoT. I was told by a WOW tech they are super rare, and that they only spawn in sandstorms. It makes them difficult to find and capture. I do not know if this is true or not, but it would make sense if it is. It's definitely worth ur time to catch if u are a battle pet fanatic and collector.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sissycortina</b></h3>This may be entirely coincidental, but as I was doing my daily fly over of Caverns of Time I spotted a rare infinite dragon <a href="/npc=44767/occulus-the-corrupted">Occulus the Corrupted</a>. At this time there were also about 15 infinite whelplings there. I think that when the rare spawns, the infinite whelplings spawn as well. Out of all the whelplings not one was rare, so I had to settle for an uncommon, but I'm happy to have him. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>496978</b></h3>At level 25, Infinite Whelpling has noticably less health than similar-use Celestial and Onyxian types, but much higher Attack and Speed (though the higher Speed is generally not beneficial here).<br /><br />All 3 have a similar usable moveset of 1 basic Dragonkin move, 1 self-heal, and 1 3-ish-turn cooldown nuke. I prefer Infinite though, as Moonlight weather can backfire if the enemy team has more/better healing, and Lift-Off misses too often (Deep Breath isn't bad but you may as well have just used 2 Breaths or Tail Swipes and not telegraphed the move).<br /><br />Early Advantage, in my experience, will offer many chances to inflict high damage (especially after a KO where you generally have an injured Infinite vs a full-health enemy AND the Dragonkin racial buff up), though Darkflame is no less usable to substantially weaken pets who rely on a self-heal to persist (like other commonly-used Dragonkin). Early Advantage still takes advantage of a healing enemy by itself doing bonus damage, and is the more overall reliable choice. Either is, in my opinion, considerably better than the 3rd slot options for Celestial, Onyxian, Crimson, etc.<br /><br />Having higher power also makes the self-heal a little stronger, and leaves the main portion alone of Tail Sweep hitting harder than a Celestial's Breath (even without the 2nd hit from going last). Sleeping Gas' base power is just too low to rely upon.<br /><br />Currently my favorite Dragonkin to use, and can make itself a reliable staple in many teams.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wazdakka</b></h3>These appear to spawn in front of the Caverns of Time, as well as in the area with the instances. The cave part of it and outside the ruins in front appear to be devoid of these. Someone stated that they have a 10 minute respawn timer - from what I've seen, while sometimes considerably longer or shorter, the average of 10 minutes makes sense.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Feathers</b></h3>Caught a green in my first battle, and went on to grab all eight other spawns looking for a rare in my completely empty zone before it occurred to me that it might be a timed/rare spawn. Whoops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1069128</b></h3>Actually, I would not completely debunk the suspicion that the Occulus the Corrupted spawn may be linked to the spawn rate of the Infinite Whelpling. I myself was camping for this and there were none around for a long time, then I got the npcscan alert that Occulus spawned and immediately there where several Infinite Whelplings. I know that this is not always the case, but it could be that the Occulus spawn has a 50/50 chance to spawn the little guys, or something similar to that effect. They do have the same skin as Occulus as well. Anyways, I just went through each one by one and went from normal, to uncommon, to rare. <br /><br />So it may be worth having Occulus on your npcscan to get your attention to check for the whelplings during his spawn. I was surprised that it happened since I just read these comments, and it motivated me to make an account and say something. Good luck to all!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1068569</b></h3>In days of hanging around CoT I've only seen one of these, poor quality, and I accidentally killed it. Maybe it's just rarer on different servers? Possibly because of high pop and over hunting.</div>

He is a level 13 battle pet and once you capture him you also have to kill pet behind him or else you do not get the capture. If anyone wants to no good battle pets to use against him I used the infected squirel you get in eastern plaguelands or you can use strand crab from stranglethorn both can heal themselfs.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>593337</b></h3>Since there are no mobs in the area that these spawn, you can run a level 1 alt to the Caverns of Time to camp the spawns.

I came to the outside of CoT today, Nov. 25 2013, and there were no fewer than 8 hanging around outside. See screenshot (if it gets approved).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bantoh</b></h3>Just grabbed mine today, 12/2/2013 at 10:33am. Got crazy lucky only one spawned in on the path leading down to CoT and was a rare. Didnt see any others through out the area though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Phasha</b></h3>The best breed for this pet is P/P (4/14), or 341 power at level 25 rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zenshu</b></h3>Just snagged one of these little guys right beside the broken tower in the ditch to the right hand side if you are standing in the cavern opening looking out towards tanaris. Went looking for one and flew down into the cave then came back out and parked ontop of the broken tower to tab over here and research the spawn timers and locations to see if it was worth hanging out and checking a few other places before I moved on and when I tabbed back over there he was by my feet and what luck he was a rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>IMissThottbot</b></h3>I love this li'l guy (named mine Inexorius). I farmed until I got a blue one; he's the full Power breed, and manages to make short work of most pets. With his slower speed, the Tail Sweep is devastating; his heal (especially when timed after a hard hit) is very powerful. Either of the abilities for the last slot are great, depending on what you're fighting.<br /><br />I'm no pet battle expert, but with this pet, I don't need to be. I've not had to level more than a handful of pets to defeat everything pre-Celestial Tournament, which I haven't tried yet, and this pet's been in the team each time. He always more than pulls his weight.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>daaani</b></h3>Got mine today, 5.4.14 at 15:10. One was on the path leading down to CoT.<br />Are they supposed to be as rare as the used to be?<br />And would they have same abilities and hit points if they were turned Rare as when they were found as Rare?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Slaskvatten</b></h3>This pet is incredibly good, my rare one OBLITERATED three pets that were all 3 leves higher than itself. Powerful.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Slaskvatten</b></h3>At high levels this can absolutely OBLITERATE pets, it turns it's weaknesses, like slow speed, into an attack that deals more when it's slower, and if it's low on health just use the &quot;Early Advantage&quot; and you're good to go.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Silvansaria</b></h3>Just got my rare of this one...<br />2nd fight.<br /><br />I was actually going to Dragon Soul - and I saw it pop up on my radar so I figured what the hell. The first one I fought was a grey with a friend - equally as worthless. But I captured it anyway thinking maybe I could upgrade it later. Then afterwards I saw another one just outside pop up on the radar so I went to go try that one...<br /><br />Rare...<br />Now I just need to level it to 25...<br /><br />They're pretty awesome looking as a pet and a little companion pet as well when you're cruising around...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mosstone</b></h3>It's things like this that make me wonder if the infinite dragonflight are actually sha-corrupted. That being said, this is an adorable pet :D</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cjxsutton</b></h3>Do these no longer exist or what? I have a toon parked by the caverns of time entrance and I check constantly. Haven't even seen one at all, EVER. Fly all around the area and down into CoT.<br /><br />I check all throughout the night and day - I was able to get an Emerald Proto-Whelping, and a Nexus Whelping, but still can't even spot one of these things.<br /><br />Can someone verify they are still available? Like seriously.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>maxflat</b></h3>I parked my Demon Hunter alt in the caverns and checked back several times a day for several days and never saw a single one. Created a Death Knight on the lowest pop Americas server Tol Barad Brazil and there were swarms of them. Picked up one of each breed and there were about 20 left. Did not kill any hunting for rares, I like to leave them for other people.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>hawkeyes</b></h3>There's a whole flock of them at around 63.2 50.6 on Khadgar Realm</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cstober2010</b></h3>Well, who doesn't like a nice surprise? Over the years I've made countless trips to the Caverns of Time. I've never seen anyone with this pet, and I've never seen it in the caverns until just now lol. I was flying in, saw this baby and swapped to 2 lvl 13 pets as quickly as possible to capture it. It looks like this was the only one up at this time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kiyoine</b></h3>Not to be confused with the new pet <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=143953/infinite-hatchling">Infinite Hatchling</a>, which is buyable on the Timeless Isle while the MoP Timewalking dungeon event is active.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Damonra</b></h3>For those looking this pet, he's in the Caverns of Time in Tanaris.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wruen</b></h3>Went looking on Alleria (low pop realm, but merged with low pop Khadgar for a total of about 500,000) and found a few very late at night. followed the advice of some of the other comments and made a DK on Tol Barad and there are a ton of them there just about any time of day. Twice, I've been killed by an opposing faction member, but it only sucks when you haven't entered the cavern since the graveyard is on the other side of the mountain. I've been able to get a rare of each breed without any trouble.<br /><br />One thing worth mentioning, if you're taking a port to the Caverns, it puts you just inside the entrance. Turn around and walk out first. Most other people probably just head down in and see if they see them, but they also spawn in the area just outside of the entrance. There was one time when I went all of the way to the dungeon entrances and saw none, but went outside of the Caverns and saw 15 (literally) just hanging out. Same for Minfernal and the Arcane Eye outside of Karazhan. This server is a gold mine for rare spawn/highly farmed pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Husttin</b></h3>Logged at different times 3 to 4 times today on Nemesis and Azralon<br /><br />Didn't find a single one.<br /><br />edit: Turns up it just wasn't showing the green thing on the minimap for wtv reason. Just pay attention to the screen.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Steelhammer</b></h3>I logged into abandoned toons in servers I dont play anymore, went to Gorefiend server and found a ton of them, even got a rare and 2 greens</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Currently</b></h3>Found tons on a low population server immediately outside the entrance. Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Grammie</b></h3>been looking for weeks but today I found them - server time 11:00 am...there were six...I killed four and then managed to save two...yeah for me</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Angelhearth</b></h3>Just caught a Power, even though it isn't listed as available.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zarilla</b></h3>Outside Caverns of Time at 5:31 Server time. Staghelm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>elkagorasa</b></h3>Wanted one for <a href="/achievement=10699/infinitesimal">Infinitesimal</a>, so had mage port to <a href="/spell=49359/teleport-theramore">Teleport: Theramore</a> and fly down to Tanaris entrance for the Cavern of Time zone. Found at least 10 different whelplings to try capturing. All level 15 and had one other local join. Most were rated poor quality but found a common. Had both my <a href="/npc=63365/terrible-turnip">Terrible Turnip</a> and <a href="/npc=84915/molten-corgi">Molten Corgi</a> and a third just to clear the second so that I could get 2 opportunities with low chance of killing it. Captured 4 of them with hopes of putting at least one on the AH.</div>
