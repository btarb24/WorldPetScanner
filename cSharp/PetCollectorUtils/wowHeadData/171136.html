<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Snuggly</b></h3>Deliver me some love, my Dal!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DragonsAfterDark</b></h3>Maybe this has something to do with Penkle, the dredger behind the building next to Edgar the Collector. Once you defeat Edgar, go behind the crypt he's next to before he despawns, and speak with Penkle. He'll give you a key to open the cage next to him which releases a Carved Fiend. Nothing happened after that, but it might be a beta thing, as some pets/pet items aren't even learnable at this point.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lazey</b></h3>To be able to get this pet, the WQ <a href="/quest=60655/a-stolen-stone-fiend">A Stolen Stone Fiend</a> has to be active in Revendreth. Basically you will use a <a href="/item=180249/stone-fiend-tracker">Stone Fiend Tracker</a> to search for a missing Stone Fiend, free him several times and finally end up defeating <a href="/npc=170201"></a>.<br /><br />As mentioned by <a href="https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/npc=171136/dal#comments:id=3221219">DragonsAfterDark</a> don't leave on WQ completion but immediately speak to <a href="/npc=170189/penkle">Penkle</a> behind the building to get a dialogue option to receive a <a href="/item=180270/cage-key">Cage Key</a>. This key is supposed to unlock the cage next to Penkle to receive <a href="/item=183859/dals-courier-badge">Dal's Courier Badge</a>.<br /><br /><i>Beta Notes:<br />The key had no effect on the cage when I completed the WQ. I kept it in my bags and next time the WQ was up, I ignored it and immediately went to the cage and was able to unlock it. The key acquisition itself seems to be tied to the last step of the WQ. I didn't get the dialogue option when defeating Edgar without tracking down the Stone Fiend before. No surprise... the new key also didn't affect the cage.</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vaugn</b></h3>This quest just came up on live - NA. I was able to finish the quest, find the guy behind the building, and received the pet as an item in my inventory upon unlocking the cage.<br /><br />I then told a couple of other people finishing the quest about it. They came around, got the key, but were unable to unlock the chest. My guess is they need to wait for the now-freed little guy to respawn back in the cage. I dunno how long that takes, but as of a few minutes later he was still standing outside it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Crestafore</b></h3>If you completed the world quest but missed getting the pet you can still get it afterwards while the world quest is up.<br /><br />Kill <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=170079/edgar-the-collector">Edgar the Collector</a> once again and immediately talk to <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=170189/penkle">Penkle</a> (/tar Penkle), and you should see the dialog option to get the key.<br /><br />Like other commÐµnts mentioned if you can't unlock the cage try to switch to a different shard. Most common groups in the group finder are 'blanchy' and 'famu', try to look up those and hop there. I switched 2 times until I found a cage I could unlock.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Surreall</b></h3>Couldn't find a loc anywhere... finally found Penkle in Revendreth at 45.30, 47.84</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Yzengrimus</b></h3>Even after deleting the key and getting a new one, I still can't open the cage. I am &quot;too far away&quot;. I hope this gets fixed before the WQ expires &gt;.&lt;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wypnrth</b></h3>I was not able to open the cage last week, swapping realms multiple times did not help. I kept the key, tried it this week, didn't work. I deleted the key, did the quest again and still not able to open the cage. I submitted a bug report but do not have any high hopes. Guess I will keep trying each time it's up until this is not bugged.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Suzaku</b></h3>Still bugged on December 16, 2020. Cage seems to have an inordinately long cooldown after one person uses the key to get the pet. Swapping shards until you find one where it's off cooldown does work, but it took me about a dozen attempts before I found one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>WillowZombie</b></h3>How are you supposed to fix this when I've been to literally every server hop channel with it phasing the cage so I know it's working and yet it keeps saying out of range when I use the key from my bags and when I simply click on the cage nothing happens :(? I have submitted a ticket along with the rest of my raid group and my husband as well all of whom the cage is bugged for. We've all tried the server hopping stuff separately and nothing is working :| Any suggestions? Husband tried deleting his key as well but that did not help either :|</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wypnrth</b></h3>The wq is up again today for the third time I've seen and once again the cage key does not open the cage. Keep getting the error &quot;Out of range&quot;. I tried realm hopping again but after multiple tries I am still not able to open the cage. I have submitted yet another bug report, have opened a ticket and will keep it active until hopefully someone answers or forwards to the right team to fix this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Melandroso</b></h3>Today, the world quest was up right after server restart and the first cage I tried worked. So if you are having issues, keep an eye out for when the quest is up soon after restart and get there quick before the cage bugs out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shashos</b></h3>Fourth time this WQ has bugged out for me. I submitted a ticket in hopes they'll just give me Dal so I can put myself out of my misery and no longer bang my head against the unclickable cage. :p<br /><br />Edit: No luck. Got a ticket response today that they can't help with quest completions and bugs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>coldwinter18</b></h3>I was able to find an unbugged cage by realm hopping. My server (Silvermoon) had a bugged cage so I tried to search with the words &quot;Gorge - Harika - Blancy - Famu&quot;, and I found an unbugged phase with the 4th try</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Slapthat</b></h3>My friends and I saw the post about this pet and decided to try and go get it when the world quest spawned just now.<br /><br />Don't do this in a group, one person was able to open the cage and two others were not able to afterwards. I ended up jumping shards and luckily found one where I could open the cage and get the pet but as of right now, this still seems to be bugged.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>schnizol</b></h3>The server hop works as of Dec 31,2020 but I needed like... 30 or so groups :0</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xracmo</b></h3>As of right now Iâ€™ve done 50 plus sever hops and itâ€™s still not working</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Toenail</b></h3>been trying different shards many times. it's always &quot;out of range&quot;. tried killing Edgar a couple times too. also tried with all addons disabled.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Machista</b></h3>Still not working, tried realm hopping, nothing...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Magewow</b></h3>Sad. 1/5/21 <br />I had my key from last time the WQ was up, tried server hopping about 5 times. No luck. My key will not open the cage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kadetkat</b></h3>So try #1, didn't work, tried all the suggestions. Try #2, kept the key from last time, did the WQ up until killing the guy (checked and the key still didn't work, tried hopping into some famu groups etc). Still didn't work, killed the guy, went back and my key worked. Hallelujah moment. Don't give up!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>NelleRavencrest</b></h3>The World Quest just popped in EU, best of luck guys.<br />Report back if it works or not this time around.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Frozgul</b></h3>For all EU players : WQ is up today !<br />On completion, head behind the building and talk to Penkle to take the key.<br />Open the cage next to him and be rewarded with the pet :)<br />Tested it now and it works !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wevah</b></h3>I guess the name + flavor text is a reference to Chip &amp; Dale.</div>
