It looks like people that wanted this when it first came out will get their wish and keep this. Course it would suck if it was only usable during the event like it is currently.<br /><br />Edit: Looks like its no longer in the Pet Journal. Hope one day it can be since <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=66636">Nearly Headless Jacob</a> has <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=66618">Stitch</a><br /><br />Edit #2: As of Patch 5.4. This is now a permanent pet! So go for it and have fun :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>627828</b></h3>I'd say now that its on the Pet Battle list, mixed with people demanding this pet year round ever since its introduction, that next day of the dead we'll have the chance to finally keep the little fella.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zharshoul</b></h3>anyone else? ill say it.. finally.. an undead pet with a humanoid ability ... a hard dragon counter.<br /><br />Not sure if there was any others but this was the first one I really noticed.<br /><br />Just double checked all the undead battle pets on warcraftpets there is another option in the plagued whelp but the call darkness is on cooldown and the dreadful breath requires cleansing rain for max damage. Marionette inflicts far more damage on a single target.<br /><br />Make sure to get one or three. I do not believe they are unique.<br /><br />And yes as others have posted.. years after this was an event.. finally this little fella is permanent.</div>

A little annoying but I was looking forward to getting him so much that it doesn't extremely bother me.
