<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gerodash</b></h3>I had serious issues even finding one of these guys. However after flying around for 25 mins or so I found several at 41.62, 71.28 (Kota Basecamp). They were at the base of the mountain and I just found a rare, along with it was a rare Alpine Foxling and of course I need both of them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>squiretoad</b></h3>Just saw my first Summit Kid by the big wall near Kota Peak .. and he was a Rare! (Lucky me. I've been looking for hours for a Mongoose Rare!). He wasn't on a mountain side or ridge, but down in a little valley right by the wall! (We're talking to the East of Kun-Lai Summit.)<br />Easy fight, no problems or surprises. Well, with 3 25's stacked up to make sure I got him and killed the other two as well :-)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Imanomnom</b></h3>I've been trying to find a rare quality Summit Kid, and I found that the best and least frustrating spot to actually get into the battle with one of them is : the area where <a href="/npc=68563/kafi">Kafi</a>(the legendary goat from Beasts of Fable) stands. They spawn pretty frequently and no issues with 'This pet battle area is obstructed' Goodluck :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Khoom</b></h3>They don't appear to show up as secondaries</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rainsford23</b></h3>The <b>&quot;area is obstructed&quot;</b> has nothing to do with the placement of the potential pet. It has everything to do with where you stand. <br /><br />Try to stand at the edge of any location where a battle could take place and then try to engage the Summit Kid. The Summit Kid and you will be moved to fit the fighting location you are standing on. <br /><br />I have rarely, if ever, encountered a battle pet I couldn't fight - including Summit Kids. (Though the stupid robo-chicks between the wall and buildings in Everlook have thwarted me so far.)<br /><br />Good hunting all!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ns88</b></h3>Not cageable because.......?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Guanyin</b></h3>Soothe &gt; chew &gt; stampede is one lethal combination.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1223209</b></h3>You can go find bunch of these guys around <a href="/npc=68563/kafi">Kafi</a><br /><br />The area is plain, so you won't have any problem with 'Pet battle area is obstructed'</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BlameTheBird</b></h3>Just stumbled across a Summit Kid. It was a rare and I had never seen one, so I came here. Guess I got lucky with the rare and the fact that it fought me on the 1st click. I was at coordinates (34.1, 74.3) at Kota Peak when I fought it. The pets that I had on me at the time were Disgusting Oozeling (19), Warbot (25), and Oily Slimeling (25). They were all at full health. The fight was really easy using these battle pets, so I won't even bother listing the fight strategy. I was able to capture the Summit Kid (1st attacker) and then kill the other two without really worrying about dying, and even getting some reputation for my level 19 Oozeling. If you run across one of these and can attack it, go ahead and go for it. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sunjiang</b></h3>To save time and spare yourself from frustration, consider capturing a non-rare version and using <a href="/item=92741/flawless-battle-stone">Flawless Battle-Stone</a>, <a href="/item=98715/marked-flawless-battle-stone">Marked Flawless Battle-Stone</a> or <a href="/item=92675/flawless-beast-battle-stone">Flawless Beast Battle-Stone</a> to turn it into a rare.</div>
