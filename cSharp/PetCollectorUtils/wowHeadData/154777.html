In case anyone else was as confused as I was, I'll try to explain where I found mine and where is the best place to find them inside and outside of the instance. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, you want to make a general [b][i]\/tar Yellow Junkhopper[\/i][\/b] macro. You can use it flying around outside and looking near pools of water but personally, this macro was helpful in the instance. \r\n\r\n[b]INSIDE THE DUNGEON:[\/b] As soon as you enter the Mechagon dungeon, you want to use the target macro. There's a couple of places that the Junkhopper can spawn and a fair few of them will get you instantly killed when you leave the \"safe area\". In [url=https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/LuqkKxG.png]this image[\/url] you can see where I managed to catch my Junkhopper and finish the achievement in a place safe enough to avoid being obliterated. If you see the pet spawn somewhere else in the dungeon outside the safe zone, I'd suggest just going back outside and resetting -- there's honestly no point in getting yourself wound up trying to avoid dying. \r\n\r\n[b]OUTSIDE THE DUNGEON: [\/b] You can fly around the circumference of the island checking pools of water for the pet like I did for the last two weeks but it barely got me anywhere. From what knowledge I've managed to gather, [url=https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/mckaB2s.png]this[\/url] seems to be a favourable spot to camp the Junkhopper. There's other frog pets in this area so you'll need to kill them (NOT battle them!) in order to hopefully force a Junkhopper spawn. This way is far easier as you'll definitely get the first spawn that pops up and you're stationary, so you can watch T.V or a movie or something whilst you sit and camp for it. This is what I'd be doing between resetting the dungeons.\r\n\r\nI hope this helped and lessened some of the inside\/outside dungeon confusion.

Doing the research, I started going into the instance (doing the reset each time) and every ten or fifteen times I would indeed see the yellow junkhopper on the beach which almost due north of where you enter the instance as an alliance player. The only nice round bay to the north and very clear on the map. I would be vaporized each time (for leaving the instanance zone) well before I could reach the yellow junkhopper. Started trying various things on various alts with no results. The only comment I saw of any use was that someone tried various objects that speed up your mount like a tuft of Yak fur and the like. The comments otherwise were pretty cryptic and mostly useless and only added to the frustration. I imagine the fast mount would work too but not what I ended up doing. In my case I was trying my hunter and just before I was going to be vaporized I hit feign death. Worked like a charm. I just laid there until the warning that I am going to be vaporized faded away and was able to just walk over to the pet and do the pet battle and finally, finally get that last pet I needed for the achievement.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Samanthers</b></h3>I was starting to think this was bugged, but no, it's just SUPER rare. It took me 3 hours of killing Fleeting Frogs to make one spawn. <br /><br />I recorded many (but not all) spawn points of the fleeting frogs. I'm pretty sure all the ones I skipped were very near points already listed. <br /><br />In my experience it's not worth it to circle the island. I mostly focused on the west side of the map. There's two spawns in a pond as well as two or three on a hill just above it. Then you can go down the side of the coast and hit the four spawn points on the left. <br /><br />The horde is up by the top right of the map so the NPCs stun you a lot. I didn't find it to be worth it to farm up there. <br /><br />It's probably worth it to make a macro, and I made sure to kill the fleeting frogs critters too. I'm not 100% sure it helped but it seemed like it did.<br /><br />/way 79, 42<br />/way 79.5, 37.6 <br />/way 85.5, 32.5 <br />/way 77.4, 22.4<br />/way 84.4, 59.1<br />/way 34.6, 82.25<br />/way 34.3, 79.7<br />/way 33.8, 76.87<br />/way 37.6, 45.9<br />/way 46.3, 36.6<br />/way 47.7, 37.3<br />/way 46.23, 30.6 <br /><br />ETA: I just noticed while taking a screenshot of him to upload, he has a cute animation where every 15 or 30 seconds or so a fly starts buzzing around and he eats it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rizz020</b></h3>Definitely the rarest of the meta. Took me about 2.5 hours of circling Mechagon to find one. Personally I found it ok to visit every spawn point and exterminating all fleeting frogs from the island as I went as their respawn time is a few minutes and the whistle takes you to the start of the circuit.<br /><br />I was well chuffed it was a blue too :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kailea</b></h3>got finally one after few hours on the south-west beach 36,76 where only frogs spawn.Anti-Gravity pack from the Armory construction was a big help for me as it allowed me check spawn points - fly over the isle pretty fast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Volleynova</b></h3>Got mine at /way 78.7, 42.3<br /><br />Took me about 30 minutes of circling the island killing Fleeting Frogs hoping they would trigger a respawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SarmaticuS</b></h3>finally, got mine after 2 and half day in<br /><br />/way 79.5, 37.6</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mehetabel</b></h3>I found this the hardest of the rare counterparts to track down. <br /><br />I tried two different tactics. Firstly, I spent a couple of hours camped on that small patch of beach at /way 34 77 killing all the fleeting frogs that spawned, critters and battle pets alike. The spawn rate was really slow though so after about two hours I gave up on that. <br /><br />My second tactic was to circle the island. Starting at Sparkweaver Point, near /way 73 18 , I ran clockwise around the coast of the island, going inland at The Fleeting Forest beach, /way 39 35 , and cutting across the island back to Sparkweaver Point. I spammed a target macro and killed any fleeting frog battle pets that I saw. After about an hour and a half one eventually spawned right where I'd originally been camping, at /way 34 77.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>skotwstra</b></h3>Got mine at 34.6,82,2 after killing about ~170 of the fleeting frogs. Use anti-gravity jetpacks if possible and use group finders to realm hop would be my advice.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>chanpa</b></h3>There is a great path between the NW lake and the SW beach. There are a lot of spawns along it.<br /><br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/6HaGLag.png" rel="nofollow">Path</a><br /><br />A has at least four spawns, two on the upper side and two on the lower.<br />B has at least 3 spawns.<br />C has at least 3 spawns.<br /><br />I just rode along this route and spammed a <br />/tar Fleeting Frog<br />/tar Yellow Junkhopper<br />macro and killed all the fleeting frogs pet/critters.<br /><br />I would suggest having NPCScan (add a custom NPC with id 154777) or something similar set up to alert you when the Yellow Junkhopper spawns so you dont kill it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>shoxi</b></h3>I did not have to fight a <a href="/npc=154775/fleeting-frog">Fleeting Frog</a> to get this, this spawned on its own at 64.50, 28.94 and it was a rare!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sochibear</b></h3>So feign death is an ability this pet can have.<br />I nearly had a heart attack.<br /> I had been looking for 2hrs. And I thought I killed it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sarthorius</b></h3>If you spent a lot of time trying to see one on all the main island, try killing the <a href="/npc=154776/fleeting-frog">Fleeting Frog</a> and <a href="/npc=154775/fleeting-frog">Fleeting Frog</a> at<b> 34.5 80 (southwest corner of the main island)</b> and wait for the respawns. Keep killing until this rare one spawns. <br /><br />The area is pretty much isolated from other people, not much stuff there to do, and most people just pass by, while getting to the smaller isles. Was the last one I had left to get the achievement and completed the Naga baby one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ArgentSun</b></h3>I found that camping the one inside <a href="/zone=10225/operation-mechagon">Operation: Mechagon</a> (it's where the Alliance camp is in the non-instanced version of the island; the Horde camp is inaccessible inside the dungeon) worked far better than the running laps around the island strategy - got my Junkhopper after only about 5-6 resets. compared to the 3+ fruitless hours I spent flying around Mechagon, killing all sorts of frogs.I could've gotten lucky, but now that the dungeon is open, I would recommend taking a few minutes and trying it. In my attempts, I also saw a <a href="/npc=154769/duskytooth-snooter">Duskytooth Snooter</a>, another rare pet needed for <a href="/achievement=13693/mecha-safari">Mecha-Safari</a>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bearistic</b></h3>Can confirm operation mechagon is still working. got it after my third reset, found him by the water at alliance camp.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Limelime</b></h3>After about 15 hours of killing Fleeting Frogs and at least 60 Mechagon resets I found it in the world at 46,36. I really think this is one of the rarest world battle pets in the game.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TheSwauzz</b></h3>Three frog spawns happen at around 34, 70 (southwest edge of main island) all within yards of each other. I camped this single spot, killing every Fleeting Frog as I server hopped using the spare parts farm groups. Found one within 15 minutes.<br /><br />Before that..<br />I spent 3hrs flying around the island, server hopping, killing Fleeting Frogs, trying to find a spawn.<br />I spent 10 resets of Operation: Mechagon trying to find a spawn.<br /><br />I finally came here and realized I was leaving a certain area out of my circuit that others have mentioned.<br /><br />If the way you're going about farming this doesn't seem to be working, change up your farm spot or tactic and don't drive yourself crazy camping it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AlicePrime</b></h3>Mechagon resets (dungeon) are STILL the only reliable way to get it. Each reset has about 2% chance to get you the frog in Alliance beach camp. You can make several attempts at once, but the number of instances is still limited.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shelassa</b></h3>After wiping out all the fleeting frogs for a few hours, I listened to the rest of the comments on this page and decided to catch this pet through repeatedly resetting the Operation: Mechagon dungeon. It took me about 15 resets (out of them, 13 were devoid of all pets, and one had the other rare-ish pet - <a href="/npc=154769/duskytooth-snooter">Duskytooth Snooter</a>). <br /><br />About an hour later, I and a friend had found a <a href="/npc=154777/yellow-junkhopper">Yellow Junkhopper</a> around coordinates 47.8, 37.6</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pwuebear</b></h3>Finding these inside Operation:Mechagon still works as of this post. Spawned after 13 resets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>NeroRain</b></h3>So, some notes.<br /><br />- The method of entering the dungeon and looking on the beach for pets still works as of 2019-08-07.<br /><br />- It seems VERY RNG dependent.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Deathope</b></h3>IF YOU'RE CONFUSED WHY YOU'RE BEING VAPORIZED BECAUSE YOU FOUND ONE INSIDE MECHAGON..<br />I was confused too, but not only do you have to HOPE it spawns, you also have to hope it spawns at the instanced version of the Alliance camp. If it spawns at the Horde one? You simply cannot seem to get to it. Vaporize works through immunities even :( <br />You can target it from the entrance so you dont actually need to run off unless it picks up on the Junkhopper <br /><br />I've been trying several methods of obtaining this, and sometimes luck simply isn't there. If you're outside I highly advise you farm along the west coast of the Island (NOT going to where Freza/Paol/Seaspit are. You want to start at 36, 81 and work your way up to 47, 29. <br />Make a macro (or two, I prefer to have them separate for inside the dungeon)<br /><br />/tar Yellow Junkhopper<br />/tar Fleeting Frog<br /><br />If it pops with a fleeting frog, kill it!

I had one set up to target both it and the fleeing frogs, and in the end when I finally found a Junkhopper the macro didn't tag it. I found the frog inside Mechagon dungeon on about the 10th reset, and remembered there usually being 2 of the fleeing frogs. When my macro only spotted one, I checked the other site to see what was there, and THAT is how I spotted the Junkhopper. Keep a sharp eye out!<br /><br />And fair warning: it feigns death to swap out teammates. I about screamed the first time I thought I'd killed it after farming so long!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>arthas28zp</b></h3>I must share my experience to save you a headache. I have wiped out many many frogs with no luck. I have entered the Mechagon instance so many times in a row that I received the message &quot;You have entered too many instances recently.&quot; In the attempts I made in the dungeon I saw the same Mechagon Marmot non battle pet critter on the way to the Alliance beach whereupon I found the same two Fleeting Frog non battle pet critters. I never saw anything different or any battle-able pets in any of the dungeon instances I tried two days in a row 4/9/2020 and 4/10/2020. Happy Good Friday and good luck! <br /><br />UPDATE: I CAUGHT ONE FINALLY! Make sure your dungeon setting is set to normal. I made the switch yesterday right before I received the too many instances message. I saw a battle pet on the map on my very first entrance on normal mode so I knew right away that it is possible to battle pets on normal mode. After 6 or 7 resets I got my <a href="/npc=154777/yellow-junkhopper">Yellow Junkhopper</a> finally! It's a rare H/P. I may go back again and try for more because in the backline there was another rare pet I didn't have - a <a href="/npc=154781/copper-hopper">Copper Hopper</a>. Again, good luck!</div>

And i got it in the dungeon - outside where you get vaporised! <b>'How'</b> you may ask? A simple item called <a href="/item=153123/cracked-radinax-control-gem">Cracked Radinax Control Gem</a>.<br /><br />This pet is a real pain in the soft cushions, i tell you. I resetted the instanced way over 50 times to get my first Yellow Junkhopper - just to kill him with a crit by accident ..<br />So i started from square one and started resetting again. Some times there was a Yellow Junkhopper in the instance, but not in proximity to catch it because you couldn't reach it and get vaporized before that. You simply <b><u>can't</u></b> get the other Hoppers except the one at the beach because that's what wowhead told me and many others <br />- <b><i><u>or can you actually get them?</u></i></b><br /><br />I started experimenting with certain items and classes (f.e. using a Monk with <a href="/spell=115008/chi-torpedo">Chi Torpedo</a> and <a href="/spell=101545/flying-serpent-kick">Flying Serpent Kick</a>), but nothing worked out. Then I remembered the item from Argus: The <a href="/item=153123/cracked-radinax-control-gem">Cracked Radinax Control Gem</a>. This item can be used in instances and even raids! A Yellow Junkhopper was sitting at 85,31. From my several tries before i knew where the countdown starts ticking down and used the <a href="/item=153123/cracked-radinax-control-gem">Cracked Radinax Control Gem</a> a little before that. So i lunged towards my missing pet piece full throttled - and reached it! To my surprise the countdown was even cancelled when i reached the pet! I could just walk around on the island without being vaporized.<br /><br />So there it is! Use <a href="/item=153123/cracked-radinax-control-gem">Cracked Radinax Control Gem</a> or <a href="/item=89770/tuft-of-yak-fur">Tuft of Yak Fur</a>(don't know if it works though) and break through the sound barrier of Mechagon!<br /><br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/v3jq0F3.jpg" rel="nofollow">PROOF!</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gameroze</b></h3>So many of these comments are very helpful... but the only problem is not many of them are concise about whether the Junkhopper was found <i><b>in</b></i> the dungeon or <i><b>out</b>,</i> thus leading to a lot of head scratching. In case anyone else was as confused as I was, I'll try to explain where I found mine and where is the best place to find them inside and outside of the instance. <br /><br />First and foremost, you want to make a general <b><i>/tar Yellow Junkhopper</i></b> macro. You can use it flying around outside and looking near pools of water but personally, this macro was helpful in the instance. <br /><br /><b>INSIDE THE DUNGEON:</b> As soon as you enter the Mechagon dungeon, you want to use the target macro. There's a couple of places that the Junkhopper can spawn and a fair few of them will get you instantly killed when you leave the &quot;safe area&quot;. In <a href="https://i.imgur.com/LuqkKxG.png" rel="nofollow">this image</a> you can see where I managed to catch my Junkhopper and finish the achievement in a place safe enough to avoid being obliterated. If you see the pet spawn somewhere else in the dungeon outside the safe zone, I'd suggest just going back outside and resetting -- there's honestly no point in getting yourself wound up trying to avoid dying. <br /><br /><b>OUTSIDE THE DUNGEON: </b> You can fly around the circumference of the island checking pools of water for the pet like I did for the last two weeks but it barely got me anywhere. From what knowledge I've managed to gather, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/mckaB2s.png" rel="nofollow">this</a> seems to be a favourable spot to camp the Junkhopper. There's other frog pets in this area so you'll need to kill them (NOT battle them!) in order to hopefully force a Junkhopper spawn. This way is far easier as you'll definitely get the first spawn that pops up and you're stationary, so you can watch T.V or a movie or something whilst you sit and camp for it. This is what I'd be doing between resetting the dungeons.<br /><br />I hope this helped and lessened some of the inside/outside dungeon confusion. Good luck on your achievement guys!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dragoress</b></h3>i Just went into the Mechagon Dungeon and found the Pet multible times, but it was on the Horde Camp which was inacessable because you die after the 5 Second Timer runs out. <br />So i did it like that as a DH: <br />i used a Speedpotion + Netherwalk and Metamorphosis afterwards and i reached the Pet before the countdown ended. i could click the Pet for the fight and didnt die until the fight was done and i caught the pet. The Countdown started again after i finished the fight.<br /><br />Its important to note that the pet can spawn farther away too (you wont reach that one in 5 seconds) so dont try this method on the farther spawn. The pet i got stood near the Bridge where you normaly enter Mechagon as a horde.</div>

If you start the battle with 1 second to the lightning, you will die, if you are fast enough, after the battle start animation is over, you WILL stay in the battle and can capture the pet.</div>

Couldn't get a Yellow Junkhopper to save me, so I got out of the dungeon, flew around to the SW corner of the island, shot three Fleeting Frogs, and waited. The first re-spawn was the YJ, and it was of Uncommon Quality. So, perhaps a mix of Dungeon/Regular Island may work for you as well. Good luck, and happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Detection</b></h3>After circling the island in both warmode &amp; non-warmode, comitting mass genocide on the Fleeting Frog population, one finally spawned.<br />Uncommon H/P breed. <br />7:19pm EST <br /><br />Finally got my mecha-safari achievement.<br /><br />(I was not pet battling the fleeting frogs, just slaughtering every single one I came across.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>aharie87</b></h3>As others have said, this is a rare spawn that shares a spawn with Fleeting Frog. I ran around the perimeter of the island, over the water, for about 3 hours, killing non-battle pet Fleeting Frogs and battling Fleeting Frog battle pets, before I got the Yellow Junkhopper to spawn. It spawned in the area with the elite lvl 60 goblins. I skipped this area a few times around, since I didn't want to waste the time fighting the elites, but it only took one pet battle and 2 passes of killing critters for the rare to spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Heckler</b></h3>Mechagon Heroic method still works (5/31/2021). I zoned in and killed all the fleeting frogs around the instance gate, and some minutes later a Yellow spawned in their place. The battle pet icon will show up on your mini-map if it is the Yellow spawn. Also, I found one out in the Kill-zone and even if I clicked it in time, I still died. Not sure if that's fixed or I was just doing it wrong.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>diablojohnson</b></h3>So, I was very frustrated by trying to get the yellow junkhopper which was the last pet I needed for the achievement. I tried flying around the island and spent hours doing the grind with no luck. Doing the research, I started going into the instance (doing the reset each time) and every ten or fifteen times I would indeed see the yellow junkhopper on the beach which almost due north of where you enter the instance as an alliance player. The only nice round bay to the north and very clear on the map. I would be vaporized each time (for leaving the instanance zone) well before I could reach the yellow junkhopper. Started trying various things on various alts with no results. The only comment I saw of any use was that someone tried various objects that speed up your mount like a tuft of Yak fur and the like. The comments otherwise were pretty cryptic and mostly useless and only added to the frustration. I imagine the fast mount would work too but not what I ended up doing. In my case I was trying my hunter and just before I was going to be vaporized I hit feign death. Worked like a charm. I just laid there until the warning that I am going to be vaporized faded away and was able to just walk over to the pet and do the pet battle and finally, finally get that last pet I needed for the achievement. It was so easy it was a little disappointing (but only a very tiny little bit). So glad to have this done. Hope this helps many.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Traumfrau</b></h3>I found my Yellow Junkhopper at 34/80, Toothy Shallows on Mechagon. I killed the Fleeting Frogs only in this area until a Yellow Junkhopper spawned. The Fleeting Frogs were not battle pets, only critters that you could not battle so don't fly to this area and leave because you don't see any Fleeting Frogs you can battle. I fished in between killing Frogs and after about 25-30 minutes a rare Yellow Junkhopper spawned right on top of me! Ecstatic! I tried so many different methods that were recommended here and this was the only one that worked for me. I think I killed about 10 Fleeting Frogs in total. Good luck with your farming!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jorsha</b></h3>Just wanted to post that you can still get this one, but it took me several days and I was beginning to think it was bugged. I killed every fleeting frog I saw on the island and it never spawned. I finally found one in the dungeon, but it probably took about 20 resets. In those resets, I only saw pets 3 times, 1 snooter, 1 cockroach and then finally the yellow junkhopper. He was down on the Alliance beach. Definitely go the dungeon route. If you have pet tracking on you can see if one has spawned on the beach when you zone in. If not, exit, reset and try again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Marklyft</b></h3>I combined the methods, I ran the instance, ran towards the eastern beach where there are two frogs, they can spawn as the yellow junkhopper, never did to me though. When I had done the 10 instances per hour (you reset it if they aren't your yellow junkhopper on the beach) I did laps around the island. I found my Yellow Junkhopper 36.47 on the island.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>fortncookie</b></h3>spawned between 11-11:20 am in the Operation Mech Dungeon on the alliance beach. I went through 2 resets of the dungeon. After exiting dungeon found another on the horde beach and called a friend to get. Within 20mins a Duskytooth Snooter appeared on the horde beach after killing Rustytooth Snooters in the area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Viserion</b></h3>I found one in Operation: Mechagon seemingly out of reach. However, I managed to get past the deadly zone (engineering belt + double blink + night fae ability). I think most classes can't do what I did, but I was wanted to post this info: you can get to that seemingly impossible Yello Junkhopper, you just have to be very, very fast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tracykay13</b></h3>For those looking for the Yellow Junkhopper in the Mechagon dungeon - there's almost always one by the horde flight point, however, this is NOT the one you're looking for! It's outside the bounds of the instance, and you'll get vaporized before you can actually reach it to battle it. It's impossible to get. <br /><br />The one you want is by the Alliance flight point, and you do need to run down there to see if it's there. It's not like the dusty rootsnooter where you can see it when you enter the instance. You have to run down there to see if the Yellow Junkhopper is actually there. <br /><br />Hope this saves someone some frustration, can't tell you how many times I was vaporized :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Romullus</b></h3>It's very possible to get to the one that spawns in the vaporizing zone near the Horde flight point in Operation: Mechagon. I did it just now as a night fae warlock - soulstoned myself, ran as far as I could while mounted, then popped back up and immediately hit my night fae sprint and was able to enter the pet battle before getting zapped again. Hope this helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ryshenron</b></h3>Just got one using the dungeon reset method. <br /><br />Entered Operation: Mechagon on heroic and checked the Alliance FP area. The first 3 times I only saw two attackable fleeting frog CRITTERS(not battle pets). On the fourth reset, one of these spawns was the yellow junkhopper.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mvelasco</b></h3>After 5 rounds of killing the fleeting frogs around the island, the yellow junkhopper appeared on 33, 76.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Muppetman50</b></h3>So the entering the instance trick still does work in 10.0.5, BUT I also needed to use my hunter to be able to reach the other beach part. Normally you get targeted and destroyed, but you can feign death through this to then reach the little fella.<br /><br />I think I probably reset the instance 20 times - so persevere!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Inkjoy7</b></h3><b>GOT ONE!<i></i></b><br /><b>Alliance Character</b><br />With my alliance character (My Main), I read all the strategies and comments. I tried for quite a while, spending 2-3 days with several hours each time, several months apart in my efforts, flying around and trying to find one, getting annoyed and bored and leaving Mechagon. I tried to do the instance trick, but was never sure where to go, and never saw one in the instance. I still don't really know where people are talking about, so some actual cord would be nice, if anyone knows them.<br /><b>Horde Character</b><br />I decided to try my horde character, to see if that one could get further before being vaporized...and if not, Oh well. I did the instance trick, still not sure where other people were saying that I should try to go, and never even saw a battle pet in the instance, let alone a Yellow Junkhopper. After 10 tried, and resets, I flew about the island, hoping one might appear. Other people said it did for them...after a bunch of Instance In/Outs and Resets. Nothing! So, I went in and out of the instance, on heroic, another 10 times, resetting each time. No pets of any kind. One last flight about Mechagon Island NOT in the instance, no pets, and then it was bedtime, and I went forthwith.<br /><b>Finding Nemo!</b><br />Today I logged in and thought I'd do a flight around the Island and see if one popped up, and then do some more instance resets. I needed to level some pets for another pet achievement so I fought one team of things, Snooters and things, and then another team, clicking on a Fleeing Frog. <br />MAGIC! WONDER! MYSTERY!<br />The first pet in the battle was a RARE YELLOW JUNKHOPPER (H/P)!<br />I was so afraid I would kill him! He kept feigning death and scaring me, but I caught him!<br /><b>Achievement Met.</b><br />The only thing that I could say that could help others (other than to let you know A: I got one! and B: They are still actually catchable) is that I logged on during a time of day I never play, that is, in the morning. I caught a Sithilid Hatchling, a pet that only spawns during a sandstorm, and only sometimes then, by logging on at a time I do not usually play. So possibly some twisted evil person at Blizz has decided to make it all the more fun by only letting you catch one when it is outside your normal behavior pattern. I know if I were an evil genius, such a thing might occur to me...Are we having fun yet!<br />So just keep at it...they still exist!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lannvouivre</b></h3>I have spent hours over the course of the past two days flying around Mechagon killing the poor fleeting frogs trying to get a yellow junkhopper to spawn. Well, I was doing my route and noticed that the name of the frog I'd just frost shocked into TES: Oblivion wasn't quite right. It wasn't shaped like Fleeting Frog.<br /><br />...Oh. Because it was a Yellow Junkhopper.<br /><br />I want to die.<br /><br />Well, I ended up making a weakaura just for checking my target to alert me when I'm targeting a yellow junkhopper. It's on wago:<br /><a href="https://wago.io/Ytq7BFq-7" rel="nofollow">Target Name/ID Scan Audio Alert</a><br /><br />The default unit is this frog.<br /><br />EDIT: BTW don't forfeit if you start the fight with the wrong pets. Because it turns into a fleeting frog when you exit the match.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aonyx</b></h3>For anyone trying to get the pet from inside the dungeon, <a href="/item=191353/potion-of-frozen-fatality">Potion of Frozen Fatality</a> can be used to get around the instant-kill mechanic in case the pet spawns outside of the safe zone. I had it spawn on the Horde beach around 73, 20 on my 15th reset. After a few attempts of trying to get through the kill zone, I found out that using the potion right before the debuff reaches 0 allows you to avoid being killed. I was able to safely reach the pet afterwards.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Madmartigan666</b></h3>I found one at 87.42, 72.47 area of the dungeon. Doesn't matter if you enter the pet battle, if you get the debuff you'll get vaporized. Very annoying. It was rare too -_-<br /><br />Saw an Experimental Roach down in that area as well. The macro /tar Yellow Junkhopper worked from quite far away so use that macro to see if you have any in your instance and quickly hop out and reset as everyone else mentioned here.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zecmo</b></h3>Just found mine at /way 47.50, 31.50 <br />In the pool that becomes a waterfall in the Mechagon Island zone, NOT the instance.<br />I post bc I have not seen any comments about it spawning in that location.<br /><br />While in WarMode (though I do not think this matters), I had been flying up and down the west coast.<br />Slaying, not battling, any Fleeting Frogs I saw.<br />I gave up and was heading back to town for a break.<br /><br />Very surprisingly, I happened upon it.<br />After a careful and glorious battle... Yellow Junkhopper joined the family.<br />Really hope this helps someone. Was not a fun one to find.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LumiyaSpellsong</b></h3>Just confirming that <b>you can still catch the Yellow Junkhopper within the Mechagon dungeon in 2023</b>, just as mentioned in previous comments. <br /><br />I reset 10 times, got &quot;locked out&quot; (10 instances an hour limit) for a bit, went to the west coast location and killed Fleeting Frogs until my hour limit was up, then went back in and it probably took 6-7 more dungeon resets (so 16-17 total) to see a Yellow Junkhopper on the beach behind the dungeon instance portal, around /way 79, 37<br /><br />As others recommended, I used a <b>/tar Yellow Junkhopper</b> macro and hit it as soon as the dungeon loaded to save time. It will target a Yellow Junkhopper on the beach, even if you can't yet see the green battle pet paw on the minimap.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pentarion</b></h3>I had 70 resets of the instance done and still no spawn in the dungeon (had seen plenty of experimental roaches and duskytooths), while I waited for my 10 instance per hour limit to reset I did laps of the island using co-ords below (killing fleeting frogs as I went), ended up finding a Yellow Junkhopper on the horde beach at 73.69, 17.84.<br /><br />There is no longer any reason to just farm them in the south-west part of the map as this island is deserted and other players won't be taking spawns, so you might as well fly around killing all fleeting frogs and then re-checking them after respawns.<br /><br />A combo of the dungeon and open-world seems to be the best approach.

A very kind player who was also looking for it let me know he had found one in the dungeon but could not reach it because the lil bugger had spawned near the beach party- which is certain death. poor guy had been looking for one for quite a while and had no way to get to him without the debuff killing him. <br />Lucky for me, i am a hunter. If i FD i can engage with the frog.<br /><br />Frog force swaps with a blue roach. Did not have a critter killer prepend for my &quot;kill robot pets and gently weaken my main target&quot; team.<br />Apocalypse.<br />I can't risk taking 15 rounds of tanking waiting for this to go off, i need to kill the bug.<br />Roach become unkillable last second- dragging things out. <br />frog comes back in. Becomes catchable. time is running out.<br /><i> force swaps in a different pet. </i><br />time is running out. i have been looking for this stupid frog for a while. i beat the death debuff for this. Its low enough to trap <i>but it keeps swapping! </i><br />Three rounds to apocalypse. No time left to kill this rando pet it swapped in. i'll just have to tank this random pet so the frog wont get hit.<br />Try to go underground with my turnip in hopes of my pet surviving. Its not super effective and shouldn't do much damage. <br />somehow.... the attack managed to K.O the trash pet.<br />Frog moves to the front of the line.<br />Apocalypse kills it instantly. <br />fml.</div>
