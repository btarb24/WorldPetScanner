The undead king from Diablo 3, has an ability that lets him automatically resurrect wherever he dies. If you park him somewhere with a lot of enemies, he dies, respawns, auto attacks, dies, respawns, etc, which means he circumvents the AFK kick timer. Meaning you can just start a Beginner A.I. game, ferry him over to the enemy's base in his undead form, and leave him there while you go off and play WoW or do something else. Check back in 20 minutes or so and you've usually won and gotten some 60-90k experience. If you'd like you can also be a little more active and have him kill the enemy minion waves or something, but the point is that he's really low maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe bad part is, if he's not up on the daily rotation you'll have to buy him for 10,000 gold. I did daily quests, and leveled the daily rotation of heroes to level 5 for the 500 gold bonus, to be able to afford him. When I could afford him I was around level 12 already, and had the level 10 Stimpack experience bonus, which allowed me to get to 20 in two days of [i]reeeeeally[\/i] lazy playing.","date":"2015-11-07T10:38:57-06:00","rating":13,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Thank you!

He came as level 1 rare with 163 health, 13 power, and 8 speed. I leveled him up to 25 where he has 1668 health, 314 power, and 211 speed. I have been facing him as an opponent in more and more PvP pet battles recently, and am still working on a team to beat him. At least now, I can have him on my team for a change.\r\n\r\nI played HoTS game only to get my Graves pet, but found that I did enjoy the game in small doses. Especially when I found the hero I liked to play the most - Sgt. Hammer. I also liked to play Tychus and Raynor, but this is all up to your personal preference.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to spend any real money in this game in order to obtain your pet, because you will earn gold along the way and can use it to pay for your favorite hero so you can use him or her whenever you want.\r\n\r\nIf you want to speed up your progress you can pay US $4 for a 7 day \"stim-pack\" which doubles your experience gained per battle. You can alternatively get a 30 day stim-pack for $10.\r\n\r\nI wanted to answer a few questions I have seen in here.\r\n\r\nQ] When does this promotion end?\r\n\r\nA] I do not know, but I imagine that if you have already started your effort to get to level 20 in Heroes of the Storm, that you will have plenty of time to obtain that goal. I also guess that even if you haven't played HoTS that you still have some time to do so.\r\n\r\nQ] How long does this take to get to level 20?\r\n\r\nA] It varies depending on how much you play and what method you use.\r\n\r\nI took my time and it took 2 months. I would play casually a couple, 3 or maybe 4 times a week for 2 to 5 games per session. More than 5 games in a row and I got burned out. Two days in a row and I got burned out.\r\n\r\nPlay one game, then do something else for a bit, then come back for another.\r\n\r\nThe two primary methods of playing the game are:\r\n\r\n1] You plus 4 other real people team up against 5 artificial intelligent opponents.\r\n\r\n2] You plus 4 artificial intelligent team mates team up against 5 artificial intelligent opponents.\r\n\r\nI started playing with method 2 at first because it allowed me to get comfortable with playing the game without having to cumber other people and to learn the basic mechanics. Later I only used method 1 because while playing with other people, we never lost a battle.\r\n\r\nOne big advantage to method 2 is that you can pause the game by hitting the escape key. It turns real time into pseudo real time. You can't pause using method 1. Another advantage is that you do not have to wait in a que, but that is almost trivial because even at the oddest hours of the day my que times were always less than 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nAlso to matter is your level of difficulty.\r\n\r\nI always played this game in \"Adept\" level of difficulty. If you play at a higher level, you stand to gain more experience, but you also raise your chance of losing a battle.\r\n\r\nA typical battle takes about 14 or so minutes. A quick battle can be completed in 8 minutes and a long battle could take more than 23 minutes. This has to do with skill and randomness.\r\n\r\nYou get more experience if you win a battle than if you lose.\r\n\r\nIt takes more experience to get to the next level than the previous level. This means that when you reach level 10, you are not half way to getting to level 20. You cannot reach level 10 and say \"Cool - I'm half way there\", realistically you are probably more like 1\/3 of the way there.\r\n\r\nDaily or weekly quests can earn gold and are for example something like this:\r\n\r\nWin 3 games.\r\nPlay 5 games.\r\nPlay 3 games as a Specialist Hero.\r\nPlay 3 games as a Diablo Hero.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, the objectives can overlap, so you can, for example, play 3 games as a hero specialist, 3 games as a Diablo hero, win all 3, and played 3 of the 5 games. If the Diablo hero is a hero specialist it counts as both.\r\n\r\nQ] Why bother to level a particular hero or several heroes while they are available during the free rotation?\r\n\r\nA] Don't bother unless you find a hero that you like better than the one you like most. The only benefit to leveling a particular hero is that at key levels you can gain global benefits. For example, raising a particular hero to level 5 gives you 500 gold.\r\n\r\nIf you play a hero that is free to play during the rotation and like her a lot, then save up enough gold and pay to unlock that hero.\r\n\r\nGood luck on getting your Graves pet, you are going to like him a lot!","date":"2016-03-04T23:36:21-06:00","rating":20,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":61,"id":2322015,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Thannya","body":"I like pets, collecting them since I started playing WoW.

Wtf?\n\nSo lvl and a half for me, and I think this game won't see me ever again....","date":"2016-04-14T14:52:14-05:00","rating":12,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"I'm sorry to hear about your travails getting Graves.

If you have a bunch of heroes, just level them up to 2, or 3, depends on how many you have. If you only have a few heroes, try to spread it out. For example: level each one to 5 or 6.\r\n- Concentrate of objectives. Let your AI team handle the enemy heroes. Objectives help the match go faster and it seems like which team does them is the one that wins.\r\n\r\nIt's very important to either level a Hero to 10 to get the free 100% exp boost or just spend the $5 and buy it. To me this grind was horrid slog and I wanted it over pronto.","date":"2022-07-10T07:47:43-05:00","rating":3,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":89,"id":5554438,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Jeanssi","body":"Still obtainable as of 24th Feb 2023.

Beside the many anti-player in-game policies in WoW like FOMO (limited time achievements, events, pets, etc), now they force players to spend hours in a unlikeable game. \nThe best way to level up is to play with AI team vs AI team. If you play with real players, the duration is increased quite a lot (que time, games last way longer (even 25-30 min), etc). \nFor the AI gameplay you need: \n\n-You need 7 heroes at lvl 3 each hero level will give you one account level, the level required to unlock this pet, aka you need acc level 20. \n- I don't know without exp boots because i bought it from start to reduce the time, but with exp boost you need to do 3 matches with each hero to level it to lvl 3, but without boosts i guess you multiply by 2 the requirement.\n- Each game last between 12 to 15 min(sometimes 17-18 min), depending the map and how bad your allied AI is (yes the allied AI is very bad)\n- Always play on easiest difficulty, for some reason on the highest difficulty the allied AI is very bad and the enemy AI is very good (it's almost like you would play vs real players). I tried a few games on highest difficulty and i lost all of them and they lasted longer (17 to 20 min). \n\nNow the math: let's assume you're lucky and each game last 12 min (but usually they are 14-15 min) you need to play 21 games multiplied by 12-15 min = a average of 270-300 min = 4-5 hours. Without boost this time is doubled and also the number of games needed to play. \n\nThis is especially frustrating for players who never played moba style games and have no clue what they need to do. To force a player to play a game that he might not like for 10 hours it's ridiculous.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>alpanhell</b></h3>The explanations on this page are pretty terrible. People just trying to be first to post with no clear explanation given.<br /><br />Basically you have to get your &quot;player&quot; to 20. This doesn't mean get a hero to 20, this means your player (kind of like representing you and not just one hero). It's going to take quite awhile, definitely not as easy as Hearthstone was. I spent a good 6 or so hours playing and got up to level 5.<br /><br />I play against AI but with &quot;real&quot; random teammates (don't select AI teammates). I've found if I use AI teammates I lose a lot (like pretty much all the time) for some reason. the higher you get the more matches it takes to go up a level.<br /><br />I don't really like this game much, but I do want the pet so I guess I'll just keep grinding.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kanariya</b></h3><b>EDIT: This is Pre-2.0 Heroes information. The Player Level system has been significantly revamped since this comment.</b><br /><br />I haven't noticed any comments about how long it takes to get this pet, so I'll leave my personal experience. <br /><br />I received this pet today after reaching Player Level 20 today in HotS. It took me <b>47 games played</b> to reach this level with a Stimpack and the bonus holiday features (100% additional XP &amp; 25%/50% from the holiday week bonuses occuring as of this comment). About 10 of these games were played with a friend (50% additional xp), and 12 were played vs AI (a substantial XP loss, avoid this).<br /><br />Each game lasted an average of 20 minutes, so it took almost <b>16 hours of played time</b> to get this pet. If you stick to Quick Matches only, you won't need to play as many as I did. I highly recommend a stimpack (remember, you get one 7-day stimpack free for getting to Level 10), and if you have a friend trying to get the pet as well, group up whenever possible. Even a loss grants a high amount of XP.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MRTF</b></h3>I've got to admit. Heroes of the Storm was quite tempting even before the pet.<br /><br />To have WarCraft, StarCraft &amp; Diablo + the Lost Vikings! All in 1... It was just a matter of time till the awesome games &amp; their famous heroes/villains joined together to create something unbeliavably epic!<br /><br />Seriously I fell in love in the game. It's similiar to Dota or HvsA (a WC3 custom online game) etc.<br /><br />The characters have very interesting abilities, suited for various playstyles and the possibilities the game has is near endless!<br /><br />You can go PvP if you feel good with the hero you've chosen or play vs AI for more relaxing gamestyle or training.<br /><br />Idk, I went straight for PvP and it wasn't really hard at all to keep a good 1:1+ K/D ratio while focusing on the main goals of each map.<br /><br />I noticed that a good connection is essential since if you &quot;spam click&quot; in the game; it gets slow due to various commands in a short time.<br /><br />I'm definitely heading for the ladder ranks, to see how impulsive the game can get. I suggest people to really give it a 1 good try. <br /><br />PS. I hope to see more promotions for WoW from Heroes of the Storm. I give Graves 10 grades out of 10! For the motivation :)</div>

Festering Maggot - Sticky goo + chomp and it's GG for graves.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BJRubino</b></h3>Just got this guy today; it is a long grind. It took me 80 games to build-up to level 20.<br /><br />FYI, Blizzard is running a Holiday Bonus event which gives 50% extra XP.<br /><br />Good luck...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bonorum</b></h3>One tip for lazy Heroes of the Storm levelers like me: Leoric. The undead king from Diablo 3, has an ability that lets him automatically resurrect wherever he dies. If you park him somewhere with a lot of enemies, he dies, respawns, auto attacks, dies, respawns, etc, which means he circumvents the AFK kick timer. Meaning you can just start a Beginner A.I. game, ferry him over to the enemy's base in his undead form, and leave him there while you go off and play WoW or do something else. Check back in 20 minutes or so and you've usually won and gotten some 60-90k experience. If you'd like you can also be a little more active and have him kill the enemy minion waves or something, but the point is that he's really low maintenance.<br /><br />The bad part is, if he's not up on the daily rotation you'll have to buy him for 10,000 gold. I did daily quests, and leveled the daily rotation of heroes to level 5 for the 500 gold bonus, to be able to afford him. When I could afford him I was around level 12 already, and had the level 10 Stimpack experience bonus, which allowed me to get to 20 in two days of <i>reeeeeally</i> lazy playing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mongrolman</b></h3>Best words of advice on how to get to lvl 20<br />1- stay in AI mode, takes too long in queue when you group with people. I could get a game in for a bunch of xp by the time the group actually got in... then... when playing others you are NOT guaranteed a win. AI mode = WIN <br />2- stay on beginner AI mode- great XP all the way to 20 - I was getting about 140k per game (13min duration)<br />3- the 7 day stimpack at level 10 is a lifesaver. Make good use it<br />4- Only use one hero. Best one IMO is Tychus- two buttons needed- Q and W. Melee get eaten alive all the time<br /><br />I did try other hero's during the leveling. Valla, Gazlowe, Illidan, Cho/Gall, Raynor.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />Look for me on Bleeding Hollow Horde side - ElÃ³him top 20 pet collector on server</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thewhoracle</b></h3>Agh this is such a grueling grind. I do enjoy the game at least, but really didn't think it would take so long. Good news. I am level 10 now. And I unlocked Cho'Gall, and I am getting mad EXP. How much longer is this event going on?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ender111</b></h3>In the current meta, this pet is simply too powerful. There is no downside to using him. Even with sandstorm up, his moves pack too much of a punch. Small wonder, though, now Blizz is promoting HotS... makes me sad, though. With fragment, graves and some other undead pet, Graves is too silly to allow unnerfed in the game.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zakaryyxo</b></h3>In the legion alpha, Blizzard has concurred that this pet is far too powerful along side being an undead (racial)<br />'Tis quite a shame, but, Clobber and Bonestorm will swap places.<br /><br />Also - the base states will change.<br />&quot;At level 25, Graves' Speed will now be 244 (was 211), Power will now be 297 (was 314), and Health will now be 1587 (was 1668).&quot;</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>iIIumnati</b></h3>I finally reached level 20 with Heroes of the Storm and received my pet on March 4th, 2016. He came as level 1 rare with 163 health, 13 power, and 8 speed. I leveled him up to 25 where he has 1668 health, 314 power, and 211 speed. I have been facing him as an opponent in more and more PvP pet battles recently, and am still working on a team to beat him. At least now, I can have him on my team for a change.<br /><br />I played HoTS game only to get my Graves pet, but found that I did enjoy the game in small doses. Especially when I found the hero I liked to play the most - Sgt. Hammer. I also liked to play Tychus and Raynor, but this is all up to your personal preference.<br /><br />There is no need to spend any real money in this game in order to obtain your pet, because you will earn gold along the way and can use it to pay for your favorite hero so you can use him or her whenever you want.<br /><br />If you want to speed up your progress you can pay US $4 for a 7 day &quot;stim-pack&quot; which doubles your experience gained per battle. You can alternatively get a 30 day stim-pack for $10.<br /><br />I wanted to answer a few questions I have seen in here.<br /><br />Q] When does this promotion end?<br /><br />A] I do not know, but I imagine that if you have already started your effort to get to level 20 in Heroes of the Storm, that you will have plenty of time to obtain that goal. I also guess that even if you haven't played HoTS that you still have some time to do so.<br /><br />Q] How long does this take to get to level 20?<br /><br />A] It varies depending on how much you play and what method you use.<br /><br />I took my time and it took 2 months. I would play casually a couple, 3 or maybe 4 times a week for 2 to 5 games per session. More than 5 games in a row and I got burned out. Two days in a row and I got burned out.<br /><br />Play one game, then do something else for a bit, then come back for another.<br /><br />The two primary methods of playing the game are:<br /><br />1] You plus 4 other real people team up against 5 artificial intelligent opponents.<br /><br />2] You plus 4 artificial intelligent team mates team up against 5 artificial intelligent opponents.<br /><br />I started playing with method 2 at first because it allowed me to get comfortable with playing the game without having to cumber other people and to learn the basic mechanics. Later I only used method 1 because while playing with other people, we never lost a battle.<br /><br />One big advantage to method 2 is that you can pause the game by hitting the escape key. It turns real time into pseudo real time. You can't pause using method 1. Another advantage is that you do not have to wait in a que, but that is almost trivial because even at the oddest hours of the day my que times were always less than 30 seconds.<br /><br />Also to matter is your level of difficulty.<br /><br />I always played this game in &quot;Adept&quot; level of difficulty. If you play at a higher level, you stand to gain more experience, but you also raise your chance of losing a battle.<br /><br />A typical battle takes about 14 or so minutes. A quick battle can be completed in 8 minutes and a long battle could take more than 23 minutes. This has to do with skill and randomness.<br /><br />You get more experience if you win a battle than if you lose.<br /><br />It takes more experience to get to the next level than the previous level. This means that when you reach level 10, you are not half way to getting to level 20. You cannot reach level 10 and say &quot;Cool - I'm half way there&quot;, realistically you are probably more like 1/3 of the way there.<br /><br />Daily or weekly quests can earn gold and are for example something like this:<br /><br />Win 3 games.<br />Play 5 games.<br />Play 3 games as a Specialist Hero.<br />Play 3 games as a Diablo Hero.<br /><br />In this manner, the objectives can overlap, so you can, for example, play 3 games as a hero specialist, 3 games as a Diablo hero, win all 3, and played 3 of the 5 games. If the Diablo hero is a hero specialist it counts as both.<br /><br />Q] Why bother to level a particular hero or several heroes while they are available during the free rotation?<br /><br />A] Don't bother unless you find a hero that you like better than the one you like most. The only benefit to leveling a particular hero is that at key levels you can gain global benefits. For example, raising a particular hero to level 5 gives you 500 gold.<br /><br />If you play a hero that is free to play during the rotation and like her a lot, then save up enough gold and pay to unlock that hero.<br /><br />Good luck on getting your Graves pet, you are going to like him a lot!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thannya</b></h3>I like pets, collecting them since I started playing WoW. But I really don't like the fact that I am &quot;forced&quot; to play other game so much in order to receive it.<br />I don't like HoTS. Reaching lvl 5 in it, would be perfectly fine for anyone to see whether they like the game or not, if Blizz wanted people to try it. But this lvl 20 is torture....<br />I will probably reach this damn lvl 20 eventually, but I already hate HoTS, and I believe I won't use Graves in WoW because of the way I got it. :D<br /><br />So, I have to add this to my general disappointment and anger about the way I can obtain this pet; I am on lvl 18 now in HoTS, and not proud to say, most of them I was half afk - as much as the game lets me. But, what is even more irritating is that some games I was clicking around the map, doing almost nothing, attacking fences and gates and for defeat I was awarded 122k XP. <br />And then, a game or two after, I busted my ass in playing, trying to contribute as much as possible, and it was a good game for all five of us, and we won, and I got around 90k xp. Wtf?<br /><br />So lvl and a half for me, and I think this game won't see me ever again....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bahaled</b></h3>Since the Launch of HOTS 2.0 this guy this ridiculously easy to get so the grind is OVER. I was trying to get him pre HOTS 2.0 but since every level you got increased the XP you needed per level the higher levels needed for example 6 wins to level, then 7, then 8, etc... Now however all you need to do is raise a character level by one to gain a level. So you can raise all your Twenty FREE from the promotion champions or any hero in the free rotation to level 2 with one or two games. I went from level 13 to 20 this way in around 11 games MUCH easier than the additional fifty+ games the previous system required.<br /><br />It may not matter since this guy has apparently been nerfed but he's so adorablely cute it doesn't matter to me! Plus as a fanatical pet collector well, I gotta catch 'em all right?</div>

Awfull playstyle, skills, concept,everything. No wonder HoS became a failed game and Blizz abandoned it.

This happens when you try to change completly a genre and reinvent it.<br />Lvl 3...after 8 matches... still many to farm to get the pet.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Splinterverse</b></h3>I can confirm this still works as of Sept. 20, 2019 and patch 8.2.<br /><br />It does not announce in game (HotS) that you have completed it, but the next time you login to WoW, you have an unopened pet item.<br /><br />It is faster to level 20 characters to level 1 than to try and level them higher. Take advantage of the starting XP boost (which lasts for 7 days) and play a few matches each day. I played all AI matches and they lasted from 15-25 minutes each.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>peterwooley</b></h3>Still obtainable as of August 10, 2020. I had to play 19 games (A.I.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kremin</b></h3>This was a bit of a slog, but I'm not wild about HotS so your mileage may vary. I leveled 19 characters up to level 2, using real people teammates vs AI, I found this got me more experience. I paid the $5 for the xp doubler in hopes it would go faster. Despite some other posters getting a full level in one match, for me almost all of them took 2 matches, and this with the xp boost. Each match took on average 15 minutes (some longer), and with it usually taking 2 matches to hit level 2, it's a significant time commitment. Anyway, ultimately it took about 8-9 hours spread out over 3 days of play. Still worth it I would say, already leveling up my Graves, nice little pet to have in the tool kit!</div>

Yes, it is still available. <br />I took the advise of several other posters, and leveled up multiple toons to levels 3 or 4. I actually enjoyed playing against the Ai (didn't have to deal with Aholes or people complaining about my lack of skill in the game. <br /><br />Was it worth it? Who knows - but I enjoyed the small grind, and it wasn't too bad. I just like the pets, so it wasn't a terrible grind.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ToviValdora</b></h3>I really didn't trust Blizzard to keep this pet around (based on the announcement) so I finally bit the bullet and knocked this out. Here's the strat I used to get it done asap.<br /><br />- Went against the AI at Beginner level. I'm not experienced with HoTS so it was best for me but if you get the hang of it pretty quick, feel free to bump up the difficulty. <br />- Level Valla to 10 to get the 7 days 100% boost. Valla is OP and I highly recommend using her first.<br />- Switched to any level 1 hero in my collection. 1 Hero level = 1 player level. As you level up it takes more and more exp to ding. If you have a bunch of heroes, just level them up to 2, or 3, depends on how many you have. If you only have a few heroes, try to spread it out. For example: level each one to 5 or 6.<br />- Concentrate of objectives. Let your AI team handle the enemy heroes. Objectives help the match go faster and it seems like which team does them is the one that wins.<br /><br />It's very important to either level a Hero to 10 to get the free 100% exp boost or just spend the $5 and buy it. To me this grind was horrid slog and I wanted it over pronto.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Arkamedix</b></h3>As usual, Blizzard hates their players. Beside the many anti-player in-game policies in WoW like FOMO (limited time achievements, events, pets, etc), now they force players to spend hours in a unlikeable game. <br />The best way to level up is to play with AI team vs AI team. If you play with real players, the duration is increased quite a lot (que time, games last way longer (even 25-30 min), etc). <br />For the AI gameplay you need: <br /><br />-You need 7 heroes at lvl 3 each hero level will give you one account level, the level required to unlock this pet, aka you need acc level 20. <br />- I don't know without exp boots because i bought it from start to reduce the time, but with exp boost you need to do 3 matches with each hero to level it to lvl 3, but without boosts i guess you multiply by 2 the requirement.<br />- Each game last between 12 to 15 min(sometimes 17-18 min), depending the map and how bad your allied AI is (yes the allied AI is very bad)<br />- Always play on easiest difficulty, for some reason on the highest difficulty the allied AI is very bad and the enemy AI is very good (it's almost like you would play vs real players). I tried a few games on highest difficulty and i lost all of them and they lasted longer (17 to 20 min). <br /><br />Now the math: let's assume you're lucky and each game last 12 min (but usually they are 14-15 min) you need to play 21 games multiplied by 12-15 min = a average of 270-300 min = 4-5 hours. Without boost this time is doubled and also the number of games needed to play. <br /><br />This is especially frustrating for players who never played moba style games and have no clue what they need to do. To force a player to play a game that he might not like for 10 hours it's ridiculous. But hey, this is Blizzard.</div>
