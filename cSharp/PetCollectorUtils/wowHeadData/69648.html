Well, that's a story.\n\nMy grandfather owned a large-ish chunk of land. When he bought it, it had some  little streams on it, and a pond. Then some beavers showed up, and started to build a dam in the streams. \nMy grandfather knew that if the beavers built that dam, a big part of his land would turn into swamp and wetlands. So, over the course of a few years, he would go down to the streams a few times a month, and pull the logs out of the dam, hoping the beavers would decide to go someplace else.\nBut the beavers wouldn't leave. People told my grandfather to poison or shoot the beavers - they were just animals, and they were going to destroy the value of his land. But he wouldn't kill them. He'd tried to make them leave, but he wouldn't kill them. \nMy grandfather neither wanted, nor really needed to kill the poor beavers who wouldn't leave. He didn't plan on selling the land anyway, he meant to leave it to his daughters, my mother and aunts, for them to build homes on. So he decided to leave the beavers alone.\nSo the beavers built their dam, and my aunts built their houses, and everyone, human and beaver, was happy.\nBy the time I was born, the northern portion of the land was a big swamp, and the rest was wetlands. The southern bit with the houses wasn't as bad, but the hay fields had sink holes had sink holes. \nBut it was OK; we all actually liked the land like that, all green and teeming with life. I have fond memories of playing in the woods with my cousins. Watching the turtles, frogs and beavers by the swamp. And the deer in the early morning, sneaking up next to the old house to eat the apples fallen from my grandmother's apple tree,\n\nIn letting those beavers live, despite the financial harm they caused him, my grandfather taught me to respect all living things. Everything that lives deserves to live, and in peace. (well, IRL, not in WoW xD)\n\nSo I named my virtual electric beaver pet Electric Jim, in honor of my grandfather(named Jim), and of the beavers who shaped the land on which I grew up. Kind of silly, I know, but I think it's nice all the same.","date":"2014-09-28T05:28:52-05:00","rating":77,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"That was actually quite a lovely tale.","creationdate":"2015-01-01T13:23:40-06:00","id":821690,"rating":10,"commentid":2006519,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"Kylini","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"An unexpected & pleasant story.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wiseguy149</b></h3>After an hour and a half of battling the other pets found around the swamp, I have yet to see one of these guys. Must be a lot more uncommon of a spawn on the island than the croaker and python.<br /><br />Update: Just found one after roughly 2 hours of searching. These guys are uncommon to find, but they're not that bad.<br />It is also worth noting that I have never seen one as a second spawn.<br /><br />Update 2: With stage 2 unlocked on my realm, I don't end up in another phase every time I leave the central Dire Moor area, and wild pets can be found in the surrounding area as well now. I've seen a couple more flappers since so they still definitely have an uncommon spawn rate, but they are much easier to find with more swamp for them to spawn in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jayrai</b></h3>Of the few new pets on Thunder Isle, this one seems to be the most difficult to find.<br />It's not as bad as some pets, such as the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62317">Minfernal</a>. It's just not a common spawn, unlike the other pets on the island.<br />The hunt isn't so bad, I've seen a good amount since my server unlocked Stage 2 last week.<br /><br /><u><b>Where?</b></u><br />I've seen most of these near the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=69292#objective-of">Sunreaver</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=69186">Kirin Tor perimeter wards</a>, but they <b>do</b> spawn all over the forest.<br />The Sunreaver Perimeter wards are just outside of the <u>Horde camp</u>: Dawnseeker Promontory.<br />The Kirin Toy Perimeter wards are just outside of the <u>Alliance camp</u>: Violet Rise.<br /><i>Click </i><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/zone=6507#.">here</a><i> for a map of the zone.</i><br /><br />They <b>do not</b> seem to spawn in Ihgaluk Crag or in Za'tual. <br />I <b>can not</b> confirm if they spawn in the Court of Bones or not. I have seen <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=69819">Swamp Croakers</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=69818">Elder Pythons</a> there, but none of these little guys.<br /><br /><u><b>How I found mine:</b></u><br />Take the road that goes all around Diremoor, circle around a few times. (Watch out for patrolling elites!)<br />While you're doing that, check in the Alliance/Horde areas once in a while (where the perimeter wards are set up).<br /><br /><b>***</b>They don't spawn as a secondary in battles.<b>***</b><br /><br /><b>These areas are in Stage 2 of the island.</b><br /><br /><u><b>Some quick tips about this pet:</b></u><br />While it looks like a beast, it's actually an <b>Elemental</b>.<br />Aquatic spells are very strong against Elemental, so maybe don't use Aquatic if you hope to capture it.<br />It's abilities are quite strong against Mechanical and Critter pets.<br /><br />This is quite a neat little pet for any pet collector.<br />Good luck, and happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>onelotus</b></h3>Well gosh, I hadn't seen one of these until tonight or maybe wasn't paying attention, but they are everywhere between Sunreaver peninsula and Court of bones, and I went a little bit the other way too. Perhaps its significant that I just finished the scenario of breaking through the wall and soloing the assistant to the thunder king whatever his name was, since people are suggesting they are phased. But easily tamed a blue rare, and battled several greens and whites. And I did see a couple as secondary pets to the main one. (or there is a rare chance they only come out at night?)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>squiretoad</b></h3>I'm in the &quot;To The Skies&quot; phase, stuck with Interception because I'm a hunter and can't melee well enough to kill 3 interceptors, but I digress.<br /><br />I went out and tried to tame one of these (and an Elder Python too). I could battle these pets, I could kill them .. but the capture box never came up as an option, not even with the pet's health down to 1%! Just uncapturable!<br /><br />Is this a glitch, or a feature? Must I do all those stupid solo scenarios and unlock the entire island before I can tame a lousy battle pet?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Avengerx</b></h3>Is it just me or does his moveset seem to be quite weak compared to the lightning croc and to most other pets?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gfkiim</b></h3>came across this and all I could think is why on earth is this not a hunter pet? :p</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SFFCorgi</b></h3>I'm wondering if all the island's pets spawn on some sort of timer. I was doing an upgrade hunt - finally found my Electrified Razortooth - but since a warlock had been doing rounds before me, by my third or fourth loop around the marsh, there were hardly any pets to battle <i>at all</i> except for the few I'd passed on, as they were/had Blue.<br /><br />Has anybody noticed any sort of timing yet?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kabotage</b></h3>I got this today while leveling my <a href="/spell=13548/westfall-chicken">Westfall Chicken</a>, lucky enough to encounter a rare type. Battled my <a href="/spell=69452/core-hound-pup">Core Hound Pup</a> to death just to capture this celebrity and quickly named him Justin Beaver. Its just frustrating that 2 levels were lost from capturing a pet higher than your current team. Anyways have fun pet hunting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cornellia</b></h3>A note to those ones: they are NOT up all the time - I was capturing IoT pets at like 18-19 (server time ofc) and they were as post above me stated at horde side perimeter wards. I logged in at like 3:20 and there were none. So my guess is they despawn at some time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rockegg</b></h3>This is such an attractive pet, and it has a couple of abilities that are interesting, so I wanted to like it. I really did. Used a stone on it and got it leveled to 23, and gave up on it. Too many lengthy cool downs on its moves mean you are very limited in how you use it. It would have to be the sort of pet you swap in and out for the sake of one or two moves. Tail Slap has no cool down but it only has an 80% hit chance and doesn't do a huge amount of damage. Maybe someone else can think of a use for this beautiful guy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TheOldBear</b></h3>I named mine Electric Jim. <br />Why, you ask? Well, that's a story.<br /><br />My grandfather owned a large-ish chunk of land. When he bought it, it had some little streams on it, and a pond. Then some beavers showed up, and started to build a dam in the streams. <br />My grandfather knew that if the beavers built that dam, a big part of his land would turn into swamp and wetlands. So, over the course of a few years, he would go down to the streams a few times a month, and pull the logs out of the dam, hoping the beavers would decide to go someplace else.<br />But the beavers wouldn't leave. People told my grandfather to poison or shoot the beavers - they were just animals, and they were going to destroy the value of his land. But he wouldn't kill them. He'd tried to make them leave, but he wouldn't kill them. <br />My grandfather neither wanted, nor really needed to kill the poor beavers who wouldn't leave. He didn't plan on selling the land anyway, he meant to leave it to his daughters, my mother and aunts, for them to build homes on. So he decided to leave the beavers alone.<br />So the beavers built their dam, and my aunts built their houses, and everyone, human and beaver, was happy.<br />By the time I was born, the northern portion of the land was a big swamp, and the rest was wetlands. The southern bit with the houses wasn't as bad, but the hay fields had sink holes had sink holes. <br />But it was OK; we all actually liked the land like that, all green and teeming with life. I have fond memories of playing in the woods with my cousins. Watching the turtles, frogs and beavers by the swamp. And the deer in the early morning, sneaking up next to the old house to eat the apples fallen from my grandmother's apple tree,<br /><br />In letting those beavers live, despite the financial harm they caused him, my grandfather taught me to respect all living things. Everything that lives deserves to live, and in peace. (well, IRL, not in WoW xD)<br /><br />So I named my virtual electric beaver pet Electric Jim, in honor of my grandfather(named Jim), and of the beavers who shaped the land on which I grew up. Kind of silly, I know, but I think it's nice all the same.</div>
