<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jjanchan</b></h3>This is one of the Order Hall pets that was introduced in Legion. The Order Hall pets are an interesting anomaly in terms of combat pets, in that they are class specific and are NOT cageable! <br /><b>This means that each of these pets is available to a particular class, and there is no way to obtain it short of rolling a toon of that class and completing the steps of the Order Hall progression required to obtain it.</b><br /><br />Blizzard has further stated that this is their intention on Twitter:<br /><ul><li><b><i>Are the battle pets obtained from the Order Halls intended to be non-tradable?</i></b><br />Yes, hardcore battle pet collectors will need to alt it up to complete their collections. - Muffinus (<a href="https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/737750767851831296" rel="nofollow">Source</a>)<br /></li><li><b><i>But this requires a lvl 98 alt for every class and the artifact system isn't Alt friendly?</i></b><br />Not every class has a pet associated, nor do they generally require full OH progression. - Muffinus (<a href="https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/738045787473477632" rel="nofollow">Source</a>)<br /></li></ul><br /><br />Thus far the pets that are available via Order Halls are listed below - this should be a complete list (<a href="https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/738050325848825857" rel="nofollow">Source</a>).<br /><table><br /><tr><br /><td><b>Class</b><br /></td><br /><td><b>Order Hall</b><br /></td><br /><td><b>Item<br />(Battle Pet)</b><br /></td><br /><td><b>Family</b><br /></td><br /><td><b>Comments</b><br /></td><br /></tr><br /><td><a href="/item=141599/fel-barbed-spear">Fel Barbed Spear</a><br /></td><br /><tr><br /><td><a href="/class=11/druid">Druid</a><br /></td><br /><td><a href="/zone=7846/the-dreamgrove">The Dreamgrove</a><br /></td><br /><td><a href="/item=129362/broot">Broot</a><br />(<a href="/npc=98463/broot">Broot</a>)<br /></td><br /><td>Elemental<br /></td><br /><td><b>Flavour Text:</b> <i>I am Broot.</i><br /><b>Acquisition:</b> Requires the Tier 2 Order Hall Advancement upgrade ability <a href="/order-advancement=354/evergreen">Evergreen</a>.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>grootiez</b></h3>I still think Broot should have an ability called We are Broot. <br /><br /><b>We are Broot</b>- Broot encases his allies in a thorn cocoon to shield them from certain death. However, Broot will die and remain dead for one round until he resprouts as a dancing sapling.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kimiya</b></h3>The way to obtain Broot through the Dreamgrove (Druid order hall) is to select the <a href="/order-advancement=354/evergreen">Evergreen</a> order advancement (second tier of advancement). While most of the plants that grow provide food or buff items, there is a chance to grow <a href="/item=129362/broot">Broot</a>! <br /><br />You can only possess one in your pet collection, and he cannot be caged.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jbrinley</b></h3>Anyone know if you can summon these outside of the class once obtained? For instance...could my priest summon the druid pet?<br /><br />*edit: The answer is yes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cntrygirldb</b></h3>Sure wish you could vendor Broot. I get at least one a month if not more. You can only have one and you cant sell them. Seems like a waste</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>grootiez</b></h3>Too bad that heâ€™s dust now...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mikeysce</b></h3>As an FYI, it's totally possible to get Broot using a Trial character in BFA. BFA toons last for three hours so as long as you're quick you can get your gardens running with plenty of time to spare.<br /><br /><ol><li>Create yourself a lvl 110 Druid. </li><li>Once you log in, immediately Hearth out to Stormwind/Org</li><li>Use the portal in your capital city to port to Dalaran (ask a town guard if you don't know where).</li><li>An NPC with the legendary quest line will meet you in Dala right as you warp in.</li><li>Follow that questline unlocking your Order Hall and first artifact (I went with the Balance one) until you can research the first Order Hall improvement. </li><li>Once that's started log out. </li><li>When your first improvement is done, log back in and start Evergreen. Now log out again.</li><li>Come back after four hours and plant your gardens!</li><li>Unless you've been messing around, this will probably have only taken you about 90 minutes of time /played. Now you have 90 more minutes to work with logging in once every three days for just a minute or two and check and replant your gardens. </li></ol><br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />(Step 10: Blizzard changes the rules with Trial character without any notice again and screws this whole thing over. LOL)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rosey1326</b></h3>I had no idea this guy existed til about 10 minutes ago while I was looking at the guide for Gnomeragan challenge. Jumped on my druid, saw that I had the garden research and clicked the plants. First thing I got was Broot. Pretty lucky rng for once.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rigbiez</b></h3>I boosted my druid in BFA and am trying to figure out what I need to do to be able to unlock Broot. I have done the quests up to unlocking the artefact weapon and can now access the dreamgrove. When I talk to the Dreamgrove researcher it is no longer available to research order hall buffs. Any help appreciated.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Draemerr</b></h3>I have just taken an abandoned level 45 Druid through the steps to access order hall, and requested the 4-hour &quot;Evergreen&quot; upgrade. I'll try to update my efforts to obtain Broot every 3 days to give one persons RNG drop rate. Fingers crossed a single update will be sufficient! Edit: so far 3 rounds of planting/harvesting and no luck so far 2 weeks after initial planting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>whaley</b></h3>Im starting now - so I'll be back in 3 days. I must be mad but want Broot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>glowcloud9</b></h3>Just started going for this little dude and wanted to clarify something I had issues with: I don't know if it's a bug or &quot;working as intended,&quot; but I was halfway through my third weapon questline (Resto) and had never unlocked the research options...so was unable to at all. I couldn't even view them, I just got a flavor text that implied that research was no longer a thing. <br /><br />Even though I already did the mission table stuff, had two weapons unlocked, all of that. I had to finish up that weapon questline before I could unlock the research options, but as soon as it was over, the research options appeared as they should have. Now I'm just waiting on my plants.</div>
