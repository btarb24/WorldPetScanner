When wild pets are caught or killed in the zone, it frees up a spot for a new spawn to appear somewhere on the map. Because there are more 'normal' pet nodes in a zone, it is more likely that a 'normal' battle pet will spawn, with a smaller chance to spawn at the 'rarer' spawns. But it seems with enough catches\/kills, the rarer battle pets will eventually appear.\r\n\r\nBut the major problem here is that a phasing issue can occur at the huge spawn point between Bloodgulch and Firebeard's Patrol, locking out 12 of the potential 20 spawn points. (I'm using an addon called PetTracker that shows battle pet spawn points on the map.)\r\n\r\nSo although clearing battle pets on the map has worked extremely well for catching other rarer spawns quickly--Tiny Twister, Scorpling, Minfernal, etc--it is still extremely difficult for this one as Twilight Highlands as there are over 250 other battle pet spawn points that a pet may appear at and a lot of area to cover to clear pets.\r\n\r\nMy experience has been that only catching\/killing battle pet critters affects respawning--killing non-battle critters seems to have no effect. This can save running\/mount time only focusing on clearing battle pets.\r\n\r\nThough the big spawn area is phased once you step into it, you can see\/target\/interact\/range attack battle pets at the border. You can sometimes rush in and interact with a pet before they disappear.

Most of them are spawning close to hostile mobs of level 85, so finding one in a safe spot might be difficult, if not impossible; prepare to do a lot of clearing before you attack them! When clicked, they make the characteristic fleshbeast growls and gibbering noises.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>265695</b></h3>They appear to have a phasing issue at the moment. On a character with all the quests completed, I can see them at a distance, but all the battle pets phase out as I get closer. Hope this gets resolved soon. <br /><br />Will have to try on a toon that hasn't done any Twilight Highlands quests.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gilroykilroy</b></h3>Kill all critters in the area. Wait for respawn. May have to do this a few times but usually one will pop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1045117</b></h3>I spent a couple of hours yesterday killing critters trying to get this thing to spawn. Finally I got on this morning, killed a few more, and four of these popped up. It was about 5:30 AM server time...might these have something to do with time of day? Also, they have a tendency to pop on ground that is too uneven to battle, so be prepared to be frustrated.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>859040</b></h3>I think i see why people are finding this hard to find. This will disapear (from my experience) the second that you are not im Twilight Highlands. This is to be understood as in, when you are in Twilight Highlands but at fx. Firebeard Cemetary in the Twilight Highlands. you must simply be in Twilight Highlands and not any other place. when you are, simply target the Twilight Fiendling when it is close to being out of the &quot;corrupted area&quot; and fly in. You have to be fairly quick though, but easily done! I just battled 4 of these at cord: 56,58. sadly the best i got was Uncommon, but i only wanted the pet, so I'm happy. But if you're having problems finding it, simply make sure that you are NOT in anything called other than Twilight Highlands. hope this helps abit.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Omgomgesiuol</b></h3>This pet + Shadow Priests + Glyph of Shadowy Friends = The only pet you should ever have out at a party.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tanfana</b></h3>Having done every quest in this zone long ago I was afraid phasing would be an issue. In two of the areas where this guy spawns it was. However, the northern-most area (The Black Breach) had Twilight Fiendlings with no phasing issues. Happy hunting folks!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>223389</b></h3>Do not waste your time completing all the quests in the Twilight Highlands. &quot;The Devouring Breach&quot; will not phase back. A GM told me to use QuestHub and WowHead to finish the quests.<br /><br />Three wasted evenings and 6 hours later there was no change.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>decembre</b></h3>These, along with many of the other rarer battle pet spawns, seem to work much like fishing nodes--where only a set amount of battle pets can be on the map at one time. When wild pets are caught or killed in the zone, it frees up a spot for a new spawn to appear somewhere on the map. Because there are more 'normal' pet nodes in a zone, it is more likely that a 'normal' battle pet will spawn, with a smaller chance to spawn at the 'rarer' spawns. But it seems with enough catches/kills, the rarer battle pets will eventually appear.<br /><br />But the major problem here is that a phasing issue can occur at the huge spawn point between Bloodgulch and Firebeard's Patrol, locking out 12 of the potential 20 spawn points. (I'm using an addon called PetTracker that shows battle pet spawn points on the map.)<br /><br />So although clearing battle pets on the map has worked extremely well for catching other rarer spawns quickly--Tiny Twister, Scorpling, Minfernal, etc--it is still extremely difficult for this one as Twilight Highlands as there are over 250 other battle pet spawn points that a pet may appear at and a lot of area to cover to clear pets.<br /><br />My experience has been that only catching/killing battle pet critters affects respawning--killing non-battle critters seems to have no effect. This can save running/mount time only focusing on clearing battle pets.<br /><br />Though the big spawn area is phased once you step into it, you can see/target/interact/range attack battle pets at the border. You can sometimes rush in and interact with a pet before they disappear. It helps to use the 'Interact with Target' key bind if you do this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AutumnLily</b></h3>I got mine as a primary at Black Breach. However someone else that was looking for one got one at Twilight Breach as a secondary. The primary was a Twilight spider.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>illiterate</b></h3>Fastest way to get this is to get on an alt that hasn't quested in TH and look for them in the Devouring Breach. They don't appear as secondary pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Twalker</b></h3>l had completed all the quests in the area back in Cata. l found mine at The Twilight Breach. Didn't seem to have any issues with phasing. Blizz may have fixed it. Had to spend about 45 mins circling the three area before l found one so has a low spawn rate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>saurron</b></h3>Just picked mine up today, uncommon quality, but very pleased.<br /><br />One thing to note - in my case it took me about 6 min. to actually engage because I was getting the <b>&quot;battle area obscured&quot;</b> message since my fiendling was up on a ledge. But after clicking like a mad man about a 100 times, he finally (to my amazement) walked down off the ledge onto a more open area. So be patient if you encounter this situation and good luck to all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>223389</b></h3>They have fixed the phasing issue. Only this pet will spawn in the area though. It makes finding your rare easier now as they won't share spawns with the others. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>candicane</b></h3>As of December 24... there is definitely a phasing issue with this. On my main I cannot see even any non-capturable critters. After switching to an alt, the area is loaded with spiders and cockroaches to battle.<br /><br />*ETA fiendling spawned not too long after I started killing non-battle pets and battling the others</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>776458</b></h3>Been bouncing between the three areas for about two hours now. Only found one or two Uncommon, the rest were of lower quality. They aren't really &quot;rare&quot;, so to speak. There are definitely more cockroaches and spiders around but the fiendlings ARE around. <br />They don't seem to join any other critter battles. I've got rares of every TwiHiLands critters (except skunk and gryphon) while battling every kind of critter and I've never seen them join any critter battles. Not even another fiendling battle. So if you have all the rest of the critters, don't waste time battling them and just kill them to free up spots for the fiendlings.<br />(The gryphons, however DO join other critter battles and since they aren't easy to find either, it's worth noting that you may want to take the extra few seconds to pop into the critter battle to see who comes in instead of just killing them right away).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Elizahbeth</b></h3>A guildmate got his fiendling last night, (01/10/13) and it was he who told me about the phasing issues that others were experiencing. Today, I went into Twilight Highlands meaning to just capture the other zone pets, and was able to see, approach and capture the fiendling with no issue. The only difference between he and I, is that I have Cata Loremaster, and he's only gone half way into the zone before moving on. I'm thinking that perhaps this solves the phasing issue. Unless, that is of course it's been fixed since last night.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Entilzha2161</b></h3>According to <a href="http://petsear.ch" rel="nofollow">http://petsear.ch</a> there's a breed of this pet that does 341 damage rare at level 25. I got a poor of the correct breed (you can tell which breed you have or are facing by toggling the level/quality). I decided it was worth a stone; 5 breeds means fishing for a rare still means only a 1/5 chance it's the best breed and with the next closest breed at 293, it's a huge difference and you're not getting the most out of this unique pet unless you have the high-damage breed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DracoEX</b></h3>These Fiends Appeared in Diablo 2 when you chased after the Dark Wanderer on the Second Act</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SoCalWoWGal</b></h3>From <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/11235396" rel="nofollow">Major Payneâ€™s Pet Menagerie: Twilight Fiendling</a>:<br /><br /><div class="quote-box">My mind swirls with determination, so much so that it almost feels like Iâ€™m corrupted. I seethe with focused anger at the thought of anyone or anything not tasting the edge of my blade. If ever there lives a creature that has not squared off against me in heated battle, I should question my own existence! Yet there is one key difference between me and the mindless drones that drool with genetics-led passion for bloodlust: Iâ€™m guided by divine wisdom, tested strength, and a set of biceps that could pop the head off an Iron Giant like a Telaari Grape, and they are not! Watch me flex and kiss each one!<br /><br />Horrors are not uncommon in this world. From the watery expanse of the Abyssal Depths to the darkened halls of Karazhan, manifestations of corrupted dreams creep in the darkness searching for hosts to sate their parasitic tendencies. But many donâ€™t know of the nests of fiends that skitter to and fro across the stained earth in Twilight Highlands. Twilight Fiendlingsâ€”to be more specificâ€”are vicious freeloaders that aimlessly seek small prey from which they can draw life with their toothy little mouths. Prey like your face!<br /><br />Pugtastic has some more information about these devilish beings. </div><br /><br /><div class="quote-box"><i>Crithto: The creeping embodiments of nightmares, Twilight Fiendlings can be found in corrupted areas of Twilight Highlandsâ€”though you may need to quest a bit in the region to remove the veil that hides these pets from newcomers. (In other words, they may be affected by phasing.) Once captured and properly trained, these magical creatures can become an actual nightmare for your opponent. Combine Adrenal Glands and Leap to see your enemyâ€™s health diminish to life-threatening levels, or fire off Rake and Siphon Life to secure your petâ€™s dominance. Just a couple warnings for those who wish to tame one: they donâ€™t like to be pet, and I firmly suggest you do not tug at their tentacles, as this will only result in loss of limb</i>.</div><br /><br /><div class="quote-box">There can only be one menace on this planet . . . and thatâ€™s me! Therefore, your orders are to head to Twilight Highlands and capture not one, but three of these specimens for me to exterminâ€”err, I mean examine for, uhh, research purposes. Yeah, thatâ€™s it! And I donâ€™t want ones that are weak or malnourishedâ€”I want you to bring back only the finest in quality! Do this for me, and I might just stop referring to you as maggots and upgrade you to urchins! LOOKING AT YOU GIVES ME SCARY DREAMS. GET OUTTA MY SIGHT!<br /></div><br /><br />BRUSHES TEETH WITH GNOMES</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tylana</b></h3>I think the bug may have been fixed. I have done all the quests in the Twilight Highlands and have been able to capture 2 Twilight Fiendlings.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>andrearochel</b></h3>I captured mine as a primary pet at the Black Breach in Twilight Highlands. I got lucky and got a rare the first time around. I did not have any phasing issues, but I had not done any quests here either. There were about 6 as primary pets where I was at. <br /><br />My cords were 58.54/30.14<br /><br />Happy hunting. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1367794</b></h3>The respawn timer is roughly 5-6 hours, just zoned into twilight highlands (as I'm just starting to collect battle pets) and did it on my alliance warrior who never entered twilight highlands before. I hit the 3 main areas with the fiendlings first, clearing out common and poor pets, captured 2 rares on my first run. Then I went through all of highlands capturing rares of everything else that highlands has to offer occasionally checking the spawn points of the fiendlings. After ~6 hours I saw one of them had all of them back, but no rares, moved on to the next, again no rares... so I'm thinking this is like most areas with a set determined of spawns and there is actually a spawn rate, and not having to kill anything all around the area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>huldu</b></h3>This is actually quite a powerful pet and not used very often, possibly overlooked like many other great pets out there.</div>
