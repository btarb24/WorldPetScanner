The fact that someone was always battling one told me that the issue is not spawn times; the issue is that it is being heavily camped by many players (CRZ doesn't help), and the whelps are being taken down by someone as soon as a whelp spawn.\n\n[b]I decided to test this theory.[\/b]\n\nI left a character stationed there, logged in every 20 to 30 minutes, did a circle around the area, and almost every time I logged in there was a whelp, some were rare. I logged in on day two of my hunt at about 3AM server time and there where eight of themâ€”one was a rare, but not the P\/P breed I was after. I wiped out all of them except for the rares. (I called out locally for other pet hunters to get them so I could weed out the competition). The spawn of about one to three every thirty or fourty minutes was constant. I got my breed P\/P in two and a half days of camping, logging in and out.\n\nI went through a hundred Whelps in a little under three days in order to get the rare I wanted. So no, they are not that rare; they are just heavily hunted.\n\n[b]My tip is this: [\/b]There is hardly ever any competition in the very early morning. I got mine about 6AM server time (but not because they spawn at 6AM, time had nothing to do with it). No one else was in the area that early, and no one ever is (except us crazy pet breed hunters), and not even someone to take the rare I didn't need that morning.\n\n([b]Note:[\/b] [i]Killing dragons, eggs, and other things didn't help. I killed several eggs, whelps, and whatnot, and one solitary whelp spawned. Killing things was just giving me something to do as the time passed. When ALL the other ones spawned there was no one at all killing in the area. I didn't get mine from killing eggs and whelps; they just spawned like most other battle-pets do. If you have skinning, then killing dragons is useful.

I hung around for 5 or 10 minutes and left.\n\nJust now I decided to swing through before going to the darkmoon faire. No other players were in the area (it was around 4:45 AM here) and there was an emerald proto whelp just sitting there for the taking and it was in the southern part of the savage thicket near no enemies, just a few critters, while the first I got spawned in the north.\n\nI'm beginning to doubt if the killing of enemies has anything to do with the spawning, but I'm just happy I now have 2 of these awesome pets. Will definitely be coming back for a third. Based on my experience, camping them is probably a waste of time. Try a few short trips here and there. In any case, it's much better than trying to farm whelps in feralas for that retardedly low drop rate, and these emerald proto whelps are worth it.\n\nOne more note about how powerful they are, I can level 2 other pets in draenor with the emerald proto whelp in the third battle pet slot fighting level 25 enemiesâ€”this is very easy in shadowmoon valley where you get level 23-25 and lots of moths. The whelp will sometimes 1-shot the moths! I just always have it use Emerald Presence shield, and maybe heal 1-3 times during the battle. If you use one of those training biscuits you can quickly level 2 petsâ€”and don't worry about the rarity. You can easily buy an upgrade stone from your garrison menagerie to make it rare for a measly 15 charms, and I was lucky enough to win a dragonkin upgrade stone while doing the daily battles.\n\nAnyway, just my thoughts. Badass battle pet worth the time to get.\n\nEDIT: After I wrote this another one had spawned on the middle east side, which I battled and captured. Then I went up to the north part and another one was there. Not sure what the spawn times are related to now, they may be random timers, or timers that change based on time of day and number of players. There was one other player there and neither of us had killed anything, so [b]these spawns had nothing to do with killing the mobs[\/b].","date":"2015-04-07T04:00:48-05:00","rating":4,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2015-04-07T05:49:55-05:00",1,"Xeroe"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":70,"id":2190572,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Aquaria","body":"After making a few loops around the thicket, I went on to check spawn points for the Val'kyr, with no luck, came back to do a few more circles and there one was!

In particular, the Tiny Terrors can all be bested by two pets specific to the lead enemy and the Proto-Whelp as a third pet to deal with whatever they had in the back line.  What's more, the Emerald Proto-Whelp does not appear to be particularly difficult to locate at this time.  This means you can have your choice of breed: I prefer P\/P but any breed will do.\r\n\r\nThe key to a happy Proto-Whelp lies in the combination of Emerald Presence and Emerald Dream. Emerald Presence, having 100% uptime, is what makes the Proto-Whelp good at sustaining itself against attrition damage: Average attacks will be blunted while multiple weaker strikes such as Swarm may be negated entirely.  Emerald Dream, on the other hand, will erase what damage does get through presence -- very few foes, at least in the wild, are capable of doing enough damage over Emerald Presence to keep you from topping off entirely with Emerald Dream.  Whether you take Breath or Emerald Bite is a matter of taste, but I generally favor Emerald Bite as Flying pets are far more common than Magical in the wild and Undead and Mechanical are similarly rare.\r\n\r\nWhile the bane of the Tiny Terrors and significantly hostile to the elite Pandaria pets, the Proto-Whelp's utility falls off in PvP where forced-swap, stuns, humanoids, and high-damage combos are the order of the day.  However, since the side dish of the day is the multi-hit-extra-damage team, which Emerald Presence nerfs almost entirely out of existence, the Proto-Whelp can still find some purchase on PvP teams that aren't setting up for any particular combo (or are doing it in two pets) as a counter play.  The Anubisath Idol may be more tanky while its out, but the Proto-Whelp can actually come back from taking burst damage on its own while the Anubisath will need some help if anything meaningful gets through the sandstorm wall.  Taking both, possibly with another extremely durable pet like the Ruby Droplet or Magical Crawdad, is a way to have a good win-rate in PvP Pet battles, though I hesitate to say it's a good way owing that the battles will take an awfully long time as all mentioned pets are, naturally, lacking in the offense department.","date":"2016-05-24T09:51:18-05:00","rating":13,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":84,"id":2346047,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"ChristinePi","body":"I can confirm that killing the primordial drakes makes it spawn.

One today 11/28/12 at 10:00 am EST Logged in so fast (first few tries the Northrend World Server was still down) and there was no spawns at all. Flew around for a good 15 minutes to see if any would spawn and none did.<br /><br />I do not think they are set up like the Scourged Whelplings at all.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />News from a Blue on the Pet Battles forum:<br /><br /><div class="quote-box">Posted by Bashiok<br />The new pets are on fairly long spawn timers, and are randomized (i.e. will not spawn on server restart). We've confirmed they have been spawning on some realms, so just keep an eye out!<br /><br />They're random, so they're not going to spawn on every realm at the same time. So yeah, working as intended.</div></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1041641</b></h3>Most likely one of the stronger dragonling pets you can have. His Emerald Dream spell combined with Emerald presence makes this wonderful little proto to one of the toughest pets to break. He can take an enormous amount of damage and still heal almost full health with the dream.<br /><br />If you like tanky pets who can self sustain then this one is a easy pick. The spawn is abit slow but if you manage to catch one that isn't rare then a upgrade gem that you can loot is well spent on him!<br /><br />After the accuracy change on abilities he became even stronger, making his two basic damage attacks very powerful. If you use a P/P build of this one he'll have 341 Power and 1400 HP. His Breath/Emerald bite will do 400 damage. Making him both good tank and very good dps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>applebear</b></h3>So far, can't see anything real special to make these spawn...watched people run around killing the big dragons and this doesn't seem to have an effect. Waited around an hour when I finally seen one but someone else was near it. Sent him a whisper asking if he was going to take it and he was, so I left him to it. He then whispered back asking if I cared about the quality. I didn't, so he logged out for me and let me have it . <br /><br />Please consider others when the pet has a low spawn rate and log out after you engage and find out the pet isn't a rare, so the pet doesn't despawn and someone else can have it. <br /><br />The quality I got was poor, and I left after that. I personally can not stand the headache that goes with these rare spawns. I will make it rare later if it means that much to me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>owlloveyou</b></h3>OK! This I had to alt-f4 out twice because i kept killing it even though it was only level 22. It was common and it's perfect :) I caught this baby at 4:19 am with noone around, near the bottom of the Thicket. Good luck, it goes perfectly with the Green Proto-Drake mount!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kittytreets</b></h3>So, I don't know if this actually had anything to do with the whelps spawning for me or not, but I felt like it did. So, I spent about an hour looking around for these guys on two different days. Not much, sure, but you would think at least ONE would spawn within that time (even if I saw someone else grab it). <br /><br />I was bored waiting around so I started killing all the big drakes and the eggs and then the whelps (neutral) that come out of those eggs. An emerald whelp spawned shortly after I downed about 5 or so of the eggs and their neutral whelps. I was unmounted so some other guy got it. I was torn up! But whatever. I continued to take out revenge on the surrounding creatures as I had been...another one spawned. I got him! Sure, he was POOR but still. I'm sort of just happy to have one considering how many people were/still are camping that tiny spawn point (and shared realms make it tough). <br /><br />I am sure this tactic will be proven wrong but I thought it was interesting how the two spawned with in minutes of each other after I started murdering drakes, eggs and their neutral whelps out of boredom. Before I'd started doing that myself AND the other campers had not seen one spawn at all. Something to try at least if you're bored! ;o) You get a few mats you can sell on the AH from the drakes too (and great if you're a skinner).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Apolloshot</b></h3>Been out here for 8 hours straight, not a single spawn (not even one I've lost to someone else).<br /><br />Tried killing mobs, did nothing, even set up NPCscan for times I had to use the restroom...<br /><br />Getting pretty tired of the grindfest this game has become, it puts TBC to shame at this point.</div>

I went off to start the dishes came back and saw him there right beneath me :) swooped down engaged him and he was a rare! Already loving him!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>775137</b></h3>I don't normally believe in the &quot;kill all the stuff around&quot; business, but since I've not seen any in the last several days I've hunted, I figured what the heck. I started killing eggs and neutral whelps, and lo and behold, two emerald proto-drakes spawned. The one I got was a poor, and someone else got the other. So... I was going to be content with it, but thought why not try once more.... and guess what? Another spawned, this time an uncommon. Got him and happy. Just thought I'd share.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>264322</b></h3>Definitely this was the hardest and longest capture fight I have had. The whelp's healing abilities are so strong it was difficult to keep him under 35% health. Wish I had taken my <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62555">Flayer Youngling</a> along, his kick would have been useful against the whelp's Emerald Dream.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>igooana</b></h3>I can confirm that killing dragons and their eggs will usually result in a couple of these little guys spawning. Normally when I get there there are 1-2 people just hanging out waiting for their NPC scan to alarm so I go to work and within 15 minutes there are 2 of them flying around. If it's not rare I'll announce to the zone and /camp out. <br />Unfortunately, whenever I run around killing stuff there are a couple scrubs just watching me ready to jump on the next whelp that pops up so I have no idea if a rare has spawned that I missed out on.<br />edit: I think the eggs and hatchlings are linked to the whelp spawns because I noticed that when 2 spawned the eggs that were normally there weren't. Killing the adults can't hurt, though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Midaria</b></h3>I can also confirm that killing the mobs around where the Emerald Proto-Whelps spawn helps. Sat around for about half an hour with no spawns, started killing things and within a minute one popped up. Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>indyfan1202</b></h3>These guys seem to respawn every ten minutes or so, regardless of whether you kill other things in The Savage Thicket or not. I spent 90 minutes killing <a href="/npc=28408/primordial-drake-egg">Primordial Drake Egg</a>, <a href="/npc=28389/primordial-hatchling">Primordial Hatchling</a>, and <a href="/npc=28378/primordial-drake">Primordial Drake</a> in the area and 5 total <a href="/npc=68850/emerald-proto-whelp">Emerald Proto-Whelp</a>s (1 Rare, 1 Uncommon, 2 Common, and 1 Poor) spawned, with the Rare spawning 90 minutes after I first entered The Savage Thicket and began slaughtering mobs. I then waited 40 minutes without killing any mobs in the area and found that 2 Uncommon and 1 Common <a href="/npc=68850/emerald-proto-whelp">Emerald Proto-Whelp</a> had spawned.<br /><br />However, to pass the time between spawns, you may want to slaughter <a href="/npc=28378/primordial-drake">Primordial Drake</a> for their <a href="/item=43013/chilled-meat">Chilled Meat</a>, and Skinners can get <a href="/item=33568/borean-leather">Borean Leather</a> and <a href="/item=38557/icy-dragonscale">Icy Dragonscale</a> from them as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gelf</b></h3>Emerald Proto-drake is an excellent pet for many of the MoP tamer dailies. While he shares some abilities with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=7545">Emerald Whelpling</a> it is much easier to find (or upgrade to using a battle-stone) a rare Emerald Proto-drake.<br /><br />As a Dragonkin he takes reduced damage from Flying type attacks, and with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=525">Emerald Bite </a>(a Magic type attack) he deals extra damage against Flying type battle pets, which makes him perfect against most Flying battle-pets.<br /><br />Also the combination of damage reduction (<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=597"> Emerald Presence</a>) and powerful healing (<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=598">Emerald Dream</a>) means he is capable of soloing most other battle pet types (pretty much any that cannot heal themselves).</div>

I watched a 75 hunter killing a lot of stuff and I waited a while, nothing, I qued for a pet battle and when I came out one was literately under my feet and it was a blue. What a honey this pet is . Hope all of you that want one gets one. thanks for all your tips that made me hang out and wait ...was so worth it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>503532</b></h3><b>The spawn time is not long like some have said here.<br /><br />Here are my observations:</b><br /><br />When hunting this pet I ALWAYS saw someone capturing it every time I flew through. The fact that someone was always battling one told me that the issue is not spawn times; the issue is that it is being heavily camped by many players (CRZ doesn't help), and the whelps are being taken down by someone as soon as a whelp spawn.<br /><br /><b>I decided to test this theory.</b><br /><br />I left a character stationed there, logged in every 20 to 30 minutes, did a circle around the area, and almost every time I logged in there was a whelp, some were rare. I logged in on day two of my hunt at about 3AM server time and there where eight of themâ€”one was a rare, but not the P/P breed I was after. I wiped out all of them except for the rares. (I called out locally for other pet hunters to get them so I could weed out the competition). The spawn of about one to three every thirty or fourty minutes was constant. I got my breed P/P in two and a half days of camping, logging in and out.<br /><br />I went through a hundred Whelps in a little under three days in order to get the rare I wanted. So no, they are not that rare; they are just heavily hunted.<br /><br /><b>My tip is this: </b>There is hardly ever any competition in the very early morning. I got mine about 6AM server time (but not because they spawn at 6AM, time had nothing to do with it). No one else was in the area that early, and no one ever is (except us crazy pet breed hunters), and not even someone to take the rare I didn't need that morning.<br /><br />(<b>Note:</b> <i>Killing dragons, eggs, and other things didn't help. I killed several eggs, whelps, and whatnot, and one solitary whelp spawned. Killing things was just giving me something to do as the time passed. When ALL the other ones spawned there was no one at all killing in the area. I didn't get mine from killing eggs and whelps; they just spawned like most other battle-pets do. If you have skinning, then killing dragons is useful. Otherwise, just log in every 30 minutes and you'll get your Emerald Proto Whelp.</i>)<br /><br />I hope this is helpful. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Oblique</b></h3>I've been camping this for about 2 hours, clearing everything in the thicket, and a little east of it. No spawns. There's no competition either. Like most things in this game, the spawn rate seems to be tied to the amount of players in the area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>912204</b></h3>After killing every other battle pet in the zone for an hour or so, I finally got incredibly lucky and ended up with an uncommon P/P whelp, which upgraded with a stone to an absolute powerhouse that solos everything it encounters.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>duh1989</b></h3>Do you get angry when the enemy comes up with 3 flying and you cant even hit them? So, get your Emerald Whelpling and your troubles are gone. He is Weak (takes less damage) against Flying pets and have a Magic Strike which is strong (higher damage) against Falying pets. And also reduces like 90 dmg EACH attack with Emerald Presence, so those triple hits are going to do like 60 dmg each... and you can ALSO recover 1125 in like 3 rounds... almost impossible for a Flying pet to kill you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>931975</b></h3>I was patiently waiting for the Emerald Proto-Whelp to appear when I saw two low-level horde in the area on &quot;Stampy&quot; the mammoth. The first was a Blood Elf, the second was a Tauren (I'm a Draenei Priest). I flew over to check them out and emoted them as I waited as I had waited for the whelp to appear, and I saw they were out to kill the large dragon for the quest in the area. I waited until their mammoth tagged it before I took it out with one shot. The Tauren stood there, targeted me, and thanked me. I did a quick /wave /yw and /smile back.<br /><br />I mounted up, flew back into the middle of the savage thicket, and there was a single Emerald Proto-Whelp undisturbed. When I had started waiting, there were two other 90's surveying the area. It turned out to be an uncommon!<br /><br />Thank you, karma!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Deien</b></h3>I have been checking The Savage Thicket for months in hopes of getting an additional whelp to add to my pets; I like to have at least 2 of each for the Celestial Tournament teams since you cannot heal. I have not seen any level Emerald Proto-Whelp spawn in quite some time and decided to come read the comments here for any ideas. When I read AvernaKM's comment about killing eggs and the neutral Primordial Hatchlings I decided I would give it a try. <br /><br />30 minutes later I found a Proto-Whelp BUT in such a manner that I felt I should come post this news for others. <br /><br />I was killing eggs and saw a whelp that did not have the usual name plate above its head. I passed my cursor over the whelp and it turned into the green paw! I targeted it and it said it was an Emerald Proto-Whelp! Good Grief! I went to the whelp and right-clicked - yeppers, a battle pet with no name plate and no green paw on it OR on my mini-map!<br /><br />Now I am thinking about all the times I have flown over The Savage Thicket, never seeing a single green paw on my mini-map or on the ground, and I am wondering if there had always been at least one whelp down there; unmarked, being totally ignored. Guess if I want more than one I will have to walk The Savage Thicket instead of investigating from above.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PhaseSix</b></h3>Figured I'd chime in because it seemed like this pet was bugged for me as it hadn't spawned for days.<br /><br />For several days straight I would sit at this camp for around 2-3 hours with NOT A SINGLE spawn of the Proto-Whelp. I tried clearing everything like some posts suggested and doing nothing as some posts suggested. Nothing worked, it just would not spawn.<br /><br />I am on a high population server but there was never another person in the area, not even people leveling. It was all to myself every time and the pet just never spawned no matter what I did... for hours.<br /><br />I decided today to take a nap since I work nights, logged back in about 8 hours later, and the area was absolutely littered with Proto-Whelps. Green Paws were EVERYWHERE on my minimap. They even seemed to be spawn behind me as I plowed through them trying to find a P/P or a rare. And guess what, my patience paid off. The 10th or so whelp that I fought was a Rare P/P - I couldn't believe it. I caught it and left the other 10 or so that were still up for the next guy, hopefully he's not as unlucky/lucky as me!<br /><br />Everyone here had one motto that they kept sticking with - Patience. It really does take patience. If they aren't up, try again later. I figured I'd only see one when it finally spawned, there had to be 20. I took the liberty of taking a screenshot -AFTER- catching my rare (that's after killing about 10) of there being 5 on my minimap still. <br /><br /><a href="http://images.bluegartr.com/bucket/gallery/bfd920d288395d534d7619dbe5f76e00.png" rel="nofollow">Emerald Proto-Whelp Minimap</a><br /><br />Just be patient, 7/15/14 was when I got mine.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xeroe</b></h3>This is by far the best pet I have and works well against many different opponents because of it's strong emerald bite attack and ability to heal so well. Only some of the epic and legendary pets of master trainers were able to kill it before I could heal it fully, but that was only twice out of a lot of battles.<br /><br />I just wanted to add my experience now that I've gotten two of them in the past few days.<br /><br />The first time, I went to savage thicket, killed everything I could and no dice. So I flew east, did one pet battle, came back, killed a few more proto drakes (large ones and whelps from eggs) and then the battle pet spawned right near me. Total time was about 10-15 minutes.<br /><br />The second time I went back was in the middle of the day and too many people were there questing and trying to get the pet to spawn, and some were just hovering overhead waiting to swoop down. I hung around for 5 or 10 minutes and left.<br /><br />Just now I decided to swing through before going to the darkmoon faire. No other players were in the area (it was around 4:45 AM here) and there was an emerald proto whelp just sitting there for the taking and it was in the southern part of the savage thicket near no enemies, just a few critters, while the first I got spawned in the north.<br /><br />I'm beginning to doubt if the killing of enemies has anything to do with the spawning, but I'm just happy I now have 2 of these awesome pets. Will definitely be coming back for a third. Based on my experience, camping them is probably a waste of time. Try a few short trips here and there. In any case, it's much better than trying to farm whelps in feralas for that retardedly low drop rate, and these emerald proto whelps are worth it.<br /><br />One more note about how powerful they are, I can level 2 other pets in draenor with the emerald proto whelp in the third battle pet slot fighting level 25 enemiesâ€”this is very easy in shadowmoon valley where you get level 23-25 and lots of moths. The whelp will sometimes 1-shot the moths! I just always have it use Emerald Presence shield, and maybe heal 1-3 times during the battle. If you use one of those training biscuits you can quickly level 2 petsâ€”and don't worry about the rarity. You can easily buy an upgrade stone from your garrison menagerie to make it rare for a measly 15 charms, and I was lucky enough to win a dragonkin upgrade stone while doing the daily battles.<br /><br />Anyway, just my thoughts. Badass battle pet worth the time to get.<br /><br />EDIT: After I wrote this another one had spawned on the middle east side, which I battled and captured. Then I went up to the north part and another one was there. Not sure what the spawn times are related to now, they may be random timers, or timers that change based on time of day and number of players. There was one other player there and neither of us had killed anything, so <b>these spawns had nothing to do with killing the mobs</b>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thrope</b></h3>Abuse mechanics! This pet will help you.<br /><br />With so many <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/petspecies=5">critters</a> out in the world, a survivable beast attacker for your farming/leveling team is a must. But this leaves one weakness: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/petspecies=3">fliers</a>, the 3rd most common pet you'll encounter. Frequently, you'll want a dragonkin (resistant to flying abilities) with magic attacks (strong against fliers) and plenty of sustain.<br /><br />A p/p Emerald Proto-Whelp is your best friend!<br /><br />Everyone knows power improves your damage from <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/petability=525">Emerald Bite</a>. But power does a lot more, and this pet exploits the hidden strengths of power TWICE! <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/petability=597">Emerald Presence</a> blocks more per attack the more power you have. It's not based on health, or speed, and it's not arbitrary. It's based on power. The higher your power, the less damage you take. <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/petability=598">Emerald Dream</a> (your only available heal if you choose Emerald Presence, thus giving you sustain) also heals more based on POWER!<br /><br />Your p/p whelp will only have 1400 health, which might lead people to believe it isn't tanky. Its health is not its strength. This pet has the mitigation &amp; heals to make that health go further than any dragonkin in the game! It's even better than the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=7545">Emerald Whelpling</a>. Whelpling sacrifices fewer turns to heal, but it just doesn't have the power to compete with this pet. Not only will its lower power result in less DPS, it will also ensure the whelpling sacrifices more time to mitigation &amp; healing, because both of these are based on your power.<br /><br />Many dragonkin pets have some pretty amazing uses, but if you're looking for a pet to fill out your farming/leveling team, the p/p Emerald Proto-Whelp is exactly what you're looking for. If Legion has a pet which will usurp it... Well, we'll see...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SiliconX</b></h3>If you're just getting started into pet battling, the P/P breed of this pet should be the first pet you level.

So I got on my mage alt and teleported to Dalaran and went to find one, only this time there were NONE! I flew around for 15-20 minutes, and I was baffled, because last time I was here there were plenty. I decided to server hop, to see if I could find any doing that.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TevishSzat</b></h3>As of this writing, the Emerald Proto-Whelp is one of the most important battle pets you can obtain in order to face harder PvE challenges, given its unmatched ability to both sustain and recover. In particular, the Tiny Terrors can all be bested by two pets specific to the lead enemy and the Proto-Whelp as a third pet to deal with whatever they had in the back line. What's more, the Emerald Proto-Whelp does not appear to be particularly difficult to locate at this time. This means you can have your choice of breed: I prefer P/P but any breed will do.<br /><br />The key to a happy Proto-Whelp lies in the combination of Emerald Presence and Emerald Dream. Emerald Presence, having 100% uptime, is what makes the Proto-Whelp good at sustaining itself against attrition damage: Average attacks will be blunted while multiple weaker strikes such as Swarm may be negated entirely. Emerald Dream, on the other hand, will erase what damage does get through presence -- very few foes, at least in the wild, are capable of doing enough damage over Emerald Presence to keep you from topping off entirely with Emerald Dream. Whether you take Breath or Emerald Bite is a matter of taste, but I generally favor Emerald Bite as Flying pets are far more common than Magical in the wild and Undead and Mechanical are similarly rare.<br /><br />While the bane of the Tiny Terrors and significantly hostile to the elite Pandaria pets, the Proto-Whelp's utility falls off in PvP where forced-swap, stuns, humanoids, and high-damage combos are the order of the day. However, since the side dish of the day is the multi-hit-extra-damage team, which Emerald Presence nerfs almost entirely out of existence, the Proto-Whelp can still find some purchase on PvP teams that aren't setting up for any particular combo (or are doing it in two pets) as a counter play. The Anubisath Idol may be more tanky while its out, but the Proto-Whelp can actually come back from taking burst damage on its own while the Anubisath will need some help if anything meaningful gets through the sandstorm wall. Taking both, possibly with another extremely durable pet like the Ruby Droplet or Magical Crawdad, is a way to have a good win-rate in PvP Pet battles, though I hesitate to say it's a good way owing that the battles will take an awfully long time as all mentioned pets are, naturally, lacking in the offense department.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ChristinePi</b></h3>I can confirm that killing the primordial drakes makes it spawn. It worked twice for me. It probably would have worked more than twice but I got lucky with getting a rare whelp on my second try.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>cynalise</b></h3>I was looking around for a few minutes and killed drakes, etc, and nothing spawned. I left myself afk for a bit to go finish some stuff and when I came back the area was full of them. I mean there were at least 6-7 flying around. That was all between about 7-7:30am server. Not sure what caused it, but it wasn't just 1 or 2 that spawned at a time. No rares, but I did get to pick up 2 P/P and 1 uncommon P/S. Not bad.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lv100Shuckle</b></h3>Am I doing something wrong? I've come here for no less than 2 hours a day every day for over a week. I have yet to see a single one. I've flown in a circle, I've sat and camped, I've killed dragon mobs, I've killed other bpets, I've killed critters. Nothing works. I am on Stormrage and have never even seen so much as a whisper of this thing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MEzecs</b></h3>After trying to capture one of these for the past week and not seeing a single one (murdering all the dragons/eggs nearby didn't help and I don't see why it would, nor did killing the other pets in the zone) I logged in at 5:30am and there were about 10 of these dotted around the thicket. 4 of them were P/P so it doesn't seem to be a rare breed, no blues though.<br /><br />If you're trying to catch one of these try logging on super early!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Asere</b></h3>Trying to catch on of these guys was a pain but finally, one sunny Wednesday morning I was lucky to fly in and find a bunch had spawned. Got a rare within the first 3 - 4 attempts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ThePKX</b></h3>If you're trying to catch this for the new Wailing Caverns pet dungeon, instead of waiting for these to spawn you can simply join Rift of Aln in LFR Emerald Nightmare and catch <a href="/npc=97206/dream-whelpling">Dream Whelpling</a> instead: has the same 3 core abilities but is a guaranteed spawn after you kill the boss.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>avatarofshadow</b></h3>I just grabbed some of these today. There were a LOT of them in The Savage Thicket area of Sholazar Basin. I hopped onto an engineer and ported right there, early this morning. <br />Some info I'm not sure if anyone shared is that they're level 21, and are usually accompanied by a pair of snakes, though it can be other things. When you catch them, they'll go down to level 19. So, be prepared to level them up a bit before you use them. There were two other people catching them while I was, but we were all nice enough to stay out of each others' way. This is another piece of good advice. Treat other pet collectors the way you want them to treat you. It doesn't ALWAYS work out, but it always feels better than the alternative.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cangrejoloco207</b></h3>Found tons of these at 9:00 a.m. Had no luck at night.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kyrgune</b></h3>No need to wait until morning hours.<br /><br />I saw two of them close together at night (Argent Dawn server) so not sure if Blizzard changed something, but I had no problems capturing one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ChadCloman</b></h3><b>An update for 2018:</b><br /><br />I tried the &quot;kill everything in the area&quot; method. Didn't work.<br /><br />I tried the &quot;kill all the pets in the zone&quot; method. Didn't work.<br /><br />I finally decided to try server-hopping via groupfinder, and when I got to the location, there were a ton of Emerald Proto-whelps spawned. So I got lucky.<br /><br />I'm still not sure what actually causes these to spawn, but I can state the following:<br /><ul><li>It's not killing the NPCs.</li><li>It's not killing the other pets in the zone.</li><li>It's not a single spawn, like another comment stated. There were at least 10 of them, possibly more.</li><li>The time of day was approximately 11pm Eastern.</li></ul><br /><br />I believe that server-hopping via groupfinder will probably be the best method of finding these pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bgbngtheory</b></h3>Was about to quit (of course, like any good hunter does) and decided to kill a bunch of stuff. Came back here to read about the latest catches and looked back at my map to find one sitting at (47,23) He was a poor quality P/P. Captured it and mounted up, going to Flight Path and saw ANOTHER at (46,33) and was also poor quality P/P. Was thrilled with this that I decided to make one more quick pass and found another (somewhere between the other two that I already captured but forgot to write coordinates down) and it was poor quality P/S.<br /><br />Needless to say, THRILLED to death that I decided to kill a bunch of stuff around.<br />Total time spent farming was probably less than an hour. VERY lucky!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MichelleLisa</b></h3>I went to the spawn area today, 2.30 pm ST (US Frostmourne). There were between 8-12, none of which were rare quality; <i>however</i>, I did manage to catch 3 x P/P breeds. The rest were P and P/S. <br /><br />Thanks to the BFA world quests, I have been stock-piling the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=98715/marked-flawless-battle-stone">Marked Flawless Battle-Stone</a>s which now means I have a rare P/P Emerald Proto-Whelp! Easy!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gladly</b></h3>After sitting in the area a bit, logging over to toons on other servers to no avail, then coming back an hour or so later after doing some chores around home, found and captured the only spawn at 49.08, 26.70 in Sholazar (Savage Thicket area) at 4:58pm EST/server time. I didn't kill any mobs or critters, since most comments here suggested that didn't work, I just waited around for a spawn more or less.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Daemordrath</b></h3>i got PP after about 10 PB breeds in a row. Go for breed and ignore the rarity</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kyukket</b></h3>there were a ton of them out today...most common breed was definitely P/S, with P a distant 2nd and P/P definitely the rarest (have never seen balance, are they real? LOL)! no rares, but that what pet charms and stones are for</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>shoutingboy</b></h3>For what it's worth, as of now (late 2020) there's no shortage of them in the Savage Thicket. Flew there and I found like 5 waiting to be caught.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nordbunny</b></h3>Arrived at spawning area to find many whelps, then as midday (server time) arrived they all despawned. I guess there's a time dependency.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Greenlit88</b></h3>I went to get my first one yesterday and there were 3 or 4 flying around so I figured they must not be that hard to get so I got one and logged off for the day. Now today I'm trying to get a better quality and can't find one haha lame.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kilrathi3</b></h3>currently are level 22 .. easy enough</div>
