<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ardinur</b></h3>This pet is added in patch 5.3, and drops from <a href="http://ptr.wowhead.com/npc=69282">Quivering Filth</a> (the large elite one). <br /><br />It used to be bugged, and would not drop at all, but is now hotfixed and can drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rossmallo</b></h3>&quot;Battle pet trainers are strongly encouraged to wash their hands for at least 30 minutes after playing with the filthling.&quot;<br /><br />...Better question, Why would anyone want to play with it in the first place?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Buckmoney</b></h3>It's very %^&amp;*ty.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shashos</b></h3>Killed just over 500 Quivering Filth mobs over several hours and nothing yet. Bad RNG, or the drop rate on this is fairly low.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shashos</b></h3>The drop on this pet is currently bugged, per CM Mumper on Twitter:<br /><br />&quot;We found the issue with the Filthling drop bug. A hotfix is in progress. Thanks for the reports!&quot;<br /><br /><a href="https://twitter.com/mumper/status/337622142483042304" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/mumper/status/337622142483042304</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shinijumi</b></h3>This pet has been hotfixed today (5/23/2013), and now has a chance to drop from the ELITE Quivering Filth mobs in the Crag. Back to farming!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1122269</b></h3>4155 kills on quivering Filth and it drop <br />3001 kills in 1st day<br />and 1154 2nd day..<br /><br />pet no 499.. happy shamy :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dontrike</b></h3>So after the hotfix yesterday I decided to go back and kill them, killed any of them I could for about 30 minutes, 115 based off of the loot in my bags, and got one, then another 4 were also in the loot from all of them. It does seem like the elite versions of the oozes drop the pet. I killed about a dozen of the elites if I remember correctly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>oronare</b></h3>A good tip I saw on the actual mobs wowhead page, is that you can &quot;force&quot; the large Oozes to spawn by killing all of the smaller ones in the area. Not sure if lucky, but just AOEing them all down I had about 6 large ones spawn within 10 minutes, one of which dropped the pet.<br /><br />Something to consider if you want to try and quickly farm the pet =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Neryssa</b></h3>This pet has a idle effect where it literally covers you in poop - <a href="/spell=142661/filthy">Filthy</a>.<br /><br />He pukes on you, makes your character all orange and leaves you with a 10s debuff that just saws, &quot;Ewwww!&quot;. He does it quite often.<br /><br />He's one of my favorite idle pets. I appropriately named mine, Quest Item.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1069964</b></h3>I didn't find the drop rates themselves so low. What <b>can</b> actually be a little boring is waiting for the elite mobs to spawn. I don't know if it actually helps or if it was just a coincidence, but I killed several small ones to try to force the large ones to spawn. They did spawn a little faster than usual, and in about 6-8 kills, I got my pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>crepngdeath</b></h3>Gotten four of these the last two days aoe all of the mobs until elite spawns repeat this until elite drops the pet easy peasy</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>618470</b></h3>One thing worth noting is that this little bastard is an absolute <i>horror</i> to get past level 1. It's level 1 ability is Dreadful Breath, which does a measily <i>ten</i> damage. And because it's a three-round ability, you can't just switch it out against higher level mobs, because it dies. I had so much frustration with mine, as even level 1 white critters around Silvermoon City could kill it with ease due to it's pathetic damage output. I eventually had to go out and find a level 1 grey-quality wild pet to go against, and even then I only just managed to win, due to the wild pet missing three times in a row.<br /><br />Dear god. Why. Why give this ability to a level 1. Once it's level 2, it gets easier, as you can just do the normal boosting thing, relying on the Magic pet's passive to not get 1-shotted against higher levels, just that initial level... God-<b>damn</b>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Palathos</b></h3>Why is it shown at Cape of Stranglethorn when it is from the TCG?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>537977</b></h3>This pet can be a bit tricky to get started with. Due to its level one attack being a 3 ROUND attack, the usual tactic having your level one pet start, do one round of damage then swap out for your level 25s does not work as you can't swap him out during his three round channeled attack, meaning he'll inevitably get killed before you can swap him out. <br /><br />However, what is possible is that if you just simply pass on your first round, this pet will still get the XP, having never actually used an ability. It seems that the pet just needs to be present in the fight for a single round to get the XP boost, whether it uses an ability or not. <br /><br />Took me a few pet bandages to work this out and I was getting annoyed that I would have to (oh the horror!) go find actual pet mobs its same level to get it to level 2.<br /><br />Hope this helps!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Velaya</b></h3>As I'm never lucky with drops, this seems to have a high droprate.<br /><br />I just killed 3 big Oozes in about 5 minutes and got 2 Filthlings.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Paralyse</b></h3>Anecdotal evidence only -- please do not downrate, this is not intended to prove anything.<br /><br />Today was farming this for grins while working on Isle achievements.<br /><br />315 total kills<br />24 elite kills<br />4 total Filthling drops<br /><br />All 4 drops came from the Elites.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1242704</b></h3>was waiting for Progenitus to kill him on achiev, it took him too long to spawn so I went to check something else and saw this giant yellow blob, killed it and received filthling, yay!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AveryZan</b></h3>Took me about 45 mins to farm this little beauty. I got some rep I needed for the legendary in the process and some stuff that sold a lot to the vendor. All in all not a bad spot to farm.<br />Make sure to give this guy pet biscuits so he can become the Great Mighty Poo! <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5neFPat1w" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5neFPat1w</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Whoopee</b></h3>I just made a video on where you can get this pet from<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eWEhndhP1I" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eWEhndhP1I</a><br /><br />toke me over 2 hours of grinding, but people saying their can get it within 30mins. but from the feedback in these comments the 2 hour range seems normal.
