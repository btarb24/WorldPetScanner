So fighting other pets in the hope of finding a Snowy Owl as added pet will NOT work.\n\nI've staked out 12 Snowy Owl spawns (after fighting them) for over 30 minutes, and found out none of the spawn places spawned ANY replacement critter\/battlepet.\nThis, and the fact that most other spawns related to a spawning condition DO NOT share their spawnpoints with other battlepets, makes me believe that Snowy Owls are a seperate spawn.\n\nThis means that it's of no use to kill other battlepets\/critters to try to get them to spawn. Tested this with 2 or 3 other persons in Winterspring. We all kept killing critters and saw 0 spawns for quite a long time.

I've personally found that there's an oasis in Barrens where fishing out the last pool in the pond causes one to pop up in another part of the pond.

Another player!\" \r\nBeer dive-bombs straight at the owl as the other player's blip on the map suddenly changes direction straight at the owl. The Cenarion Hippogriff slams down on top of the birdy and Beer right-clicks it: the battle has begun!\r\n\"Oh-my-god!\" the Snowy Owl's nameplate shines a beautiful royal blue. \"Honey! It's a Rare!\" Beer can barely control his trembling, the stakes have just gotten MUCH higher!  The wife's Arcane Eye opens with a blast and barely scratches the owl. The bird responds by knocking 20% off the Eyes health with a single blow.  The pets trade hits back and forth as Beer struggles to get the Owl's health low enough to throw the trap.  [i]Almost there...[\/i] The Eye falls to the snow - defeated.  The second eye moves up, scores a hit and the Trap icon glows. Beer throws it - missed! \"Crap!\"  The Owl responds to the insult by summoning a Cyclone - the last Eye and the Restless Shadeling are about to get chewed to pieces. The Eye hits the Owl feebly once more to get the trap to stick, [i]Throw it! Throw it![\/i] \"Yes!\" the trap snaps down on the prize.  Now to deal with the adds: a Rabid Nut Varmint 5000 and an Alpine Hare.  Beer swallows hard, yes, this IS getting ugly! The Eye holds it own for a while against the mech - even killing it, but gets killed itself when the RNV5000 rezzes.  The Restless Shadeling glides up and finishes the mech for good, now for the Hare.  Beer's pulse races as the Shadeling and Hare trade blows and the Shadeling's health dwindles, \"C'mon dammit! Hit harder!\"\r\nSo how does the story end? Did Iwannabeer log off in the wilderness, log into the love-of-his-life's account, port and fly across two continents only to have her three highest level pets go down in shameful defeat?  Or did he narrowly snatch a glorious victory from the blood-stained snow with a Rare-quality, very-hard-to-find and beautiful battle pet as a gift for his beloved?  Beer smiles, \" I ain't saying...\" :)","date":"2013-02-10T00:17:34-06:00","rating":173,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Upvoted.

This year it did not begin to spawn until June 21[\/b][\/u] - the official beginning of summer in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nSo I'm gonna quit camping Winterspring for now (although I may check from time to time), but I WILL be there at 12:05 am on December 21!\n\n[b]EDIT:  See Bassboater69's response from a GM - these will start to spawn DECEMBER 21![u][\/u][\/b]","date":"2013-11-02T13:06:06-05:00","rating":35,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"If this follows the actual solstice, it will be 5:11 UT on the 21st.","creationdate":"2013-11-02T16:02:51-05:00","id":705352,"rating":1,"commentid":1914284,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"jazzzman","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"I wish I knew when the official \"rainy season\" was, so I could camp Cape of Stranglethorn a lot harder for the Baby Ape...","creationdate":"2013-12-20T17:07:51-06:00","id":715944,"rating":5,"commentid":1914284,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"LTygress","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2013-11-02T14:24:50-05:00",4,"carens"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":94,"id":1914319,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Kheffe","body":"Seems like we'll have to wait until Dec. 21st","date":"2013-11-02T15:02:02-05:00","rating":83,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"people downrate this, and he's actually right. they see a stupid person in the mirror now","creationdate":"2013-11-03T21:49:50-06:00","id":705683,"rating":-10,"commentid":1914319,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"dudu2k","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":95,"id":1914685,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Blurrry","body":"Soooooo, when now?

Finally I decided that they apparently must not spawn as secondaries, as none showed up after trying about 30 or 40 times. So I started just killing anything and everything that was a battle pet and not a Snowy Owl battle pet in the whole area of Mazthoril. \n\nAfter slaughtering about 45 battle pets (NOT by fighting them, that takes too long, by just killing them straight up) I came back around to where I initially started my killing, and sure enough, a Snowy Owl had spawned! Very first one I saw, and I engaged it, and it was a rare, Power\/Balance. Came with a Mountain Skunk and an Alpine Hare, I believe. I was delighted. \n\nSo my advice is to just kill off every critter in the Mazthoril area that's not a Snowy Owl, as I can't say for sure if the Owl can and will spawn as a secondary pet, but if it does, the odds of it happening are really low. You're better off clearing the critters until a Snowy Owl spawns. \n\n90 minutes of battling pets to see if a Snowy Owl was there as a secondary, and when it wasn't finishing the battle anyway for XP for my pets, vs. 10 minutes of killing everything and then following the same circular path I took killing them all and a Snowy Owl had popped up in place of a rabbit or something that was there before. Much better and more time efficient to do it this way. \n\nAnd as far as me being super lucky and getting a rare on my first one; a) No matter what it was I was going to use one of my dozen flying battle stones to upgrade it if it wasn't already blue anyway, and b) I've had my super sized share of bad luck farming pets, such as spending literally 12 hours grinding out mobs in Feralas at 10 mobs a minute trying to get the Sprite Darter Hatchling. I ended up with over 2,000 silk cloth, like 7 blues, 100 greens, and a serious headache before I gave up and bought the damn thing off the AH. So don't envy my luck with the owl, hahaha, I've had plenty of terrible luck elsewhere :P\n\nHappy Hunting!\n\nP.S. - I later found a few Snowy Owls near the entrance into Winterspring, on the far West side, you know, where the Furbolg tunnel comes out, Timbermaw Hold. There were a few in that area between the tunnel exit and Donova Snowden and the Frostfire Hotsprings, like if you drew a triangle between those 3 points, there were several owls inside that area. \n\nP.P.S. - I was initially searching around Mazthoril due to the many comments suggesting that area. However, I later found 4 or 5 Snowy Owls in the Northern wing of the map, like north of Starfall Village all the way up to Frostsaber Rock, on both sides of the road. And I'm on a very high pop server, Tichondrius. So it might be worth forgetting about Mazthoril initially and looking in these two other places I found Snowy Owls up and about; this one and the one I mentioned in the first P.S.","date":"2014-01-01T00:39:05-06:00","rating":8,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"This works.

I searched for about 30 min and finally stumbled upon one just SW of Starfall Village. I entered combat and caught it rather quickly. Most of you would assume this is where my story ends, but sadly it is not. As I was about to land the final blow to the 3rd pet, I was trolled on a level I have never been trolled before, when a 93 hunter hit me and ended my pet battle. Because I am 100, he was clearly just trolling me and he quickly used his glider to escape combat... I caught up to him only to be \/loled at mercilessly. I am only withholding his character name because I want this post to get upvoted. I want to petition Blizzard to make players unattackable while in a pet battle. This has ALWAYS been a tremendous inconvenience, and it is in no way fair- even for the sake of fairly matched pvp because you can get torn up before you even fully exit the pet battle screen. Most importantly, however, it seems to be a mechanic that exists for the sole purpose of letting players troll one another out of rare pets, which I cannot stand. My story ends here, hours later, owl-less and still searching. Upvote this if this has happened to you, or you would like to see this mechanic removed from the game.\n\nEDIT: Finally caught one just south of the \"O\" in Mazthroil.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>154060</b></h3>If this is a Winter pet then it will not show up until Winter, which doesn't start until December 21st.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jamesoliff</b></h3><b>Time period of winter</b><br />Astronomically, it starts with the winter solstice (around December 21 in the Northern Hemisphere and June 21 in the Southern Hemisphere), and ends with the spring equinox (around March 21 in the Northern Hemisphere and September 21 in the Southern Hemisphere). In meteorology, it is by convention counted instead as the whole months of June, July and August in the Southern Hemisphere and December, January and February in the Northern Hemisphere.<br /><br />However, in the United Kingdom and Ireland the winter solstice is traditionally considered as midwinter, the winter season beginning November 1.<br /><br />In otherwords we have to wait and see because no matter which way you look at it, its Autumn at the moment.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Grukam</b></h3>Beautiful, crystal clear night in Winterspring. Cold but not bitterly so. The full moon glowing over the mountains and not a Snowy Owl to be seen anywhere. Leads me to believe like a number of other battle pets certain conditions apply for them to spawn. Check back when it's snowing.</div>

Taking a flight path cos I was too lazy to fly and scrolling over the paws on the ground I suddenly saw it there. Hiking back he was there clear as day and lovely to see. Was 1252am in Winterspring. Snowing. Tiny bit south of Timbermaw Hold. I am thinking it was the snow and night time that was needed (being an owl I guess that makes sense).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1051249</b></h3>There seems to be an abundance this morning (US Dath'Remar). Almost as many owls as there are chipmunks. I mostly looked in the south of Winterspring on my way to the daily. <br />Was there before and after nine (so it's not really day/night-time on the server related) and they were all over the place. Wasn't snowing, didn't have to go in any caves or anything special. It is possible there was a bug that got fixed, or people simply overculling trying to get a rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>904006</b></h3>A few minutes ago, I entered Winterspring to check for this little bird and it was the first battle pet I met. I guess the winter begins on 1/11 for Blizzard, after all. Anyways, it's up now, gogo and get yours!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vizime</b></h3>One thing is sure, it is not bugged. Maybe the spawn rates are crap because of CRZ, but I just caught one at 34.49, 49.02 in Winterspring at 7:14 AM Amsterdam time. I am sure that if you fly around Winterspring you can easily spot this pet. I am not sure if it has spawn times and despawn times. <br /><br />Edit: I flew around and its full of these pets, at least at this time. (7:17 AM) I have only seen Snowy Owls as first pet, can't confirm (and never saw) Snowy Owl as secondary or third pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Solmyre</b></h3>Just found one on Terenas-EU at the Hidden Grove (62, 24). 7:16 Server time 1/11/2012.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Perrilyn</b></h3>I just caught one (and a rare, at that!) around 12:30 AM server time, November 1st, on Blackwater Raiders. I didn't notice any weather changes - it was just flying around near the Frostfire Hot Springs. Either the bug was fixed, or this is just a very, very rare spawn - but they DO show up!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zemmix</b></h3>These spawned exactly at 12am server time on November 1st. There were no owls up at 11:59pm. As soon as the clock struck 12 I saw the spawns appear. It was not snowing at all so they are not tied to weather.<br /><br />Unfortunately it looks like these may be on a rather long respawn timer. All spawns are gone now and it's been 30 minutes without any respawns.<br /><br />Edit: At around 6am server time I checked and found a few had respawned. So they do respawn but there wasn't as many new spawns as there were at 12am when they first spawned. I found around 5 total new spawns. One of which was rare. If you are on a high pop server I have a feeling this will be hard to farm. Around Giraffe Calf rarity it seems to me unless more spawn later.<br /><br />So in short:<br />-Does not appear as a secondary<br />-Long respawn timer (~6 hours)<br />-Not dependent on any weather effects<br />-Doesn't share spawns with other critters. Killing the other battle pets doesn't seem to effect their spawn at all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Perrilyn</b></h3>After exploring Winterspring a bit more, here's what I've found out:<br /><br />The Snowy Owl does not appear to spawn at all until November. Its spawns are not weather-dependent (no snowstorms needed!); nor does it seem to be a particularly rare spawn (I spotted three or four in fifteen minutes). It appears to be a primary spawn pet only; I haven't encountered it as a secondary in battle. It's a pretty white owl with blueish tail feathers, and when you click it, it hoots. Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1051356</b></h3>Okay. My first foray for a while into Winterspring and I nailed a Snowy Owl. I don't have co-ordinates but can confirm I tamed it just north of the path from Timbermaw Hold to Starfall Village, roughly where the road dissects south to Lake Klutheril. Anachros 09:03 server time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Crusi</b></h3>i can confirm, the snowy owls have appeared! go go catch!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1051412</b></h3>Found one just above Frostsaber Rock in the NW corner of Winterspring. Early morning. It was a poor, so I flew the rest of the zone looking for others and never found another. Happy hunting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>367644</b></h3>Just caught my first one today, an Uncommon. It was the only one I found at the time and I only saw one other person there.<br /><br />They have a really slow spawn time and there's not many around. CRZ are going to make it even harder to get. Make sure you do a few laps around Winterspring if you haven't found one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>44515</b></h3>NOTE: This pet only spawns from November 1st until Februari 28th (or maybe 29th in a leap year).<br />They don't have any additional spawning conditions such as time of day/weather. The only requirement is it being winter in WoW.<br />Also, they only come as a primary pet. So fighting other pets in the hope of finding a Snowy Owl as added pet will NOT work.<br /><br />I've staked out 12 Snowy Owl spawns (after fighting them) for over 30 minutes, and found out none of the spawn places spawned ANY replacement critter/battlepet.<br />This, and the fact that most other spawns related to a spawning condition DO NOT share their spawnpoints with other battlepets, makes me believe that Snowy Owls are a seperate spawn.<br /><br />This means that it's of no use to kill other battlepets/critters to try to get them to spawn. Tested this with 2 or 3 other persons in Winterspring. We all kept killing critters and saw 0 spawns for quite a long time. Eventualy we gave up on killing other critters, about 15 minutes later they suddenly popped up on a few locations in Winterspring. Some of which weren't even being farmed/killed by anyone before.<br /><br />Additionaly, as has been stated by others, the spawn timer on these is relatively long. (Though not Minfernal/Scourged Whelpling long). So be prepared for it to take a while to get any rarity owl, and for it to take quite long (possibly days/weeks of camping) to find a rare (unless you're lucky)<br /><br />TLDR: Spawns aren't shared with other critters, just fly around and hope to get lucky.<br /><br /></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>351322</b></h3>They are definitely spawning now, and it does appear that it requires your realm to be in November 1st. On my server my local time was after midnight, but the CRZ time was three hours behind, and no snowy owls were out. Finally once it went over midnight on the CRZ time in Winterspring, they showed up. There seems to be three or four per quadrant of the zone; the zone is more or less three sections, so they are sparse, but there. Even then, their scarcity is probably just from the number of players out running around looking for one, or for a rare. Rares exist as well, I got mine up in the northern edge of the zone, East of the Wintersaber rock. Good hunting.</div>

I only found it in three places when I had a peek in Winterspring.<br />-West of the Hidden Grove (at about 55,30 - within the purplish shaded part of the map)<br />-Frostwhisper Gorge<br /><br />...and I'm afraid I'm not quite sure where the third was, because I finally caught it and I was excited so I sort of took off before checking. I think it was between Lake Kel'theril and Mazthoril though. <s>I uploaded some data using the Wowhead client after encountering them, so hopefully a map with pins will show up soon.</s> Edit: Yay, these are the dataz we were looking for :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>fenriradra</b></h3>found 2 of these (both poor quality) within 40 yards of each other, just south of Frostwhisper Gorge before the zone crossing into the low lying twilight area of Mt.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aliandrin</b></h3>Important Note: It <b>is</b> possible to be phased out of the Snowy Owls.<br /><br />After taking the flight point to Winterspring while tracking battle pets and seeing the area plastered thick with them - and <i>not</i> being able to see any of them at all while patrolling the same area on my mount - I was perplexed.<br /><br />&quot;Oh, someone else must have greedy-grabbed every last one!&quot; I thought to myself. &quot;Blast you, cross-realm zones, you've foiled my plans yet again!&quot;<br /><br />So what do I do but hop back on the flight point back to Orgrimmar. And as I go, what do I see below me on track battle pets but no less than <i>twelve more</i> precious, precious Snowy Owls!<br /><br />I'm so incredibly stupid that it took taking the flight point once more right back to Winterspring and <i>seeing one vanish before my eyes as I get off the flight point</i> for me to realise what was going on... <b>Phased</b>. Likely, this is because I did a few quests in Winterspring for transmogrification pieces and left many quest lines started but as of yet, unfinished.<br /><br /><b>You can still obtain an Owl.</b><br /><br />There are places in Winterspring - Namely Frostwhisper Gorge - where you can see the battle pets in adjoining zones <i>even if you're phased</i>. Straddle the zone border between plain Winterspring and Frostwhisper Gorge; there's at least one Owl spawn point there that's near enough to the Gorge for you to zip in quick, click the Owl, and start a battle before it realises you oughtn't be able to have that Owl.<br /><br />If you see those great blue ice giants vanishing and reappearing as you head South, you're straddling the zone <i>just right</i>.<br /><br />If this doesn't work (though it did for me) it might have to do with the exact phase you're in. Try straddling other zones in Winterspring.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1054158</b></h3>So I've just got my rare one in like less than I hour.I should got it earlier that that,but my first rare one just lost from losing the battle.First I got frustrated,but just when I was completeing a quest,a little green paw appeared on my mini-map,and I finally caught it.So I got at arund 6:40 pm on server time.The reason I got it so fast is because there weren't so many people around the Winterspring for sure,and also I can comfirmed that killing/battleling other battle pets did cause the snowy owls to respawn,cause I' ve flew around there for 20mins and I found a poor one on the bottom part,and later on,i capture my second rare one on the third time I've parked there.And that was after I've killed/battled 8 chipmunks, 7 hares,and 5 spiders in the whole Winterspring area.But I don't know if this 100% worked,I think I was lucky,cause I read the comments,and seemed like it was so hard for capture a rare one,but I found it just in 10 mins.<br /> Also,I would like to pull out the status for this cute creature<br />HP 922<br />Atk 164<br />speed 206<br />Lv16(after caught)before was 17,and be considered that the status after caught won't stayed as the same.My first rare one got about 183atk power,and I think that should be the highest atk power(desired..) <br />I also want to give some hints for this pet<br />As far as I found out,most of them spawn around the Everlook,which can be good or bad,u'll just pray that there weren't so many people around.<br />Be aware of the add-on pets,since the higher-level areas always have two more pets joined in the battle,especially look out for the spiders,they got a crzy ability called brittle webbing,and it can killed almost every types of pets,except for the flying pets,the damage your pet would take from this ability is 40 damage,and onced your pet attacked,they lost 40 hp,which means you need to have a healer,or a tank-pet such as turtle,crab with shield ability and high hp, don't use critters,trust me,the snowy owl is way faster than them.What I suggested is to bring a mechanical pet to counter these spiders, and have a tank to take damage from brittle webbing, I don't suggest to use the mchanical pet for the owls,because they are so fast,and even your level is higher,they still can take half hp from you..Last thing, you need to bring magic pets for sure,but make sure they are at least lv 15,or they can easily got killed,the only magic pets have is jade ozziling and nether faerie dragon, I choose a fast speed dragon because they got evanescence <br />that can blocked an attack for one turn,(it it's faster than the other,it can last two turns),also it take 30% damage less from the beasts,and they are faster than other when their ho is higher or above 50%.What you need to do is use the magic ability to attack the owls until they got 25% hp.And switched your powerful tank for the spiders.<br />Don't camp for that,not worth,it's not so rare on spawn rate,at least way better than that dumb Minfernal..Do somethings else,questing,mining,herbing,or even gaining rep with timbermaw hold is a lot ot fun than that.<br />Confirmed:most snowy owls come up with at least one spider followed,(killing me..)<br />Since it's a new pet to catch,I 'm not sure if the information is right or not.But I hope this can help some people. ^ ^ BTW: did Jaguero Isle ever rained!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>CardinalFlyer</b></h3>I believe these guys have a low incidence random spawn shared with the other pets. On my first pass around winterspring, I found none. I started battling every pet encountered. Upgraded my robochick. On the next pass I found 6 snowy owls. The fifth was a rare. I left the sixth. Perhaps they were just random spawns on the long timer, but it definitely did seem to help to go take out all the other pets and force respawns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>795337</b></h3>I've been through WS several times now, covering the entire area and have not seen a single Snowy Owll! I've killed critters in the hopes of forcing a spawn and I've embattled many critters in the area in the hopes of getting one as a secondary and still nothing. <br />So what's the dealio with these guys?<br />1) does it have to be &quot;snowing&quot; for them to appear? <br />or<br />2) the info stated above for these guys suggests that there's a tie in with the furbolg and I vaguely remember completing a quest where I had to collect feathers for them. This leads me to believe that maybe a quest I completed a long time ago makes them phased to me? But that's grasping at staws<br /><br />So, any other ideas are welcome, at this rate I feel like I may have a better chance at finding a Minfernal than a Snowy owl :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aquifel</b></h3>Just did a fly through of Winterspring, to check on the population of these owls, took 2 fights to get a rare, then stopped battling, but kept flying just to see how many were in zone, i counted about 7 in my fly through.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>vampirechickk</b></h3><b>TIPS:</b><ol><li>The Snowy Owls Have a Rather Large Spawn Timer. From my experience, I have seen some spawn just under 3 hrs.. but the average seems to be 6. Don't fret, there are lots of spawn spots that you can see via way points listed on Wowhead and ones below.</li><li>The Snowy Owls are seasonal and will only be up from September 22 (but a bug made them spawn November 1st) through March 19th (first day of spring is March 20th)</li><li>The Snowy Owls will NOT show up as a 2nd or 3rd battle pet so trying to catch a rare is usually more time consuming.</li><li>Word is getting out that these owls are seasonal, sought after and the rares are more difficult to capture. So try hunting them at low population times.</li><li>Killing other Wild Pets or Owls does not seem to make them spawn faster so I wouldn't waste your time.</li><li>Kill any hostiles near the Snowy Owl before fight (Do NOT use AOEs! It will kill owl) so you do not get interrupted and possibly loose the owl to other players or due to lack of pet health (just in case pet healing is on CD and you are out of bandages).</li><li>Enter in /reload ui if you are in a battle and the animations freeze. It will unfreeze the animation and let you continue the battle (as long as your last surviving pet didn't die during animation). I have had this happen to me several times when fighting against a Flying pet.</li><li>Don't be stubborn or use lag as an excuse. Get the Addons I listed below! They will save soooo much time!</li></ol><br /><br /><b>VERY Helpful Addons for Poor-Rare Snowy Owl Hunting:</b><br /><ul><li><b><i><u>Battle Pet Quality Notifier</u></i></b> (Lists Quality of 1st, 2nd, 3rd Pet when a Battle is Initiated and if you currently own one or the wild pet is an upgrade.)</li><li><b><i><u>TomTom</u></i></b> (Will Set Waypoints on map via Macro and give you Coordinates to view)</li></ul><br /><br />It took me about a week from 3-7 hrs a day to find a rare.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1056365</b></h3>Found one flying directly south of Frostfire Hot Springs along the south edge of the zone. First one I have seen in weeks since I started looking for it.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>486323</b></h3>Just after server reset, there were two dozen of these up all around the map, mostly near the mountainous borders with the highest concentration (almost half) being in the area between Timbermaw Post and Lake Kel'Theril.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Emilith</b></h3>These guys seem to share spawn points with the other pets in the zone. I found mine just north of Frostwhisper Gorge as soon as I entered Winterspring from the south. My husband was also searching. We flew around clearing out all the battle pets (battling and abandoning or just killing) for about 10 minutes and got 2-3 to spawn. So if you can't find any, just clear out all the chipmunks and bunnies and maybe you'll get lucky. :) Happy hunting!<br /><br />- Out of 3 battled between us, one was poor quality and the other 2 were uncommon. -</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LadySuncrusher</b></h3>caught myself an uncommon lil cutie today after catching a poor and common quality, seems as if they do spawn from november to possibly march, winter time, don't worry about checking before november 1st as u won't see any, they do not spawn as quickly as other pets in the area but r not dependant on specifics to spawn either, happy hunting</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Owlette</b></h3>Just too cute &lt;3</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maricah</b></h3>I had NO luck with these guys last night. But I woke up early this morning to catch Restless Shadelings and checked out the Snowy Owls just in case. It's 8:40am EST and I found 2 so far, one rare and one uncommon. Sigh, these really are just chance creatures, I searched fer HOURS last night.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1061140</b></h3>Having the worst luck in finding a rare version of this pet. I have managed to engage over 100 now and not a single rare spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>vampirechickk</b></h3>So.. If you accidentally kill a wild pet you were looking to tame, exit the game ASAP Before the battle ends. The majority of the time, you will see it reappear after you log back in; And yes, I have tried this and it has worked! (But I tried this while a second or 3rd battle pet was still alive... so not sure if this method will work fighting against only 1 wild pet. Maybe.. if you X out of wow soon enough)<br /><br />:::EDIT::: Looks like Blizzard no longer allows this. It doesn't seem to work anymore. /sadface</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1064376</b></h3>I don't know if it will help any of the rare pet farmers like myself or not, but I picked up a rare in the same location twice at approximately 52 31 at about 5:15pm server time both days. I'd like someone to verify if that ever comes true again or if just a complete coincidence.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shashos</b></h3>While searching for a rare of this birdy, or at least an uncommon, I was engaging and then logging out if it was a common or poor quality so someone else could have it for the achievement. What I noticed was that the owl was -not- there when I logged back in. Clicking around with my macro did not show the pet to be anywhere around the area either. (The little guys were scattered all over the zone. I made notes on my map to show where I'd found them and flew around to each place. No more owls at those spots, though I did notice that owls had spawned in different areas where they hadn't been prior to that point.)<br /><br />This goes against all previous behavior of the pet battle system that I've encountered. I don't know if it was latency, an effect of CRZ, a bug, or a stealth change by Blizzard to stop us from logging out and respawning the mobs.<br /><br />This may have just been a fluke. I'll have to test this on other mobs in other zones.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1043431</b></h3>Well, I tried farming this STUPID snowy Owl on my level 90 LOREMASTER thats &quot;done it all&quot;, no dice, could see them flying in and out on Taxi's but NEVER in person, I even came here on other toons that have NEVER been to Winterspring thinking it was something to do with quests or rep..... NO DICE<br /><br />But then I took the advise of the smartest Player in our guild, and made a brand new level 1 nobody, and took a boat and a taxi to Moonglade, and a friend with a 2 seater mount took me around on the back......<br /><br />SNOWY OWLS GALORE! found 6, a poor, 4 commons and a Uncommon<br /><br />I just kept clicking on the mini map and making pings for my friend to see so I could &quot;guide them&quot; around !<br /><br />(side note: friend that drove me around DOESNT have Pet Battles, never paid the 25G to activate it)<br />Don't know if that part matters, hope this helps someone!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Neevee</b></h3>I play on an Oceanic server so wasn't sure whether or not these would spawn in the Northern or Southern Hemisphere winter, especially as I'd spend a lot of time in Winterspring without seeing one. I found one today so it looks like Blizzard don't change the spawns based on the seasons where you are - they just follow Northern Hemisphere seasons.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kevinwakham</b></h3>so excited...been looking off and on for 2 days. thanks to the posts above. I found 2 a common behind frostsaber rock accompanied with a rare robo chick. 3:54 pm server time. 45.4 / 14.7. the next one was in the area of the quest to kill the flying owls and bears and the daily quest for your cub for him to pounce on the bunny mounds. forgot to log coords sorry.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>912650</b></h3>I just found two today, <b>19-Jan-2013</b>, in Aerie Peak-US. The weird thing about these seasonal pets is that there are realms all over the world, so technically you could catch a <a href="/npc=7554/snowy-owl">Snowy Owl</a> in Aerie Peak-USA (<b>Winter</b>) and a <a href="/npc=62526/qiraji-guardling">Qiraji Guardling</a> in Azralon-Brazil (<b>Summer</b>), in the same day, since Brazil has the opposite seasons to the USA. I did not test this, but if Blizzard wants to be logic and consistent with their realms and localizations, that is what it should happens.<br />Also, I recommend installing PetTracker add on, it will show you the location of all pets in a zone, very helpful.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Djehuty</b></h3>Whoot! Just got my rare <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=7554">Snowy Owl</a>... What I did was simply circling around Winterspring (in air). I met 8 <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=7554">Snowy Owl</a>s and the last was ofc the rare one... It took around 15 mins., that could be luck, idk, but now I don't have to look for it anymore... GL to all u guys wanting this pet in rare :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Grimmhilda</b></h3>I was lucky enough to have a flawless flying stone from the goodie bag from my trainer battle against Cassandra Kaboom, so I just captured the first snowy owl I found, even though it was poor quality, and I upgraded it using the stone. The stones are definitely a viable option.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1012488</b></h3>True story:<br />Iwannabeer's alt is continuing his long grind to find a Frostsaber Tunic pattern...<br />&quot;Honey! Are you on?&quot; he calls to the wife.<br />&quot;No. Why?&quot;<br />&quot;There's a snowy owl right here! It's only level seventeen, come catch it!&quot; There is a long pause, Beer hears the wife working on the bathroom rennovations.<br />&quot;I can't right now,&quot; she replies, &quot;And I don't have anything leveled enough to do it... I think...&quot; The beautiful bird flits around in front of Beer's alt, waiting to see what he'll do.<br />&quot;It's right here on this hilltop overlooking Everlook, hurry!&quot; <i>another player could see it any moment now...</i><br />&quot;Sorry. Can't.&quot; another pause, &quot;You can get on my account and try if you want.&quot; Beer glares daggers at the taunting owl. No time to ride to the Everlook inn to log out properly, he logs right there on the hilltop.<br /><i>30 seconds until logoff</i> Good. Run down the hallway. Into the study. Grab the wife's Authenticator hanging on the thumbtack next to her desk. Run back to the living room computer. User name-password-authenticator code... <i>hurry up you stupid machine</i> Click on her main...&quot;Crap!&quot; She's in the Temple of Two Moons! <i>please don't let anyone else see it yet!</i>. Portal to Org, the load screen drags by, every second feeling like minutes. Fly to the Mount Hyjal portal...<i>loading...</i> jump on the FP from Hyjal to Everlook. While in flight Beer sorts through her pets - the wife was right: two level seventeen Arcane Eyes and a level fifteen Restless Shadeling are the best she has. <i>This is gonna get ugly.</i> The main lands at Everlook, another pause to find the flying mount icon on her screen...<i>how the hell does she play with her action bars set this way?</i> Zoom over to the hilltop east of Everlook...<i>please still be there!</i> Yes! Thank the gaming gods, it's still flapping around without a care in the world. &quot;Oh crap! Another player!&quot; <br />Beer dive-bombs straight at the owl as the other player's blip on the map suddenly changes direction straight at the owl. The Cenarion Hippogriff slams down on top of the birdy and Beer right-clicks it: the battle has begun!<br />&quot;Oh-my-god!&quot; the Snowy Owl's nameplate shines a beautiful royal blue. &quot;Honey! It's a Rare!&quot; Beer can barely control his trembling, the stakes have just gotten MUCH higher! The wife's Arcane Eye opens with a blast and barely scratches the owl. The bird responds by knocking 20% off the Eyes health with a single blow. The pets trade hits back and forth as Beer struggles to get the Owl's health low enough to throw the trap. <i>Almost there...</i> The Eye falls to the snow - defeated. The second eye moves up, scores a hit and the Trap icon glows. Beer throws it - missed! &quot;Crap!&quot; The Owl responds to the insult by summoning a Cyclone - the last Eye and the Restless Shadeling are about to get chewed to pieces. The Eye hits the Owl feebly once more to get the trap to stick, <i>Throw it! Throw it!</i> &quot;Yes!&quot; the trap snaps down on the prize. Now to deal with the adds: a Rabid Nut Varmint 5000 and an Alpine Hare. Beer swallows hard, yes, this IS getting ugly! The Eye holds it own for a while against the mech - even killing it, but gets killed itself when the RNV5000 rezzes. The Restless Shadeling glides up and finishes the mech for good, now for the Hare. Beer's pulse races as the Shadeling and Hare trade blows and the Shadeling's health dwindles, &quot;C'mon dammit! Hit harder!&quot;<br />So how does the story end? Did Iwannabeer log off in the wilderness, log into the love-of-his-life's account, port and fly across two continents only to have her three highest level pets go down in shameful defeat? Or did he narrowly snatch a glorious victory from the blood-stained snow with a Rare-quality, very-hard-to-find and beautiful battle pet as a gift for his beloved? Beer smiles, &quot; I ain't saying...&quot; :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1090536</b></h3>At my realm : Darksorrow Eu the pet spawn alot , got a rare today.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1091532</b></h3>Its February 15th, 2013, and I just caught one, time now - 4:34 pm server time. I had found one and accidently killed it, :( then I found another one and was determined to get it! so I saw two at this time in wintersprin near the other owls. (found one with the winterspring screecher and the other by the winterspring owls) good luck and happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Alyria</b></h3>Time is 9.20 server time, date is March 1st. I've flown all over Winterspring looking for the Snowy Owl and found none. Did another quick search at 10.00, nothing.<br /><br />Has Blizzard gone to summertime like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter" rel="nofollow">meteorological winter</a>? Or do we have another 10 days as with the <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/time/dst/2013.html" rel="nofollow">daylight savings</a> (if we for some odd reason should follow the Californian/Blizzard HQ's summer time which ofc Europe doesn't)? Perhaps 20 days as I've seen <a href="http://www.warcraftpets.com/wow-pets/flying/owls/snowy-owl/#page4">posts </a>saying just that? Or to return to the daylight time we might just have another months as we do play eu servers.... Cause I admit I have no idea. <br /><br />However, I'd say my search this morning was exhaustive, but I could have hit an odd hour although I consider the morning to be a rather good time to find rare pets.<br /><br />Prove me wrong, as I'd still like to find the rare version. Out of panic and not knowing when the spawns would end I finally got 3 pets to 17 yesterday at 23.00 and rushed to Winterspring to find an owl - poor quality sadfully. :( I trapped it still as I was too tired for anything else at that time, just wanted it to be over with.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1100832</b></h3>It seems the last day of Winter in WoW is the last day of February.<br />As soon as I looked at the spawn conditions of this wild pet I quickly leveled 3 magic pets to 15 or so. That done I stormed to Winterspring just do discover that I was 1 day late.<br />It is March 1st morning and there's no trace of Snowy Owl in Winterspring T_T<br /><br />Edit: I just read Alyria's post. I reached Winterspring after 10:00 AM server time. So I can't confirm there were some Snowy Owl around before that time, but I can confirm I didn't found any past that time.</div>

There are quite a few conflicting answers at this time ^^;<br /><br />So Winter in Azeroth DOES end on March 20th. However, the Snowy Owl pet in Winterspring stops spawning before then. <br /><br />Now that we have established how it is currently working, the crux of the matter is whether the Snowy Owl availability is working as intended or not. That, to be honest, is something that will have to be clarified by our developers as many players have been asking this of us. I've gone ahead and added your character information as well as petition data to a report to send to our quality assurance team and developers.&quot;<br /><br />Even the GMs don't know how this pet works.</div>

It's 9:00 pm and still no sign of owls. My Blossoming Ancient is still in its fall glory of colors. Does that mean it's not really winter in Azeroth yet? Sources all say November 1st is start of Azerothian winter. (correction, sources say winter starts in Sept but also say Snowy Owls don't spawn till Nov. 1st.) Have they all been farmed out? Doesn't seem likely though there were two others looking this morning. And, they don't appear to be particularly sparce from comments others have made. Is this just behind schedule a bit? My server only? Stay tuned to find out.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>carens</b></h3><b>FOR 2013</b>: I'm thinking we will not see the Snowy Owls until December 21. Here's my reasoning:<br /><br />1) I was in Winterspring at 12:05 am on Nov. 1, and not a single Snowy Owl in sight. Camped off and on for several hours - nada. Came back immediately after a server restart - still nothing.<br /><br />2) I did some research on the forums - the blue posts were all extremely vague about 'winter' for Azeroth, although it does appear 'winter' follows the Northern Hemisphere seasons.<br /><br />3) And this I believe is the clue: <u><b>The Qiraji Guardling is considered a 'summer' pet. This year it did not begin to spawn until June 21</b></u> - the official beginning of summer in the Northern Hemisphere.<br /><br />So I'm gonna quit camping Winterspring for now (although I may check from time to time), but I WILL be there at 12:05 am on December 21!<br /><br /><b>EDIT: See Bassboater69's response from a GM - these will start to spawn DECEMBER 21!</b></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>eurolink</b></h3>Okay, we have numerous comments on people getting their Snowy Owl; we know it's made its appearance. It happens on December 21st, the first day of winter, and lasts throughout winter. Could we please focus the comments on the specifics of catching one? Honestly, times and servers play no part in this so these comments are just unnecessary clutter.<br /><br />What I'd like to know is:<br /><br /><ol><li>Can the Snowy Owl appear as a back-line pet?</li><li>Does the Snowy Owl spawn in the place of other battle pets. In other words: would killing existing battle pets in the zone help in getting the Snowy Owl to spawn?</li></ol><br /><br />Update: I finally was able to find a Snowy Owl (S/B poor quality) at (58.20, 89.03) in the Frostwhisper Gorge area. It seemed counter-productive flying around endlessly in circles hunting them down. You end up flying past a spawn point and missing one appear just 30 seconds after you passed by. I stayed in the general area and killed any pet I found (after checking for the possibility of a back-line pet) and just waited. It took about 15 mins before this one appeared.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vomitory</b></h3>12/29/2013 1:10pm EST (On Rexxar), The Hidden Grove had two of these spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Drizzintahl</b></h3>I just found 3 of these in 20 minutes. I hear they're extremely rare still, but I just got super lucky. A green and a grey, and I stuck around and held the 3rd for someone in channel. I guess tonight is my night? Lol.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Heimdallen</b></h3>I didn't know if this would show up a secondary pet, so for quite a while (about 90 minutes or so) I kept engaging rabbits and chipmunks and squirrels in the area of Mazthoril. Finally I decided that they apparently must not spawn as secondaries, as none showed up after trying about 30 or 40 times. So I started just killing anything and everything that was a battle pet and not a Snowy Owl battle pet in the whole area of Mazthoril. <br /><br />After slaughtering about 45 battle pets (NOT by fighting them, that takes too long, by just killing them straight up) I came back around to where I initially started my killing, and sure enough, a Snowy Owl had spawned! Very first one I saw, and I engaged it, and it was a rare, Power/Balance. Came with a Mountain Skunk and an Alpine Hare, I believe. I was delighted. <br /><br />So my advice is to just kill off every critter in the Mazthoril area that's not a Snowy Owl, as I can't say for sure if the Owl can and will spawn as a secondary pet, but if it does, the odds of it happening are really low. You're better off clearing the critters until a Snowy Owl spawns. <br /><br />90 minutes of battling pets to see if a Snowy Owl was there as a secondary, and when it wasn't finishing the battle anyway for XP for my pets, vs. 10 minutes of killing everything and then following the same circular path I took killing them all and a Snowy Owl had popped up in place of a rabbit or something that was there before. Much better and more time efficient to do it this way. <br /><br />And as far as me being super lucky and getting a rare on my first one; a) No matter what it was I was going to use one of my dozen flying battle stones to upgrade it if it wasn't already blue anyway, and b) I've had my super sized share of bad luck farming pets, such as spending literally 12 hours grinding out mobs in Feralas at 10 mobs a minute trying to get the Sprite Darter Hatchling. I ended up with over 2,000 silk cloth, like 7 blues, 100 greens, and a serious headache before I gave up and bought the damn thing off the AH. So don't envy my luck with the owl, hahaha, I've had plenty of terrible luck elsewhere :P<br /><br />Happy Hunting!<br /><br />P.S. - I later found a few Snowy Owls near the entrance into Winterspring, on the far West side, you know, where the Furbolg tunnel comes out, Timbermaw Hold. There were a few in that area between the tunnel exit and Donova Snowden and the Frostfire Hotsprings, like if you drew a triangle between those 3 points, there were several owls inside that area. <br /><br />P.P.S. - I was initially searching around Mazthoril due to the many comments suggesting that area. However, I later found 4 or 5 Snowy Owls in the Northern wing of the map, like north of Starfall Village all the way up to Frostsaber Rock, on both sides of the road. And I'm on a very high pop server, Tichondrius. So it might be worth forgetting about Mazthoril initially and looking in these two other places I found Snowy Owls up and about; this one and the one I mentioned in the first P.S.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Valkeyrie</b></h3>Competition has been pretty tough for the snowy owl. After hours and hours of searching I ended up making a DK on a low pop Brazillian server. I ended up choosing Tol Barad. I leveled my DK to 60, sold a couple pets to afford flying and then flew to Winterspring. Took about 10 minutes to find once I arrived. <br /><br />Hope this helps someone get their pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>aspasito</b></h3>if on your server they're being camped (or you've just checked every single one of them and still no rares), there is always the cross realm option. while listing yourself for flex and waiting for ages for a tank to join the group, go to that realms winterspring, and check their owls. Beats bunny-hopping in Timeless Isle, imho.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sailoranchored93</b></h3>I spent about 2 hours trying to find my Snowy Owl. After watching some Ally kill all of them(that weren't rare I assume), I kept circling the whole zone. I also went to Everlook to get one of the Anodized Robo Cubs, but sure enough, there was that Druid, killing them all. Anyways, after having my heart ripped out by this guy for the second time, I decided to go Mazthoril because most of the comments say the owls spawn the most there. I finally found my little guy! He was poor quality but at that point I didn't care. After the battle was finished I had a change of luck and received a Flawless Battle-Stone! (: I usually sell them on the AH, but I have wanted one of these owls for awhile now, so I decided to treat myself. So believe me, you will find one! It just takes a little bit of time. Happy Hunting and may you have better luck than me. (:</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Inumaru</b></h3>For those saying that Winter ends Feb 28th, I just want to say that I'm currently (at time of posting, March 6 ) in Winterspring and have just found a Snowy Owl.<br /><br />So, for anyone trying to capture these rare pets, they are apparently still available for a little bit longer.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>copperboom</b></h3>They are still available as of March 09 2014. Hurry and get them if you don't want to wait a year! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mekikya</b></h3>Everyone has the dates wrong for some reason? Like the Summer Bass and the Winter Squid, the change happens on the summer and winter equinox. September 22nd-March 20th is when the snowy owl is supposed to be available, but Blizz goofed, patched it in late past year(2013), proof is in the pudding, still hunting my rare on March 19th 2014. Lots of grays and commons, no rare yet...<br /><br />FINALLY, caught my rare snowy owl, on March 20th, 2014</div>

Thanks for contacting us today. I've reviewed your issue about the Snowy Owl and I have news.<br /><br />The Snowy Owl pet is available during the winter season in-game wich normally runs from September 20th~ to March 20th~ of the following year. Most of the time these dates are in-tune with the atumnal equinox or beginning of Autumn and the vernal equinox or beginning of spring.<br /><br />These dates are subject to change, though. Any updates to the changes in the winter or summer seasons in-game will be posted in a blog on the World of Warcraft website.<br /><br />May all your hits be crits and all your loot epic! <br /><br />Game Master Tiltowick<br />Customer Support<br />battle.net/support</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tequilaloverz</b></h3>I got confirmation by a GM today on 21/09/2014 that this pet will only spawn from 21st December to 21st March(Official Winter Time for Blizzard according to the GM they changed it to collaborate with the real winter time.) So if you are out looking for this pet, you won't find it until 21st December.</div>

I found one at 13:10 pm (midday not early morning or night; i always work with a 24 clock so...not used to pm and am). <br /><br />I am delighted that I finally caught one :)<br /><br />Happy Hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1344999</b></h3>Today was the second day of spawning (12/22/2014) of the Snowy Owl, so I figured I'd go try to catch one, as it is one of two pets i still need for the World Safari achievement, the other being the Quiraji Guardling. I searched for about 30 min and finally stumbled upon one just SW of Starfall Village. I entered combat and caught it rather quickly. Most of you would assume this is where my story ends, but sadly it is not. As I was about to land the final blow to the 3rd pet, I was trolled on a level I have never been trolled before, when a 93 hunter hit me and ended my pet battle. Because I am 100, he was clearly just trolling me and he quickly used his glider to escape combat... I caught up to him only to be /loled at mercilessly. I am only withholding his character name because I want this post to get upvoted. I want to petition Blizzard to make players unattackable while in a pet battle. This has ALWAYS been a tremendous inconvenience, and it is in no way fair- even for the sake of fairly matched pvp because you can get torn up before you even fully exit the pet battle screen. Most importantly, however, it seems to be a mechanic that exists for the sole purpose of letting players troll one another out of rare pets, which I cannot stand. My story ends here, hours later, owl-less and still searching. Upvote this if this has happened to you, or you would like to see this mechanic removed from the game.<br /><br />EDIT: Finally caught one just south of the &quot;O&quot; in Mazthroil. From my 2 hours worth of searching, I have deducted a few tips that may help...<br />1. They truly DO spawn ANYWHERE in Winterspring<br />2. I have never seen more than 1 up at a time<br />3. The respawn seems to be between 30min-1hour<br />4. (The obvious) They only spawn from Dec. 21-Mar. 20</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kamalia</b></h3>Got up before server restart this morning. Found an Uncommon Snowy Owl, started the pet battle. Someone on my own side brought an NPC to me and killed it on top of me, effectively stopping my pet battle as I was about to catch this. Needless to say I got really mad. Server restart was coming, found another Snowy Owl, alliance had it - since I was mad I killed him. <br /><br />Server restart came and went - logged back in and there were Snowy Owls everywhere. So my advice is this - keep an alt camped there or just park yourself there wait for server restart log in and boom catch one. I caught a Poor quality one then noticed they were all over the place battled a few more to try for rare and then stumbled upon another Uncommon quality. <br /><br />Hope this helps. Now to wait for &quot;Summer&quot; and I'll finally be a Zookeeper. Happy Hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1048480</b></h3>Caught one at 58, 21--thought it worth mentioning because it is one of those spots where four or five pets spawn very near to one another. If you're into camping and battling until one pops, consider this spot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Spycrab</b></h3>Winterspring was being pretty heavily pet farmed on my high pop server when I took a friend with me to go get our Snowy Owls. I found an uncommon one south of Frostwhisper Gorge around the bears and the Frostmaul Preservers with several chipmunks and a rabbit, and, after no luck finding for her, I came back and started killing critters and the other pets in that area and got one to spawn for her in less than five minutes. Hers was poor quality, but we were just happy to get one each, with how many people there were! Nobody seemed to be coming down that far to that are, either. Might be a nice place to set up shop and try out if you're having bad luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dillybar</b></h3>Hunters: If the area is overloaded with Alpine (squirrel/rabbits), you don't have to battle them to remove them, you can actually kill battle pets using both fire trap, and if you catch them while barraging another NPC (imagine that, barrage hitting something unexpectedly, THAT never happens). The significance of this? I ran around for about 2 hours looking for a Snowy Owl, then read on here that if you kill all the critters, one has a much higher chance of spawning. <br /><br /> Well, I killed critters AND killed the battle pets using my trap and barrage, I killed everything, even the Shardtooth Bears and humanoid creatures, for ten minutes along the road to Timbermaw Hold, and sure enough, right quick, a Snowy Owl showed up. <br /><br />So removing critters/battle pets from the area can in fact spawn a Snowy Owl a LOT quicker, as was stated in other comments.</div>
