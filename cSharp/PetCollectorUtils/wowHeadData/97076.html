<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Feliciamarie</b></h3>Using brithawk's coordinates, I went around the entire mountain and killed any battle pet or npc critter that wasn't a Fledgling Kingfeather. Kill them so one can spawn in it's place. Took me about an hour but I had zero competition.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Treekachu</b></h3>I believe these may have a timer for how long they are present. While trying to get to one (as some fly quite a distance overhead), it despawned and was replaced by an Oliveback without any interaction on my part.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ladynagini</b></h3>I've been killing fledling olivebacks for about an hour now, and twice i moused over paws to have them come up 'fledgling kingfeather' only for it to change into an olive back when i moved over.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aliandrin</b></h3>For those without coordinates:<br /><br />Start at Illadari stand and run Northwest along the road until you hit an area with banshees in it. To your right, you will see a path that heads up. Keep climbing and you will climb to the top of the tallest mountain in Azsuna. Along the way, you will find <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62818/grizzly-squirrel">Grizzly Squirrel</a>s, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=97294/olivetail-hare">Olivetail Hare</a>s, Fledgling Olivebacks, and if you're incredibly lucky, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=97076/fledgling-kingfeather">Fledgling Kingfeather</a>s.<br /><br />When you get to the top, there will be a chest and some elite demons. On the other side, there will be a single spawn point that can make either an Olivetail Hare or a Grizzly Squirrel. DO NOT JUMP DOWN TO GET IT. You will not be able to come back to the correct side of the mountain to obtain Fledglings.<br /><br />Fledglings spawn only here and cannot be secondaries, despite the fact that crabs and snails can be secondaries and are thus appearing atop the highest mountain in Azsuna alongside Fledglings.<br /><br />Make special note of the fact that each spawn point can be filled with a critter Fledgling, and prevent a catchable Fledgling from spawning there. You must kill the critter even if it's only a brown one. Normally I would tell you to let the Oliveback critters live because it discourages any pokemon that spawn from being Olivebacks (and would thus eventually force a Kingfeather) but there are so few of these spawns that you must simply free them up. Fledgling spawn points are out on the rocks that border the path around the mountain and you must check every rock to see if a critter fledgling is there, and if it is, slay it immediately.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TheGrandmaGamer</b></h3>Did you ever wonder how you could be so lucky as to hop right in to a server just in time to see and battle a Fledgling Kingfeather? It is because someone that belongs on that server just spent maybe hours clearing out the critters so that one would spawn; for them, not for you.<br /><br />Congratulations. You not only joined a group in order to get on their server so you basically left them hanging. You also stole someone else's time and patience killing critters so that they could get the Safari Achievement.<br /><br />I know. It happened to me.<br /><br />Don't feel proud of doing that.<br /><br />Go ahead and down-vote this all you want. After hours of farming I walked back to a spawn point to see someone from another server and there was nothing I could do about it so I have the right to point it out.<br /><br />I guess so far there are 7 realm hoppers out there that this post made uncomfortable. GOOD! At least you care. If you didn't, you wouldn't take the time to down vote. Next time, think about what you are doing before you do it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TheGrandmaGamer</b></h3>I decided to quit worrying about all the other critters and battle pets in the area and just concentrate on the Fledglings. There are four areas up there that the Oliveback consistently spawns, and 2 of them are marked on the WowHead map above as points where others have caught a Kingfeather. <br /><br />I started at the top near the tower at /way 44.2 23.4 and I waited for the Oliveback to spawn there. I killed it and headed down to the other spawn point. The other 2 spawns are along the ridge you pass to take the path down to the 2nd point. I killed those if I saw them but I don't think they are as important as I thought they were. I waited at 38.4 24.2 until that one spawned, killed it and headed back up to the tower spawn point. <br /><br />I no longer worried about killing any other critter or battle pet and I felt better about not spending all my time trying to clear the entire area and just concentrating on the spawn points. I don't know how long the Kingfeather stays up when it spawns so I don't know how often I may have missed it, not only from de-spawning but from Realm hopper getting it.<br /><br />On my 6th trip up to the tower spawn point the Kingfeather was there, flying around with a beautiful green paw over his head. My capture pet battle team consists of two Terrible Turnips using Weakening Blow, Inspiring Song, and Sunlight to increase the health of my team and a third assassin pet to kill the other 2 pets, so I am never afraid I will kill the pet I am after. <br /><br />It may have been pure luck, it may have been keeping better tabs on what actually spawns; IDK. All I know is I got one and I am SO happy. If this helps another collector, GOOD! Good Luck to all !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sunreaver</b></h3>I see a lot of comments about finding the Fledgling Kingfeathers, but none about the battles themselves. Yes, you have to pet battle the birds (not just kill them), and yes you have to have your hatchling on the team... which means you only have two other slots to build your team with. The Kingfeathers are in the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=239/flying">Flying</a> family, but they're usually backed up by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=237/beast">Beasts</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=236/critter">Critters</a> - with the occasional <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=240/aquatic">Aquatic</a> thrown in for good measure. That said, I was able to solo the fights with just my Anubisath Idol. <br /><br />Pet 1: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=68659/anubisath-idol">Anubisath Idol</a><br />Pet 2: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=48609/clockwork-gnome">Clockwork Gnome</a><br />Pet 3: <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=115787/bloodgazer-hatchling">Bloodgazer Hatchling</a><br /><br />With the Anubisath Idol, cast a Sandstorm, throw up Deflection, then keep those up while you Crush.<br /><br />Since there's no telling what kind of mix you'll get, just fill the second slot with whatever Mechanical, Beast, or Critter pet you prefer. I chose a Mechanical because of the Repair ability and the family passive rez.</div>
