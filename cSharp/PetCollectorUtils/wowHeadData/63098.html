not a minute stopped or stayed he,\r\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--\r\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--\r\n                     Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nThen the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\r\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\r\n\"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no craven,\r\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--\r\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"\r\n                     Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nMuch I marveled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\r\nThough its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;\r\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\r\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--\r\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\r\n                     With such name as \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only\r\nThat one word, as if its soul in that one word he did outpour\r\nNothing farther then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered--\r\nTill I scarcely more than muttered: \"Other friends have flown before--\r\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.\"\r\n                     Then the bird said \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\r\n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,\r\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\r\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--\r\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\r\n                     Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"\r\n\r\nBut the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,\r\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;\r\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\r\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--\r\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\r\n                     Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\r\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;\r\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\r\nOn the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,\r\nBut whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er\r\n                     She shall press, ah, nevermore!\r\n\r\nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\r\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\r\n\"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee\r\nRespite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!\r\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!\"\r\n                     Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--\r\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\r\nDesolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--\r\nOn this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--\r\nIs there--is there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\"\r\n                     Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!\r\nBy that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--\r\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\r\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--\r\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"\r\n                     Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be that our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked, upstarting--\r\n\"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!\r\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken!\r\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!\r\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"\r\n                     Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\r\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\r\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming\r\nAnd the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadows on the floor;\r\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\r\n                     Shall be lifted--nevermore!","date":"2012-10-07T19:09:24-05:00","rating":5,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Edgar Allan Poe.

You have to go through the entire DK quest chain (that ends in Stormwind); don't try to take shortcuts, it will only slow you down.  Take all quests that are offered to you and complete them.  You have to murder yourself through the entire quest chain...\r\n\r\n2. Remember that Worgens have natural riding capability, and since you start with your riding skill trained (as a DK), you can use it right away.  This will make the first few quests until you acquire your DK mount a bit easier.\r\n\r\n3. If you have DPS plate heirlooms, you can use them, but you get nice blue gear really fast during the quest chain, so it doesn't matter much.  Don't go out of your way acquiring heirloom gear just for this endeavour.\r\n\r\n4. If you have to \"kill X of a kind\" for a quest, it's advised to pull multiple mobs, apply your diseases to one of them, and then use Blood Boil (which spreads the diseases to the entire pack).  Finish off with Death Strike.\r\n\r\n5. At some point in the quest chain you have to \"interrogate\" Scarlet Crusaders by hitting them with quest supplied weapons.  This is RNG based and might take a while.  Don't forget to get the accompanying quest that asks you to kill a lot of Scarlet Crusaders while you do it.\r\n\r\n6. Don't rush through the quest chain if you've never played a Death Knight.  It's actually a quite entertaining story.  Especially the end.\r\n\r\n7. I guess you don't have to do the final quest in the chain (hand the letter to King Wrynn).  You are phased in SW and people throw rotten tomatoes at you, but if you go, e.g. to Ironforge or Dun Morough, the folks there don't seem to have received the Death Knight Memo as it seems, and everybody will do business as usual with you.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Immoovable</b></h3>At least at the moment, this is only available by creating a Worgen character and then training it at the pet battle trainers. Pets are shared account-wide, however, and (at least at the moment) there is no requirement to keep the character that acquired the pet. So, as long as you have a free character slot available, you may make the Worgen, buy the pet, and then delete the Worgen while retaining the pet. Several other trainer pets (but not all of them) are exclusive in this manner.<br /><br />Despite some earlier comments to the contrary, the trainer in Stormwind will have this available for Worgen. Specifically visiting the Darkshore trainer is not required. Note that this does require you to complete the Worgen introductory scenario.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aquifel</b></h3>This pet is available via the battle pet trainer (currently any battle pet trainer can be used, but previously each pet was only available to the specific battle pet trainer for your race) depending on your race.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Praxidice</b></h3>After reading the comments here I was worried I wouldn't be able to get this pet as I have already learned pet training and proceeded pretty far with it on my Pandaren. Happily, I hopped on my Worgen druid, flew to Lor'danel and lo and behold, there was the raven. 40 silver.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>457933</b></h3>If you can, roll a Worgen DK rather than going through the entire baby worgen zone (Gilneas). MUCH easier and faster to get through the mandatory quests as you level (55-58 vs 1-13) and your last DK quest takes you straight to SW anyway, where the pet trainer with the raven is.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Obelisk96</b></h3>I know this is obviously a reference to &quot;The Raven&quot; by Edgar Allen Poe, especially since it has an ability called Nevermore, but could it also serve a duel reference towards Itachi Uchiha from the Naruto anime/manga? Itachi does use ravens/crows for his genjutsu which alone is not a good reason for it to reference him, but the Gilnean Raven's level 2 ability called &quot;Darkflame&quot; keeps reminding me of Itachi's Amaterasu.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1042192</b></h3>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br />Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore--<br />While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br />As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br />&quot;'Tis some visitor,&quot; I muttered, &quot;tapping at my chamber door--<br /> Only this and nothing more.&quot;<br /><br />Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<br />And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br />Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow<br />From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--<br />For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--<br /> Nameless here for evermore.<br /><br />And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br />Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br />So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br />&quot;'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--<br />Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;<br /> This it is and nothing more.&quot;<br /><br />Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br />&quot;Sir,&quot; said I, &quot;or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br />But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br />And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br />That I scarce was sure I heard you&quot;--here I opened wide the door--<br /> Darkness there and nothing more.<br /><br />Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br />Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;<br />But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br />And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, &quot;Lenore?&quot;<br />This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, &quot;Lenore!&quot;--<br /> Merely this and nothing more.<br /><br />Back into the chamber turning, all my sour within me burning,<br />Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.<br />&quot;Surely,&quot; said I, &quot;surely that is something at my window lattice;<br />Let me see, then, what thereat is and this mystery explore--<br />Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--<br /> 'Tis the wind and nothing more.<br /><br />Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br />In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.<br />Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he,<br />But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--<br />Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--<br /> Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br /><br />Then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br />By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br />&quot;Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,&quot; I said, &quot;art sure no craven,<br />Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--<br />Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!&quot;<br /> Quoth the Raven, &quot;Nevermore.&quot;<br /><br />Much I marveled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br />Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;<br />For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br />Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--<br />Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br /> With such name as &quot;Nevermore.&quot;<br /><br />But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only<br />That one word, as if its soul in that one word he did outpour<br />Nothing farther then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered--<br />Till I scarcely more than muttered: &quot;Other friends have flown before--<br />On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.&quot;<br /> Then the bird said &quot;Nevermore.&quot;<br /><br />Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br />&quot;Doubtless,&quot; said I, &quot;what it utters is its only stock and store,<br />Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br />Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--<br />Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br /> Of 'Never--nevermore.'&quot;<br /><br />But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,<br />Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;<br />Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br />Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--<br />What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br /> Meant in croaking &quot;Nevermore.&quot;<br /><br />This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br />To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;<br />This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br />On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,<br />But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er<br /> She shall press, ah, nevermore!<br /><br />Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br />Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br />&quot;Wretch,&quot; I cried, &quot;thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee<br />Respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!<br />Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!&quot;<br /> Quoth the Raven, &quot;Nevermore.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Prophet!&quot; said I, &quot;thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--<br />Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br />Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--<br />On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--<br />Is there--is there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!&quot;<br /> Quoth the Raven, &quot;Nevermore.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Prophet!&quot; said I, &quot;thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!<br />By that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--<br />Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br />It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--<br />Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.&quot;<br /> Quoth the Raven, &quot;Nevermore.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Be that our sign of parting, bird or fiend!&quot; I shrieked, upstarting--<br />&quot;Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!<br />Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken!<br />Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!<br />Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!&quot;<br /> Quoth the Raven, &quot;Nevermore.&quot;<br /><br />And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br />On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br />And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming<br />And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadows on the floor;<br />And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br /> Shall be lifted--nevermore!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>timmune</b></h3>For the Horde: if your considering rolling a Worgen DK to acquire the raven but would like to know what that entails:<br /><br />You have to to complete the starting quests for DK, which is roughly all the quests you encounter up to lvl 58. Around 58 you should get a quest from LK to use the portal to Stormwind (in Ebon Hold) and speak to the King of Stormwind. Once you speak to the King, you can then walk around the block and speak to the pet trainer and learn Gilnean Raven.<br /><br />For me, from start to finish the process took roughly 2 hours. I imagine that's probably a decent guess for the average player.<br /><br />That said, in my experience at least, you're looking at about 3 hours of grind time to acquire this pet and lvl it to 25 using the method described.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1195962</b></h3>This pet hits like a TRUCK against aquatics! <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=256">Call Darkness</a> reduces their healing, which makes aquatics less annoying to battle, and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=517">Nocturnal Strike</a> has a 100% hit chance when the weather is Darkness, crushing your opponents with a mega hit! One of my favorite pets - he's totally worth making a Worgen for!<br /><br />Also, if you are a hunter looking for a hunter pet to match, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=65629">Upland Raven</a> in Kun-Lai matches perfectly.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>siggboy</b></h3>If you roll a Worgen Death Knight in order to buy this pet, here are a few hints:<br /><br />1. You have to go through the entire DK quest chain (that ends in Stormwind); don't try to take shortcuts, it will only slow you down. Take all quests that are offered to you and complete them. You have to murder yourself through the entire quest chain...<br /><br />2. Remember that Worgens have natural riding capability, and since you start with your riding skill trained (as a DK), you can use it right away. This will make the first few quests until you acquire your DK mount a bit easier.<br /><br />3. If you have DPS plate heirlooms, you can use them, but you get nice blue gear really fast during the quest chain, so it doesn't matter much. Don't go out of your way acquiring heirloom gear just for this endeavour.<br /><br />4. If you have to &quot;kill X of a kind&quot; for a quest, it's advised to pull multiple mobs, apply your diseases to one of them, and then use Blood Boil (which spreads the diseases to the entire pack). Finish off with Death Strike.<br /><br />5. At some point in the quest chain you have to &quot;interrogate&quot; Scarlet Crusaders by hitting them with quest supplied weapons. This is RNG based and might take a while. Don't forget to get the accompanying quest that asks you to kill a lot of Scarlet Crusaders while you do it.<br /><br />6. Don't rush through the quest chain if you've never played a Death Knight. It's actually a quite entertaining story. Especially the end.<br /><br />7. I guess you don't have to do the final quest in the chain (hand the letter to King Wrynn). You are phased in SW and people throw rotten tomatoes at you, but if you go, e.g. to Ironforge or Dun Morough, the folks there don't seem to have received the Death Knight Memo as it seems, and everybody will do business as usual with you. So you can train your Raven there. Or just hand in the letter and get it over with...</div>
