<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>vanitdi</b></h3>This morning, about 4am server, I saw four iguanas in Twilight withering and four in Twilight Bulwark. Only a couple of scorpids no other pet mobs in those immediate areas. Six were poor and two uncommon. No one else around.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>flaotinging</b></h3>A bit more data:<br />Had a server restart (as in, 15 minute restart not reset) about 3 hours before I went to 1K Needles to look for these. Saw at least 6 up in the Twilight Bulwark but there were <b>none</b> at the Twilight Withering at the same time. So, make sure to check both locations even if you don't find any in one.<br /><br />(P.S. I was lucky and got a rare. Play on, playa)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ayrenn</b></h3>I found and captured one of these at Twilight Bulwark around 13:30 realm time. There were plenty nearby.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>abexy</b></h3>If you are questing in Thousand Needles and hunting this pet, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=47580">Lakota Windsong</a> gives quests which give you a disguise so the Twilight folks in the area are friendly. If you are in your early 40s it makes searching for this pet much easier.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DrCheis</b></h3>They're not very difficult to farm, even if you're trying to get a rare one. The trick is to patrol the two spawn areas and battle every pet you see, including the ones that aren't iguanas. By the time you have reached one end of the route, more will have respawned and you can circle back in the other direction.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TerribleAtGames</b></h3>I have yet to see <a href="/npc=62255/twilight-iguana">Twilight Iguana</a> as a secondary pet, so don't count on obtaining it by battling other pets in the area.</div>
