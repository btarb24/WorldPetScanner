<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>QuickBASIC</b></h3>It's worth noting that the <a href="/npc=65324/wild-golden-hatchling">Wild Golden Hatchling</a> and <a href="/npc=65323/wild-jade-hatchling">Wild Jade Hatchling</a> have identical movesets, whereas the <a href="/npc=65321/wild-crimson-hatchling">Wild Crimson Hatchling</a> has a <s>unique</s> different moveset.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>839294</b></h3>Battling these little wild hatchlings can be extremely annoying. I caught all 3, but they're of poor quality and I wanted to try and get uncommon or rare ones. I have the strong pet trap, but keep missing 3-4 times before I'm able to capture (and this goes for ALL battle pets I try to capture, not just the wild hatchlings. I mean what's the point of having the strong trap if I miss 4 times before capturing?)<br /><br />So anyways, I'm battling these little annoying things and they have this tornado ability. Not only does it damage the pet you're using, but it also damages your other battle pets that are behind you, but that's not the annoying part. The annoying part is this tornado ability takes literally a minute and a half to do it's thing before you're allowed to take your turn. So, a minute and a half each time it does damage (every turn, it's one of those abilities that goes for multiple rounds) times missing a capture 4 times equals a long as crap battle for ONE pet.<br /><br />I finally managed to get an uncommon crimson and an uncommon jade, so all I'm missing is an uncommon golden. I'm not sure I have the patience to try for 3 rare ones.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kyokushinkai</b></h3>I had been looking for these pets for several days and managed to only find 1 or 2 spawns at a time; sometimes none at all. One day it was raining and these guys were literally everywhere. They were even respawning every few minutes as I made my rounds. If you want to collect these awesome little pets, go when it rains!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>NeoAnimus</b></h3>Spent a little bit farming a rare for each color and here's the trick I found to get them. First, they are a pretty common spawn everywhere in the arboretum. Second, they share a spawn with the stupid little garden frogs there, so if they are not spawning kill the frogs. In fact if you are not seeing any then just go around killing the critters in the area and they will show up. Third, you cannot kill the dragons nor make them go away without engaging them in a pet battle, so if you are waiting for a particular color then just keep going into battle with them and then run away and the color you want will spawn soon enough. It took me an hour of doing this and I got a rare in all three colors.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aliandrin</b></h3>So here is what you do to win:<br /><br />1. <i><b>Get this pokemon.</b></i> You want him for the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/petability=204">Call Lightning</a>, so get the yellow or green one; the red one isn't the one you want. The ability he gets instead is only useful to an elemental-type, since when he uses Scorched Earth, he damages himself. (Ugly, too.)<br /><br />2. Get a Rat-type which uses <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=163">Stampede</a>. (Use a pokemon with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=581">Flock</a> instead if you so desire.)<br /><br />3. Put your Dragon out right before your Rat. He's strong on his own, so he should be able to take down at least one elite by himself, with time left over to cast Call Lightning if it's not already up.<br /><br />4. Make sure Call Lightning is up when your Rat comes out.<br /><br />5. Cast Stampede.<br /><br />6. Win.<br /><br />Here's how this works: The lightning effect does extra damage on each hit. Stampede not only hits three times, but causes your opponent to take double damage as well. This is an amasing way to actually win with a fairly weak pokemon (the Rat, not the Dragon). It's a combo at least equal to the one that horrible <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=66738">Yon</a>'s disgusting goat uses to one-shot you. (Fly, Dig, or Dive there.)<br /><br />As a side note, if <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=66741">Aki</a>'s Dragon casts call Lightning, use Stampede immediately and watch as reckless Dragon kills its own dumb self.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LeeShu</b></h3>I can't say for sure but i think all wild cloud serpent pets spawn only day time.

Today i logged in at 3 pm realm time and it was full of them, in 1 hour i farmed a rare for every color.<br />Edit: a friend of mine told me that this is true ( he camped a few times at night because is better to farm pets at night when less players are online and he found nothing; he checked the spot day time and it was full of those pets).
