Kill them if you're bored and have nothing better to do, but I slaughtered them three times in a row and saw no pet spawns, but when I ignored them to either put shurikens into other pets to force respawns (and later, out of sheer goddamn spite) I saw mini-whirly-winds. There are no \"mama-twisters\" that spawn \"baby-twisters.\" :(\r\n\r\n2) They seem to share spawns with other pets, but I'm not sure if it's a rare spawn or just very freaking low because it's ONE at a damn time instead of scads across the zone like everything else. I've never seen more than one up at a time, and on two occasions after killing it, I got a second one within three minutes. In fact, that second quick respawn was my rare capture, for which I nearly cheered out loud except that it is three in the morning and that's impolite to others that are abed like civilized folk.\r\n\r\nBefore this capture, however, after about an hour and a half of actively faffing about the zone I just sat and camped the ring to see if they were on a timer, but as I already said, I left every ten or fifteen for only a minute or two to stick pointy things into other things because SPITE, damnit! I started this post within seconds of nabbing my rare, and I still don't see another, so to all of you who are still hunting, I wish you the best of RNG-luck and encourage you to just have patience.

A fifth spawned approx 10minutes later and 3 more at around 5am server time. Guessing repop is 10-30min.</div>

Often when facing them the secondary pet was a Ram and idk if this is a bug or not but he could not be captured.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>578928</b></h3>Not only at night. Caught mine at 4pm server. They are very cute. Beasts work very well against them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1037258</b></h3>I found 2 of these spawned at 5pm server time. I actually have alts camped out around the maps for these types of spawns. No rare spawn, just a poor quality and common so far.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1037258</b></h3>Two more spawned at 6pm server. so about 30-45 minute respawn. And only seems to be 2 or 3 at a time thus far. Also their cyclone ability seems to glitch up for a minute or so</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>computerweekend</b></h3>I'd been trying to find these guys for the past two days, and then just happened to find a group of about 7 around the circle of outer binding at 6:20am server. After I fought them, none respawned, but I didn't wait around any longer than 10 minutes. The thundering exiles are NOT placeholders. Don't bother killing them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1037412</b></h3>Caught mines around 2:40am (Eastern). Strange thing is that there was only one in the area (Circle of Outer Binding) when I arrived. Another player beat me to it, and it took several minutes till another one (again, the 'only one') spawned. Mines was an uncommon quality.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>258894</b></h3>Anyone found a good use for this guy?<br /><br />His attacks are flying which are strong against aquatics, but he is an elemental which is weak against aquatic attacks. Seems to cancel out any benefit.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1038667</b></h3>Tiny Twister is found at the ring of outer binding. Realm time was 12:27am - Smolderthorn. Killed critters and combat pets around zone. Found 2-3 of them spawning using this method, average about 5-10 minutes apart. In one hour I had captured 2 uncommons and yet to grab the rare but I will update with stats if it comes to that.<br /><br />Poor - 412HP , 62 Power, 52 Speed.<br /><br />Uncommon - 520HP, 67 power , 67 Speed.<br /><br />*interesting note. Cats seem to enjoy backing this creature up in a fight. Who would have thought.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>910895</b></h3>I found one around 5:45 am. Unfortunately, my PvP flag was still on from my go at the Undercity Rat, and a Goblin Mage interrupted my pet battle by killing me. I ... wasn't aware that could happen. I'm sure I'll find another.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Farzeer</b></h3>Do these guys despawn? I flew from undercity using flight points and it went over the circle of outer binding. I saw a ton of them in minimap. Flew back there on my mount just to see that there wasn't any of them there. :s It took me less than 2 minutes to get there so there's no way someone would've been able to kill all of them in that time. (Didn't even see anyone anywhere)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>86356</b></h3>Logged in over the circle of outer binding early in the morning, no Twisters. After flying around for a bit, i went to check for Tiny Bog beasts. About 40 minutes later I returned to the circle, it was raining, and there were about 8 twisters. I captured one uncommon twister (and a common cat as backup). <br /><br />I stayed around for another half hour, killing elementals, but only had one more Tiny Twister spawn after battling the existing lot. It was raining the whole time. I think rain may initially cause them to spawn, but not affect further spawning.<br /><br />Edit: flew by in the afternoon, no rain and about a dozen twisters. Fought them all and caught a rare. As before, shortly after I finished the last one, one more spawned, then nothing.<br /><br />This pet is only strong against aquatics, which are strong against elementals, making him the most useless pet I have seen so far. Unless you are compulsive, don't waste your time going for a rare, just cap one for the pet count and move on.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>336870</b></h3>these pets are NOT dependent on time or weather, at all.<br /><br />they are affected by killing other battle pets in the zone. anytime a pet is killed in the zone, and the zone respawns a replacement pet, it has a chance to respawn on a Tiny Twister spawn point.<br /><br />because there aren't as many twister spawn points as the rest of the zone, it makes it a rather uncommon spawn. it is so simple to merely range out and kill battle pets outright (or battle them if you want) and circle back to the mound to see if one spawned.<br /><br /><i>i did this twice, and there was a twister spawn. unfortunately, when i battled it, my pet team was too high in level and couldn't attack it without killing it. so, i had to concede. i swapped my pet team and did a couple more passes killing battle pets around the zone. a few minutes later a twister spawned on the mound and i captured that one (uncommon)</i> EDIT: this was a problem back when pets despawned if you conceded the battle<br /><br />and no... the Thundering Exiles are NOT placeholders.<br /><br />EDIT: you still need to wait for respawn timers (5-6 minutes) after killing other pets in the zone. and this is not the only pet like this. this behavior has been around since vanilla on more than battle pets -- regular mobs, fishing nodes, mining nodes, etc.<br /><br />and pay no attention to the comment reply by Khedrak below. many of us have proven him completely wrong -- or at least proven he has the worst luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>209573</b></h3>I've been hunting this unbottled little fart for what I guess to be three hours now, and from what I can tell:<br /><br />1) They are NOT bound to the Thundering Exiles. Kill them if you're bored and have nothing better to do, but I slaughtered them three times in a row and saw no pet spawns, but when I ignored them to either put shurikens into other pets to force respawns (and later, out of sheer goddamn spite) I saw mini-whirly-winds. There are no &quot;mama-twisters&quot; that spawn &quot;baby-twisters.&quot; :(<br /><br />2) They seem to share spawns with other pets, but I'm not sure if it's a rare spawn or just very freaking low because it's ONE at a damn time instead of scads across the zone like everything else. I've never seen more than one up at a time, and on two occasions after killing it, I got a second one within three minutes. In fact, that second quick respawn was my rare capture, for which I nearly cheered out loud except that it is three in the morning and that's impolite to others that are abed like civilized folk.<br /><br />Before this capture, however, after about an hour and a half of actively faffing about the zone I just sat and camped the ring to see if they were on a timer, but as I already said, I left every ten or fifteen for only a minute or two to stick pointy things into other things because SPITE, damnit! I started this post within seconds of nabbing my rare, and I still don't see another, so to all of you who are still hunting, I wish you the best of RNG-luck and encourage you to just have patience. A good book or something to watch on the TV doesn't hurt, either. :)<br /><br />--Wait, another just popped up under me. I'm leaving him alone for someone else (because I'm awesome like that), so- Okay, I am doubly wrong, there are TWO under me right now. One spawned within twenty to thirty seconds of the other, and I'm coherent enough to take screenshots. According to /who I am the only person out here, so it doesn't look like anyone is hunting pets. I really hope that this info helps in SOME way. Good hunting! (Also, they've been up for about ten minutes now, because it's taken me this long to type, so it looks like they don't despawn as someone else asked, and there are no weather effects up at this time.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>776458</b></h3>So, the Thundering Exiles have a respawn rate of approximately 5mins. I can run around and kill all the critters, kill the Exiles, run around and look for critters and come back and kill more Exiles before the critters seem to respawn again. <br />The critters in the surrounding area (I went south into a group of spiders and killed two critters and noted the time I killed them and the time I saw them again) seem to have a longer spawn rate of about 10mins. <br />Considering I ran around the Circle four times, killing all the critters I could see, this seems to be a very time-consuming battle pet to get.<br />The critters at the Dabyrie Farm do not seem to share a spawn timer with Tiny Twister as they didn't seem to have impact on the other critters closer to the Circle when I killed them. <br />So, my route was the outskirts of Refuge Point, over to the outskirts of Dabyrie Farm, to the other side of that little hill West of the Circle (approximately 53,51), into the group of spiders across the path/road (approximately 47,57), and then over to the other side of the those three big stones with the fire pit in the middle, circling the far side of the pointy stone mountain (approximately 44,60). There actually aren't a lot of critters around, mostly there are just Grassland Cottontails and Prairie Dogs in little &quot;groups&quot; of twos or threes. I figure that's why the critters at Dabyrie Farm don't seem to share a spawn time, because they are rats instead.<br />And Horde, you might note that there are no critters in Refuge Point so there isn't any reason to go in there, thinking they might share a spawn timer, and flag yourself if you don't want to.<br />About an hour and a half, maybe close to two hours later and still no Tiny Twister. Judging by the Alliance Mage parked on top one of the stone pillars, they aren't having any luck either. I no longer want to do all the work of running around killing critters to get the one I want to spawn only to have that guy swoop in and snag it so I'm going to come back later.</div>

I read through the previous comments, and decided to give the theory of killing elsewhere and hoping for spawns to be created at the circle a try.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1062573</b></h3>I can confirm that this doesn't appear to follow the standard respawn mechanics of &quot;kill enough pets in the zone, get some of what you want to spawn&quot;. I spent a long time killing pets and was unable to get a single Twister to spawn (which is something I've done with many other rare pets); I had no success. I came back later and like 8 had spawned. It may not be a weather thing, but there does appear to be some sort of mechanic that makes a group of them spawn at a time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1101420</b></h3>I just got there today and there was one tiny twister standing outside the circle. Poor Quality and I accidentally killed him. :( I've killed 3 groups of twisters so far, and surrounding critters while waiting for the twisters to respawn and no luck yet. <br /><br />And the wait continues..<br /><br />Immediately after posting this, I tabbed back into wow and there was a Tiny Twister, on the further outside edges of where the twisters spawn. Poor Quality, but I got him this time!<br /><br />I'll also add after updating, and tabbing back into wow for a 2nd time there was another Tiny Twister, I left it for someone else though.<br /><br />It seems like just killing the twisters seems to spawn the Tiny Twisters. That's all I did in the end.<br /><br />Update: <br />I have continually just sat here to kill the big twisters. There are 4 Tiny Twisters spawned right now, and at least one more comes after each round of killing the big twisters. No one else is around, I seem to be the only one in the area, with the exception of one or 2 lowbies I've seen.</div>

There were no TTs up at the circle, so I: <br /><br />1) killed all critters in the immediate area. <br /><br />2) killed all the Thun Exiles (yes, I know it is probably not necessary; just makes it easier for me personally to see/target the TTs) in the immediate area.<br /><br />3) I ONLY did a circle of Goshek farm, roughly following the road. I battled any wilds that had an upgrade for me, and just nuked anything without an upgrade primary possibility (I don't start battles w/ every one and then abandon/concede). Made one full clockwise circle like this, also nuking any wild critters in range.<br /><br />went back to the circle, and already had 2 TTs up. They were both poor quality, so I battled for the exp, and then repeated 1-3. <br /><br />This circuit was faster, as less spawns up, but by the time I got back, 1 TT had already spawned. It was my rare, and got it no problem (Terrible Turnip is your friend for capping!). While I battled that one, 2 more spawned. I notified the zone, then went off looking for something else. Flew by once more, and there were 4 total up. Announced again &amp; left out, as they aren't cagable.<br /><br />(but now I wonder if a team of 3 could just cyclone/swap/cyclone/swap? if so . . . wow!)<br /><br />All this was done in 30+/- minutes. <br /><br />Then I was off to look for my Lofty Libram - I have my Uncommon; trying for my Rare now.<br /><br />Best of luck!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dragonspirit1</b></h3>On Tuesday, immediately after servers came back up, I found about 15 of these guys all around the area. <br /><br />This was a huge relief after camping them for a few hours yielded nothing. Not only was I able to catch one, but I fought a bunch until I got a rare. Definitely recommend doing this over camping.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1062417</b></h3>As of 11/04/13 I flew over Circle of Outer Binding in Arathi Basin and found one of these little guys floating around on the ground as soon as i got there. There was no need for me to kill any other critter to get him. I did however accidentally kill the first one i found due to my pet being too high level. I flew to a lake found a pet the same level as the twister, when i went back to the circle aprx: 10 mins later, there was the pet and he was rare. So i hope this helps anyone else.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Malholis</b></h3>Just found one of these around the Circle of Outer Binding. Not sure what caused the spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Malthmazar</b></h3>Read all the comments. It's not server/time based. There weren't any at the time I arrived. So I flew along the edge of the mountains, and killed all pets i saw. Helped a guy do a quest in Stromgarde Keep (SW area on map). Returned to circle, and there was one that spawned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>radicarl</b></h3>How does this pet not know the Sandstorm ability is what I want to know...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xanthiras</b></h3>The way they spawn is odd and not necessarily just tied to killing other pets in the area.<br />If fly to the circle, saw a lone twister there. Battled it, after finishing I saw twisters all over their spawn area - something like 15-20 of them. I was the only person in my faction in Arathi at the time, so doubt anyone else was mass-killing those.<br />(Oh, and I did get the rare out of them).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>turainia</b></h3>When I logged into my priest who was parked in the area. I was happy to find at least a dozen of these little guys! Got 3 rares! This is on Cenarius realm.... Good luck everyone! They are out there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Neozaki</b></h3>Camped the area for around two hours without a single spawn. <br /><br />Decided to put a character I have on a low-population server on the spot, and there were dozens! <br />If you're on a high-pop server, try visiting a low-pop one by having a character there, or having someone from there invite you. It might save you a lot of time!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AshDT</b></h3>I have recently got back in to wow and been enjoying the pokemon part. Many of the comments have helped but on this page it is very ...convoluted. My experience was in the day killing stuff and doing what was recommended and nothing, showed up at 5am server time and bam at least 5 of this just twisting about. Thanks folks!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ohmyforce</b></h3>A tip for players looking for Tiny Twister in the WoD era: use <b>Premade Groups</b>!<br /><br />Today I was in Arathi Highlands, following the usual strategy (kill 5-10 pets in the area, and return to Circle of Outer Binding waiting for a Tiny Twister to spawn). I have done this several times and no luck. By chance I loaded Premade Groups, joined a Kazzak group (on a different realm) and I am not kidding, once I phased into the realm I was surrounded by 12+ Tiny Twisters.<br /><br />This was approx. 10AM server time, I am Draenor-EU and hopped to Chamber of Aspects-EU.<br /><br />I caught two, which I felt a little selfish about but grabbed a P/B Common and an H/P Uncommon from the two battles respectively. <br /><br /><b>TIP:</b> use a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63365/terrible-turnip">Terrible Turnip</a> with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=826/weakening-blow">Weakening Blow</a> -the attack cannot reduce an enemy to less than 1HP, great for capturing low level pets safely!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rrainn</b></h3>I did all the RUNNING around and killing around the zone for a couple hours, camped the spawn spot area, walked out and back in to the zone, etc. to no gain. <br />NOW 7 times in a row I have flown by taxi into Refuge Point in Arathi from Ironforge and BAM! about 7-12 of them. <br />So, I suggest if nothing else is working, leave the zone and fly (by Taxi) in to Refuge Point. Let me know if it works for you. Up-vote if it works for you please.<br />Remember your Terrible Turnip so you don't slaughter the little guys. And be kind if there are other farmers and leave some for them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Izeiy14</b></h3>Dalaran - US Server time 3:09am there are around 30 tiny twisters spawned at this moment. Did they change the spawn rate?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Isyali</b></h3>Just flew in, plenty of them spawned. Seeing as the other recent comments confirm spawns, I suppose a recent patch may have increased that?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>remid0d0s0</b></h3>If you need an Elemental pet to kill an Aquatic pet, Tiny Twister and Drafty are good options ... Tiny Twister is less trouble/cheaper though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JClay</b></h3>To my observations, after killing all the pets in the zone about 2 times, when these do spawn, they spawn in force. When they finally spawned, there was well over a dozen on the mound.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurjuns</b></h3>Today i tried to farm these as to kill other pets and critters and then wait at the hill of elementals.<br /><br />Suddenly around 10-15 tiny twisters spawned and the hill was swarming with them.<br /><br />So i guess, either they are there or not. Sadly i have no idea how or what triggered this event.<br /><br />Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>janaywj</b></h3>I just set the zone back to normal... after the changes from BFA.... to trick or treat, and tons of them were spawned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Proteinshake</b></h3>Notice that, to get this Pet in BFA. You need to change the area to an older story line at the NPC named Zidormi (cords 38 / 89 )<br />Have fun</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Snapblaster</b></h3>I spent about 45 minutes killing critters in the zone and checking back the spawn area and none ever showed up. I finally decided to go to the Bronze Dragon and put the zone back to level 60 and when I checked there were about 10 of them. Try looking at the old version of the zone if you can't find any.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sunnitokes</b></h3>ok i spent days doing this and i decided to link my bnet just to write this because it was on the top comments.<br />go talk to zidormi, and youll find a crap ton of these guys just waiting there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jahiera</b></h3>I waited and waited for this little guy to spawn and nothing. I did everything that everybody said about going and killing other pets in other areas and still nothing. Decided to travel back in time to how the area use to look and boom, tons of the tiny twisters in the area that everybody said they would be. I even got a rare. Time traveler is down near the stone bridge between the Wetlands and Arathi Highlands.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Desoloth</b></h3>Tiny Twisters are on a hard 30-60 minute timer (might be &gt;1 hour, even), they do not compete for respawn nodes, so killing other Arathi battle pets will not get them to appear faster. Tested after farming for more than 5 hours.<br /><br />This is why other commenters found that clearing other pets was not working, then several Tiny Twisters suddenly spawned in - this was the respawn timer running out 1 hour after another player had cleared all the Twisters at the Circle of Outer Binding.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dataking</b></h3>As of 9.0.5 (Shadowlands), if you talk to <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=141649/zidormi">Zidormi</a> and set the time period back to pre-BfA, it will be a big help. Go to the Circle of Outer Binding just south and east of Refuge Point. There are a bunch there or were when I captured mine.<br /><br />For those using coords:<br /><ul><li>Zidormi is at 38.04, 89.94</li><li>Circle of Outer Binding is around 47.53, 51.52</li></ul></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dovalmp</b></h3>I used the NPC with the bubble to talk to and go back in time and the Tiny Twisters were all where they were supposed to be. =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jlandeen</b></h3>Tip - If you killed all the ones at the spawn location (near 45, 52 in the old version of the zone), it will take a LONG time for them to come back.<br />You can speed this process up greatly (and get a fresh 10 by going to your capitol city and turning warmode on (or off if you had it on). This will &quot;reset&quot; the zone and you will have a fresh 10 to look at.<br /><br />Happy hunting (FYI you want a P/B H/S for one of the Flummoxed achievements w/ all elementals).</div>
