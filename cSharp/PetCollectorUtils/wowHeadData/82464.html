<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MyPetsAreEpic</b></h3>The <a href="/npc=82464/elekk-plushie">Elekk Plushie</a> is dead weight on your team, as its abilities deal no damage. The Elekk can be obtained trough tailoring: <a href="/item=114865/pattern-elekk-plushie">Pattern: Elekk Plushie</a><br /><br />There are two achievements for using an Elekk Plushie: <a href="/achievement=9069/an-awfully-big-adventure">An Awfully Big Adventure</a> and <a href="/achievement=9070/overstuffed">Overstuffed</a>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>496978</b></h3>The biggest thing I want to emphasize about this pet is:<br />DO NOT USE A STONE TO UPGRADE IT! (Not right away.)<br /><br />Leave it at Common, it has a truckload of health. Even at Common, its health will be over 2000 at level 25, which is more than plenty to do the achievements. It can't fight anyway so it shouldn't ever be soaking more than a hit here and there.<br /><br />Instead, once you are finished with your achievements, THEN use a stone to lower its level below 25 so you can sell it easier to a buyer wishing to get Overstuffed and Awfully Long Adventure. This will be the best way to preserve the value of your plushie for savvy buyers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Berl</b></h3>I'd like to get an Elekk Plushie in real life; Blizzard should look into this its so cute. They made gryphon, wolf pup, nether faerie dragon, and wyvern plushes why not this feller?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Groovejet14</b></h3>If you wanted a cute little plushie to bounce along behind your character, you're to be sorely disappointed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AeroKargath</b></h3>Today's pet battle daily with Grubbles, Scrags, and Stings is super easy to level the Elekk Plushie. With Xu-Fu you can solo all three bosses and when the last is about to die you simply let Xu-Fu die and bring in the plushie. He takes a hit and you pass along to your next pet to finalize the xp.<br /><br />With lesser treat and cap he gets 3-4k xp.<br /><br />They appear to have hot-fixed the pet battles here so you cannot gain xp and level pets any longer. Doh!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zeldendorf</b></h3>Elekk Plushie isn't as deadweight as people might first think, it effectively can be used as a damage sponge when you don't want your 2 active pets taking big hits.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/petability=1347"> Cute as a Button</a><br />Actually increases the plushie's chance to dodge by 25% (Unless the tooltip is bugged), so it can actually tank a barrage of damage if the situation calls for it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=1337#used-by">Itchin' for a Stitchin'</a><br />Causes your Elekk Plushie to switch out with the pet in your #2 slot, effectively giving you a free swap back to your pet after your plushie has taken a hit. Also, unlike some other pet swap mechanics, it doesn't always go first, so your plush will be guaranteed to take the hit<br /><br />Elekk Plushie essentially allows your &quot;Switch Pet&quot; to turn into a <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Substitute" rel="nofollow">substitute</a> button</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>aspasito</b></h3>If you're obsessive and dislike having a white quality pet in your list, the Plushie, like a big real Elekk, can be upgraded with a magic or flawless battle stone. This will also cause it to lose two levels if it is maxed as in all level 25 pets, which can be used to level it up to 25 again if for some reason you find a max level one for sale, you can still use it to get the Overstuffed achievement by raring it up and leveling again.</div>

The stitched blue elekk plushie looks like Pooh's Eeyore. Pooh's movies are always an adventure and one film is named Pooh's Grand Adventure.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mythaltian</b></h3>This is basically the World of Warcraft version of the Pokemon attack Substitute, in which the user of the move uses one quarter of its health in order to create a &quot;substitute&quot; which takes all damage for its duration. It is destroyed when the opposing enemy reduce's the dummy's HP to zero, as the substitute has 25% of the user's max health plus 1 health point. The substitute takes all status conditions(poisoned, confused, etc.) that are self-inflicted or obtained by an enemy ability or move. Thus, this Elekk Plushie is essentially a walking fluffsack. (Well I can't call it a meatsack, it doesn't have any flesh. :P)<br /><br />External Sources of Information: <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Substitute_%28move%29" rel="nofollow">http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Substitute_%28move%29</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>enough01</b></h3>Goodday all,<br /><br />What a great battle pet is Elekk Pushie! It can't do anything but it can do 1 smart thing, doing no damage @ all. That's a great thrick when battle pets get healed by damage taken:)<br /><br />I tried to defeat Deeps Tyri and Puzzle with: Xu-Fu Zandalari and Elekk Pushie (level 14) &quot;The greatest batte-pet in the world&quot; Yes it was easy, and I had a big smile about during the battle. <br /><br />Elekk Pushie is just like playing Wow,<br /><br />Because playing wow means that: you can't work, you can't study you can't have fun in real life, but you can have fun (during Wow).<br /><br />You see Elekk Pushie is fun!<br /><br />Have fun with Elekk Pushie &quot;The greatest battle-pet in the World&quot; <br /><br />Have a nice day with lots of fun!</div>
