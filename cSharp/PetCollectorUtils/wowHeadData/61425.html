The other half are its â€œFireâ€ moves, elemental-type abilities that give it a good toolbox. Overall, Iâ€™ve found that there are three effective ways to run these guys\r\n\r\n1) The Fire Spider (Burn, Cauterize, your choice of Final Ability)\r\nDeals elemental damage regularly, regains a good deal of health occasionally.  If your Spider is exceptionally tough, Magma Wave will let you build damage on an entire enemy team.  If your spider isnâ€™t as tough or you donâ€™t want to lead with it, Brittle Webbing is better damage on your current target\r\n\r\n2) The Webmaster (Leech Life, Sticky Webbing, Brittle Webbing)\r\nHolds the target in place, Applies continuing damage, and regains some health regularly.  You want to keep both your webs applied if possible, and leech life as often as you can.  This build tends to grind down opponents faster than you think, thanks to Brittle Webbing\r\n\r\n3) The Tank (Leech Life, Cauterize, Brittle Webbing)\r\nThis has the minor issue of using Brittle Webbing as a core damage ability, which means its DPR is quite a lot lower than it could be with Sticky or Burn.  What you lose in damage, though, you make up for in longevity.  Alternating webbing and Leech Life is bad enough, but being able to Cauterize after big hits is especially

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>746772</b></h3>I think these must only spawn at certain times of day. I did not see even one from 2 pm to 7 pm server. I tried battling other pets in the lava hoping it would show up as a second pet or at the very least trigger one as a respawn. But still I did not see one. Next morning I went out there at 8 am and they were available. I don't know the exact times, but I would expect to find them later at night or early morning.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wiseguy149</b></h3>These pets will only spawn in the lava pools across this zone. That said, they're a relatively uncommon spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>FatCheeseMan</b></h3>Caught one, came back to the same spot a bit later hoping for another spawn and there was a lava crab there, leading me to believe that they share the same spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>elstohn</b></h3>Ive seen them from early am, through late pm, and any time based observation probably has less to do with the spawn, and more to do with the population of players that are there to farm them. they seem to be rare spawns at best, and out of 100+ fights ive had in the zone, i have NEVER seen a molten hatchling as an add in another battle, (including lava crabs which appear to share the spawn points)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jiffyrocks</b></h3>They do spawn during the day. Just gotta kill/capture the ones near the lava pools to make them spawn. Seen two so far. Been at it for a few hours.</div>

I fought one with 580 health and it turned out to be a rare. So cathc every one you come across because you never know!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ressar</b></h3>Found one of these today as I was just leveling some of my other pets. He was sitting in between a bunch of regular mobs so I cleared them out with a Howling Blast.<br /><br />Turns out, battle pets can still die from AoEs.<br /><br />And now I come here to find that they're super rare. I feel awful. :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ansawa</b></h3>Running around killing all the lava crabs in the lava pools--whether they were available to battle or not--seemed to have a chance to force a spawn of the molten hatchlings.<br /><br />This isn't a really exact science, though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Grebog</b></h3>I have seen them spawn at any time during the day/night. The problem is they share spawn points with the Lava Crab and only spawn in the lava patches in the zone. As this limits the amount of area they spawn and fighting for spawning with another battle pet, makes them rare to find. I would also guess that they have a lower chance to spawn compared to the lava crab.<br /><br />Right now I would venture to guess that the spawn rate is 75% lava crab and 25% Molten Hatchling.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bobbigmac</b></h3>These do indeed spawn only immediately *on* the lava pools, and seem to share spawn points with the lava crabs.<br /><br />I did a full circuit of Searing Gorge (around 4am so no competition), killing (not fighting) every critter on or near a lava pool (mostly lava crabs), then waited about 15 minutes before doing another circuit to find at least one molten hatchling in about half of the pools I had killed lava crabs in.<br /><br />Mostly uncommon, with ~564 hp and poor fire beetles as secondary. Never encountered a molten hatchling as a secondary pet to anything else in other runs. Beat ~15 hatchlings and did not encounter a rare yet.<br /><br />They don't seem to be rare spawns, as they share with lava crabs on roughly 2:1/3:1 per point, I think the rarity is just because people are cherry-picking the hatchlings as they spawn, leaving the crabs behind. Clear everything and you'll get the hatchling :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1055674</b></h3>I managed to get a rare quality close to 3pm server time. health was 608 when combat began.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>341848</b></h3>I really enjoyed fighting with this guy after I captured it. The Magma Wave does damage to the entire team, not just the front pet, and does not have a cooldown. With Leech Life and/or Cauterize to heal the hatchling back up, and provided the front pet of the other team isn't doing overwhelming damage, he can bring almost the entire team down without needing to swap.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>781493</b></h3>If you try to battle this pet around the 38,76 you will most likely get the &quot;Pet Battle Area is Obstructed&quot; message as the terrain is very odd in that little area.<br /><br />I had to try several different angles for it to work and almost lost it to an other player who swooped down trying to snag it for himself.<br /><br />I saw two of these <a href="/npc=61425/molten-hatchling">Molten Hatchling</a> in about 45 minutes time, accidentaly killed the first one : /<br /><br />Edit: Nice pet to match the Colossal Dragonplate Battlegear <a href="/transmog-set=1244/colossal-dragonplate-battlegear-normal-lookalike">Colossal Dragonplate Battlegear (Normal Lookalike)</a> set</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ameelia</b></h3>After about 3 hours trying to get a rare one of these, I agree with many of the comments below, that these spawn in any lava area where lava crabs normally spawn.<br /><br />There also seems to be a cap on how many total battle pets can be spawned in a zone, so if you see any battle ash spiders or fire beetles, kill them too. What I found was there is a small camp south of the &quot;sea of cinders&quot; area with many many spider critters, at any one time 5 of these could be battle pets, when I started regularly killing all the spiders here, there seemed to be a lot more Lava crabs I could battle. <br /><br />Molten hatchlings <u>never </u>spawn as an additional battle pet.<br /><br />So as a couple of helpful pointers, kill all battle pets you see, kill all lava crabs you see.<br />Make sure you patrol the whole zone as there are a couple of out of the way places where people don't go and the battle pets will build upin these places. Good luck, even with artificially stimulating the spawns like this, these are very rare spiders.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Teevo</b></h3>There is alot of talk regarding certain battle pets being hard to find... or not hard to find. Obviously, everyone's experiences will be different. There is one highly rated comment on here stating they arent rare, you just need to kill more pets in the area.<br /><br />While this seems to be true, it doesnt change the fact that they are still one of the more harder to come by battle pets out there. Are they like the Minfernal or Scourged Whelpling? Of course not. But there are different levels of rarity.. which from what I have read about this little guy, seems to be about a 7.5 on a scale of 1-10 (10 being most rare). Took me a week to find my rare one after finding about 20-30 of the other versions.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TevishSzat</b></h3>The Molten Hatching is an interesting creature â€“ half its moves are traditional spider, but those are in different slots, allowing it a build impossible to conventional spiders. The other half are its â€œFireâ€ moves, elemental-type abilities that give it a good toolbox. Overall, Iâ€™ve found that there are three effective ways to run these guys<br /><br />1) The Fire Spider (Burn, Cauterize, your choice of Final Ability)<br />Deals elemental damage regularly, regains a good deal of health occasionally. If your Spider is exceptionally tough, Magma Wave will let you build damage on an entire enemy team. If your spider isnâ€™t as tough or you donâ€™t want to lead with it, Brittle Webbing is better damage on your current target<br /><br />2) The Webmaster (Leech Life, Sticky Webbing, Brittle Webbing)<br />Holds the target in place, Applies continuing damage, and regains some health regularly. You want to keep both your webs applied if possible, and leech life as often as you can. This build tends to grind down opponents faster than you think, thanks to Brittle Webbing<br /><br />3) The Tank (Leech Life, Cauterize, Brittle Webbing)<br />This has the minor issue of using Brittle Webbing as a core damage ability, which means its DPR is quite a lot lower than it could be with Sticky or Burn. What you lose in damage, though, you make up for in longevity. Alternating webbing and Leech Life is bad enough, but being able to Cauterize after big hits is especially brutal</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nivrax</b></h3>Unlike what wowhead states, they do come in four different breeds (confirmed by myself catching speedy one): #3 B/B, #5 S/S, #8 P/S and #11 S/B.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>575542</b></h3>This is my favourite pet because: Brittle webbing + leach life + cauterize + leach life = insane amount of heals, + then brittle webbing has fallen off and you rense and repeat. Now you may have noticed that leach life and brittle webbing don't do that much damage, but most of the damage also come from the effect brittle webbing have. Specially during multi attack abilities which some use, eks: Attack hit 1-2 times, and an additional if faster then the enemy.<br /><br />Combined with the huge amount og base speed this pet has... it's simply amazing. But, if like Nivrax said earlier: <div class="quote-box">Unlike what wowhead states, they do come in four different breeds (confirmed by myself catching speedy one): #3 B/B, #5 S/S, #8 P/S and #11 S/B.</div><br />and there exist a S/S, then this will be the pet with the highest amount of speed i have ever seen (not including bird over 50% hp buff)<br /><br />Edit: Can confirm that there are other breeds then S/B, as i myself got a B/B...(though with an unusual 292 str 292 speed instead of 293/293 as it say in the breed list on this page.)</div>
