Tamed him as a gray pet, no others in area to try for rare. Good luck on getting a blue one.<br /><br />Also tried battling others to see if it joined battle but no luck.<br /><br />Edit #2- Found a second hatchling, they seem to follow elders around. This one was uncommon quality. It was found about 10 minutes after finding the poor quality hatchling.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>As mentioned, these small creatures follow the Elder Diemetradons around, linked. This means that likely, the Elders have a chance to spawn with a baby, so if you are having problems finding a Diemetradon Hatchling, try killing the elders and see if one of them spawns with baby 'intact'.<br /><br />When clicked, the babies make quite a loud hissing sound, much higher in pitch than the adults' growling, but no less menacing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>602360</b></h3>These do spawn when the elders are spawned, I'd say it may be a 5% rate that they spawn, cause out of each batch after killing the elders maybe 1-2 spawned. <br /><br />If your looking for a rare, settle in for a very long farm. It took me about an hr and 7 batches of elders to see an uncommon. I finally got a Rare after 2 1/2 hrs. I honestly lost count at how many i killed</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kerluna</b></h3>As mentioned in several posts here, the Diemetradon Hatchlings are linked to the Elder Diemetradons. I found that not killing the Elder after battling the the Hatchling would cause a new Hatchling to spawn with that Elder within five minutes.<br /><br />So I went around killing all the Elder without Hatchlings. After about 30 minutes, I had around six or seven Hatchlings spawning every five minutes or so.<br /><br />So make sure when you're farming the Hatchlings, that you do not kill the Elder Diemetradon they are linked to.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1048957</b></h3>found one with in 10 mins late at night pure luck <br />location cords 41.96 - 73.61</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1054494</b></h3>Circle first and check all of the Diemetradon Elders for Diametradon Hatchlings. If you see a hatchling with an elder, mark the elder and do not engage, or kill the elder at any point. You can engage the hatchling and battle it however. <br /><br />I found that by circling and killing unmarked and childless Diametradon Elders, I was able to repeatedly spawn 2-3 new hatchlings in addition to respawns happening on marked elders that I had already battled the offspring of.<br /><br />If there was a battle pet, or a critter nearby, I killed those too. <br /><br />Even with another person interfering and snapping up diemetradon babies, I was able to get a white quality immediately and after a couple of greys, a rare quality. I left the rest that I had &quot;created&quot; for whomever else came along.</div>
