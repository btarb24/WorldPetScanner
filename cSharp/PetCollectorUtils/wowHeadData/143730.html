Accept a new daily quest [quest=53371] which requires you to farm 8 [item=156825] which drop from any mob in the Meadery. The Ancel in the hut doorway at the meadery flight point also offers the quest.\n8. Take the 8 [item=156825] back to Ancel and click on the vial on the table to turn them into [item=163720].\n9. \/tar Bumbles hovering next to Ancel and right-click on the [item=163720] in your bag then hand in the quest.\n10.

You can get this pet using a 110 Alliance trial account!\n\nMy friend recently posted his guide to getting Bumbles using an Alliance trial account [url=https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wow\/comments\/9zf11i\/bumble_is_achievable_on_a_class_trial_battle_pet\/]here[\/url]. However, if you're like me and don't use Reddit, I'll add some of the guide here.\n\n1. Make a 110 Alliance trial character. \n--Preferably on a high population server (see Step 3) and preferably a good AOE class. My friend chose Frost Mage, I chose Beast Mastery Hunter.\n\n2. Log in and port to Stormwind. \n--Your trial character should have their hearthstone automatically set to Stormwind and there's no need to complete the introduction to your class. In fact, I suggest you skip it to use as little of the [url=https:\/\/us.battle.net\/support\/en\/article\/64574]3 hour class trial limit [\/url]as possible. \n\n3. Once in Stormwind, find a friendly mage to port you to Boralus. \n--You won't be able to use the portal in the Mage tower and don't try completing the story to get there. It will take too long (you only have 3 hour remember?). If people are being particularly uncooperative, try \/who to find a mage in town. They must be level 111+. This is where a high population server comes in handy.\n--Don't let this take more than an hour!\n\n4. Once in Boralus, run over to Ancel Mildenhall at \/way 68.8, 65.2 in Stormsong Valley.\n--Grab a flight point in Boralus and the one near Ancel for later (Steps 7 & 8)!\n\n5. Complete the quest chain from [quest=50343] through [quest=50553].\n\n6. Farm [url=https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=141901\/bumbling-bee]Bumbling Bees[\/url] near \/way 44.0, 36.0 or \/way 24.0, 70.0 until you get the [item=163699].\n--You can farm[url=https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=133429\/bubbling-mead] Bubbling Meads[\/url], [url=https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=134155\/enraged-swarmer]Enraged Swarmers[\/url], or [url=https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=131663\/flowing-honey]Flowing Honeys[\/url] near the Meadery to get this amulet but they have more health and take longer to farm. \n--If farming for the Amulet takes past 1 hour and 50 minutes when looking at \/played, you may need to start over. This happened on my first trial after 400+ Bumbling Bee kills with no Amulet drop. On my second trial character, the Amulet dropped from the first Bumbling Bee kill (no exaggeration). \n\n7. Once you have the amulet, go find [url=https:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=143128\/rosaline-mildenhall#comments:id=2599562]Rosaline Mildenhall[\/url] in Boralus and talk to her until she gives you a letter for Ancel.\n--That link provides her [u]multiple[\/u] spawn points. \n\n8. Return to Ancel, give him the letter, and do the [quest=53347] quest. \n\n9. Ancel should now provide the daily quest [quest=53371]. You'll need to farm 8 [item=156825] from mobs near the Meadery, then go back into the basement, click on the vial on the table and apply it to Bumbles. Do this daily quest for 7 days and you'll complete the [achievement=13062] achievement and receive Bumbles in the mail.\n--It will likely take about 60 minutes to complete all 7 daily quests, which is why you don't want to farm for the Amulet too long in Step 6.\n\nOverall, it took my friend around 2.5 hours. On my second trial character it's taken me less than 2 hours. Good luck and For the Horde!","date":"2018-11-28T13:33:11-06:00","rating":44,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2018-11-28T13:42:08-06:00",2,"Beautrix"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":10,"id":2855418,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Mushalor","body":"The glitchy idle animation STILL isn't fixed as of Nov 28th.\r\n\r\nAND it doesn't follow you when you're on a flying mount (it merely vanishes as it's desummoned). Quite a number of other flying pets follow when on a flying mount (one of my favourite joys is having my sprite darter hatchling out on my druid while I'm in flight form!). IDK I was really hoping to have this pet following me around with my bee-themed hunter when the bee mount finally makes its debut. But the jittering animation is awful and having it constantly disappearing on me upon mounting up makes it less fun. (To my knowledge none of the other bee battle pets follow in flight either, they are all firmly grounded.)\r\n\r\nI could use an addon to force-summon each time, & the mage disc toy to ensure it flies, but that all kind of misses the whole point! For the effort put into obtaining this pet it's really kind of disappointing right now.\r\n\r\n(Also for the record I too find it weird it turns into a black bee since the bee we help heal up during the quest dailies is a traditional black-and-yellow honey bee.

DO THAT\nStep 10: Barry leaves the cave and you are now free to hunt the Jelly deposits all over Stormsong Valley.\n\nSide Note. Thin jelly=20 rep, combining the jellies to Blue or Royal is the same rep x 4 or X 8 so save time and just upgrade the jellies instead of turning in 1 at a time.\n\nRep can also be obtained from killing the smasher once a day & doing the sunny grass events, remember to stay all the way til the end a jelly deposit can spawn or you can get a quest item for 750 rep.\n\nSide Note: At honored I started getting Rich jelly from Jelly Deposits and at Revered I started to get Royal Jelly drops in addition to Rich jelly from Jelly deposits which made rep gain go faster.","date":"2019-09-25T12:26:56-05:00","rating":28,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Great walk-through.

Find <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=143128/rosaline-mildenhall#comments:id=2599562">Rosaline Mildenhall</a> in Boralus.<br />4. Listen to Rosaline's story and agree to bring a letter back to her kid, Ancel, in Mildenhall.<br />5. Bring the letter to Ancel in the basement laboratory and accept <a href="/quest=53347/bumbles-the-bee">Bumbles the Bee</a>. This quest is VERY short. You run south about 50 paces and collect <a href="/item=163780/raimonds-secret-ingredient">Raimond's Secret Ingredient</a> from a table in a cave.<br />6. Return to the lab and complete the quest.<br />7. Accept a new daily quest <a href="/quest=53371/lets-bee-friends">Let's Bee Friends</a> which requires you to farm 8 <a href="/item=156825/vial-of-honey-slime">Vial of Honey Slime</a> which drop from any mob in the Meadery. The Ancel in the hut doorway at the meadery flight point also offers the quest.<br />8. Take the 8 <a href="/item=156825/vial-of-honey-slime">Vial of Honey Slime</a> back to Ancel and click on the vial on the table to turn them into <a href="/item=163720/mildenhall-growth-formula">Mildenhall Growth Formula</a>.<br />9. /tar Bumbles hovering next to Ancel and right-click on the <a href="/item=163720/mildenhall-growth-formula">Mildenhall Growth Formula</a> in your bag then hand in the quest.<br />10.

His animation has a stutter, he blinks out and appears much higher up a fraction of a second later. Over and over. It's annoying, considering you do have to put some effort into obtaining him.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Beautrix</b></h3>Good news Horde-only players! You can get this pet using a 110 Alliance trial account!<br /><br />My friend recently posted his guide to getting Bumbles using an Alliance trial account <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9zf11i/bumble_is_achievable_on_a_class_trial_battle_pet/">here</a>. However, if you're like me and don't use Reddit, I'll add some of the guide here.<br /><br />1. Make a 110 Alliance trial character. <br />--Preferably on a high population server (see Step 3) and preferably a good AOE class. My friend chose Frost Mage, I chose Beast Mastery Hunter.<br /><br />2. Log in and port to Stormwind. <br />--Your trial character should have their hearthstone automatically set to Stormwind and there's no need to complete the introduction to your class. In fact, I suggest you skip it to use as little of the <a href="https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/64574" rel="nofollow">3 hour class trial limit </a>as possible. <br /><br />3. Once in Stormwind, find a friendly mage to port you to Boralus. <br />--You won't be able to use the portal in the Mage tower and don't try completing the story to get there. It will take too long (you only have 3 hour remember?). If people are being particularly uncooperative, try /who to find a mage in town. They must be level 111+. This is where a high population server comes in handy.<br />--Don't let this take more than an hour!<br /><br />4. Once in Boralus, run over to Ancel Mildenhall at /way 68.8, 65.2 in Stormsong Valley.<br />--Grab a flight point in Boralus and the one near Ancel for later (Steps 7 &amp; 8)!<br /><br />5. Complete the quest chain from <a href="/quest=50343/mayhem-at-mildenhall-meadery">Mayhem at Mildenhall Meadery</a> through <a href="/quest=50553/back-to-the-lab">Back to the Lab</a>.<br /><br />6. Farm <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=141901/bumbling-bee">Bumbling Bees</a> near /way 44.0, 36.0 or /way 24.0, 70.0 until you get the <a href="/item=163699/annealed-honey-amulet">Annealed Honey Amulet</a>.<br />--You can farm<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=133429/bubbling-mead"> Bubbling Meads</a>, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=134155/enraged-swarmer">Enraged Swarmers</a>, or <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=131663/flowing-honey">Flowing Honeys</a> near the Meadery to get this amulet but they have more health and take longer to farm. <br />--If farming for the Amulet takes past 1 hour and 50 minutes when looking at /played, you may need to start over. This happened on my first trial after 400+ Bumbling Bee kills with no Amulet drop. On my second trial character, the Amulet dropped from the first Bumbling Bee kill (no exaggeration). <br /><br />7. Once you have the amulet, go find <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=143128/rosaline-mildenhall#comments:id=2599562">Rosaline Mildenhall</a> in Boralus and talk to her until she gives you a letter for Ancel.<br />--That link provides her <u>multiple</u> spawn points. <br /><br />8. Return to Ancel, give him the letter, and do the <a href="/quest=53347/bumbles-the-bee">Bumbles the Bee</a> quest. <br /><br />9. Ancel should now provide the daily quest <a href="/quest=53371/lets-bee-friends">Let's Bee Friends</a>. You'll need to farm 8 <a href="/item=156825/vial-of-honey-slime">Vial of Honey Slime</a> from mobs near the Meadery, then go back into the basement, click on the vial on the table and apply it to Bumbles. Do this daily quest for 7 days and you'll complete the <a href="/achievement=13062/lets-bee-friends">Let's Bee Friends</a> achievement and receive Bumbles in the mail.<br />--It will likely take about 60 minutes to complete all 7 daily quests, which is why you don't want to farm for the Amulet too long in Step 6.<br /><br />Overall, it took my friend around 2.5 hours. On my second trial character it's taken me less than 2 hours. Good luck and For the Horde!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mushalor</b></h3>The glitchy idle animation STILL isn't fixed as of Nov 28th.<br /><br />AND it doesn't follow you when you're on a flying mount (it merely vanishes as it's desummoned). Quite a number of other flying pets follow when on a flying mount (one of my favourite joys is having my sprite darter hatchling out on my druid while I'm in flight form!). IDK I was really hoping to have this pet following me around with my bee-themed hunter when the bee mount finally makes its debut. But the jittering animation is awful and having it constantly disappearing on me upon mounting up makes it less fun. (To my knowledge none of the other bee battle pets follow in flight either, they are all firmly grounded.)<br /><br />I could use an addon to force-summon each time, &amp; the mage disc toy to ensure it flies, but that all kind of misses the whole point! For the effort put into obtaining this pet it's really kind of disappointing right now.<br /><br />(Also for the record I too find it weird it turns into a black bee since the bee we help heal up during the quest dailies is a traditional black-and-yellow honey bee. I LIKE the black bee skin--but it was definitely a discrepancy to go from what we see during the quests to the end result when learned.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>meganerd18</b></h3>So Blizzard is implementing a mount that requires a rep grind, and it's gated by an ultra-rare drop? The bee mount they've been teasing for months, gave as an example of something to offset the poor rep faction mounts the Alliance got, and are promoting like crazy as an 8.2.5 thing. But unless you farm your ass off forever to get this companion, this much promoted mount might as well not exist.<br /><br />Blizzard, baby, I love ya, but stuff like this needs to stop. Overfocusing on rare drops, especially when there's also another huge time sink behind the rare gate.</div>

Take that back to the Hive Mother and feed her. VOILA access to the cave.<br />Step 8: Head into the cave with Barry.<br />Step 9: Listen to Barry cause he gives you a Thin jelly to feed the GRUB in the Honey Comb. DO THAT<br />Step 10: Barry leaves the cave and you are now free to hunt the Jelly deposits all over Stormsong Valley.<br /><br />Side Note. Thin jelly=20 rep, combining the jellies to Blue or Royal is the same rep x 4 or X 8 so save time and just upgrade the jellies instead of turning in 1 at a time.<br /><br />Rep can also be obtained from killing the smasher once a day &amp; doing the sunny grass events, remember to stay all the way til the end a jelly deposit can spawn or you can get a quest item for 750 rep.<br /><br />Side Note: At honored I started getting Rich jelly from Jelly Deposits and at Revered I started to get Royal Jelly drops in addition to Rich jelly from Jelly deposits which made rep gain go faster.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>injunuity</b></h3>just an FYI, if you have this in your pets, check your achievements too, and search for Let's bee friends. if it has a completion date but shows 0/7 progress. don't worry about doing the annealed amulet. you can, but you won't be able to feed Bumbles again, so it'll just waste your time doing this step. <br /><br />if you don't have the achievement, than yes, farm the annealed amulet and feed Bumbles. you can farm for 1 Mildenhall Growth Formula to feed bumbles and than farm for another 8 Vial of Honey Slime to make another MGF, but the game will stop you when you have 8 and not let you pick up more. do this if you have a busy day or 2 ahead and don't have the time to get enough for an MGF.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dulcinia</b></h3>So I'm on my 4th day of dailies and bumbles isn't here to give the formula too. I've tried to contact customer support through in game but am not getting anywhere. I can not turn in the formula to Bumbles if this npc isn't here to do that with. Any suggestions?</div>
