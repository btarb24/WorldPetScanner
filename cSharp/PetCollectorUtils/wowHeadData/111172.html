There are two known spawn points located at:<br />/way Stormheim 47.8 52.4<br /><br />I captured one here both in beta and live, and it was a matter of killing both of the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=59357/bucktooth-flapper">Bucktooth Flappers</a> until you force a spawn.

Fly into Skyfire Triage Camp<br />2. Run down the slope to the stretch of water next to the crashed airship<br />3. At one end of this stretch is a small waterfall and at the other end a cave behind another waterfall<br />4. Run up and down this stretch killing critters. There are two kinds, Bucktooth Flappers and Mud Jumpers.<br />5. There are about five spawn points. You'll learn where they are as you will be here a while. <br />6. Up above the waterfall on your left (as you look down from Skyfire) there is a smaller circular area with a quest mob in the middle. There are a further three spawn points for critters around this circle. <br />7. Keep killing and eventually one of the critters will be replaced by a battle-able beaver.<br />8. Mine appeared at the top of the waterfall.<br />9. I used macros like /target Stormstruck, /target Bucktooth and /target Mud, to help locate the little beasts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kopuliak</b></h3>got mine on 35.81 51.37, NO RAIN on that place, only a storm far away, but its normal in the Stormheim.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ladinei</b></h3>I went around the 3 small water/lake areas.<br />I just went from place to place, killed the critters. I found a spawn after 15 minutes. Lucky me!<br />It did NOT rain</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Alaurynn</b></h3>As you can see from the comments of others here, myself included, the weather (rain) makes no difference. Many of us caught this pet without a cloud in sight. Just keep killing all the Mud Jumpers and Buck-Toothed Flapper critters you can find around the spawn points on the map, and it will pop for you. Took me about an hour to get one to pop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kittykungirl</b></h3>I spent around one and a half hours, by the little pond and by the crash site, with no luck. Plus, jumping around servers a bit. At the 47,52 pond, one spawned the second it started to rain.<br /><br />Some people get lucky without any, but if you really want to get this pet..rain seems to be your friend. Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SaltLB</b></h3>A great place to farm these is a small lake whose entrance is at 29.29, 43.78. Two <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62992/bucktooth-flapper">bucktooth flappers</a> will spawn here every 5 minutes (provided that you are killing them) and it's also a spot for <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=124104/fjarnskaggl">Fjarnskaggl</a> to spawn. This spot is nice because the spawn points of the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62992/bucktooth-flapper">bucktooth flappers</a> are relatively close to each other and the spot itself is hidden.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>adam86shadow</b></h3>Honestly the fastest and easiest way is to download a server hopper addon, go to the pond at 48.52 and server hop till Beavers are there... Took me 10min max</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sheldorx</b></h3>caught mine after battling two of the other beavers at 51.9.64, not sure if them cords will help, if not then i was at Ashild's Bay in stormhelm</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zuan</b></h3>It only spawns when is raining.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sacelerene</b></h3>I was fishing in the ravine just north of Cullen's Post and one spawned next to me. No rain, no need to kill other battle pets.<br /><br />/way stormheim 42.02 61.08</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bearinashi</b></h3>Not only looks cool but it's name rhymes with Cat Scratch Fever. Not that it matters at all...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cangrejoloco207</b></h3>35.9 / 55.2 Skyfire Triage Camp<br />Just sitting by the lake. 3 minutes work.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>testigueule</b></h3>Twice in a row , i saw 2 of them in the same spot, but when I fight one of them , the other disappear. And it's replaced by <a href="/npc=62992/bucktooth-flapper">Bucktooth Flapper</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>projecteulogy</b></h3>I wonder when Blizzard will realize crappy drop/spawn rates are just frustrating for the majority of their pbase. This is when it turns into a chore rather than something to go &quot;have fun&quot; doing. Finally getting the drop/spawn isn't exciting. At all.<br /><br />Example: 6 years farming Sethekk Halls. If i could dump the mount in boiling oil a long with a few devs, i'd sub for a year.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Silvansaria</b></h3>I settled for a lowly grey - just to get the hit on my Pet Journal because they're so seemingly rare. I flew up and down the riverbanks along the left side of the zone and seeing none - I decided to find and kill every Bucktooth Flapper I saw. After about 15 minutes of doing this a Stormstruck Beaver spawned and I was able to capture it.<br /><br />I think it really just depends on RNG too because I remember in the past when I didn't care I've seen a few up at a time. Just fly around the riverbanks, kill a few flappers and have some patience is all I can really recommend. It won't take that long to get one.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wildkipedia</b></h3>I came here just to say<br />I love this pet description lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ModishVision</b></h3>Caught <a href="/npc=111172/stormstruck-beaver">Stormstruck Beaver</a> today at Weeping Bluffs, flew up and down the stream killing pets for about 10 minutes<br />/way Stormheim 29, 45<br />Best of luck pet collectors!</div>
