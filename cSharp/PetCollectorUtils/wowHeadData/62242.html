<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>computerweekend</b></h3>Took me at least 40 kills to finally find a rare. Your results may vary.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aliandrin</b></h3>These Owl-types are well suited for pet battles because of Predatory Strike, which can easily take (even as a non-supereffective move) an opponent of equal level and quality from half hit points to dead, because it does a ton of damage, and THEN if your opponent is at 25% or less, kills them. It can one-shot non-elite water-types, and even considering your opponent is an elite (you're going for Tamer) this pet is probably the best choice to fight water-using NPC trainers.<br /><br />As of now, the only Owls you can get in rare quality are this Crested Owl, and the 125 pet collector award, Brilliant Kaliri. This may change when the Snowy Owl comes out in (hopefully) December.<br /><br />There are two other Owls, but they only come in uncommon:<br /><br />Hawk Owl<br />Great Horned Owl</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>174287</b></h3>I'm thinking of donating a picture I downloaded from the internet of an ACTUAL Crested Owl. They might notice some features that are absent from their design of the crested owl... for example... the crest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bighand</b></h3>What kind of sorcery is this? No rare after hours of grinding .... damn you blizzard!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aquifel</b></h3>For some reason, as of 5.1, this pet stopped showing up as caught for Kalimdor Safari, even though i do in fact have one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>pmakaro</b></h3>For Horde looking for safe travel right to these owls I would recommend getting <a href="/quest=32326/insertion">Insertion</a>. It is part of the new lore quests in 5.1 down in Krasarang Wilds. The quest opens a portal right to Teldrassil Forrest.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Saronai</b></h3>I needed to retame mine as well (5.1 took credit off Kalimdor Safari). Mine was rare. I was worried, thanks to some comments, that I would need to release my current owl and retame another rare. I decided to tame the first encounter before releasing, just in case. Well, the first encounter was rare anyway and taming it gave me credit. <br /><br />Basically, I didn't need to release my former rare to get credit applied correctly. If you are still having such trouble taming the first encounter for credit, you might need to tame a second rare like I did.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vindictae</b></h3>I'm on my third round of Teldrassil trying to get a rare one...so far no dice.<br />Seems to be extraordinarily rare to find a rare. :)</div>

They're not showing up as secondary pets and I can't find a damn one of them. Just a bunch of damn Moths and Squirrels.<br /><br />Blizzard really pisses me off sometimes with these ridiculous spawn rates and timers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>retromic</b></h3>For people trying to get this battle pet in the newest exp, you have to go back in time before going to teldrassil. <br /><br />I talked to Zidormi, located south of Lor'Danel(Darkshore, Kalimdor). <br />Tried for a good hour to get to teldrassil before someone gave me the tips on going back in time. <br /><br />Thought I'd just blurt it out here, since no one has said anything.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ChefCraizeeMayze</b></h3>Anyone know if this is available in 8.1?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>captainmelwasul</b></h3>Just in case anyone is despairing about catching a rare, they do exist, as I caught a level 2 rare quality this morning after hunting for quite some time. Also, as others have mentioned, make sure you have time-traveled to before Sylvanas blew up the tree, or you obviously can't access Teldrassil or the poor owls she killed there. Think of it as a rescue mission!</div>
