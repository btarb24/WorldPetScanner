This allowed for several people to search in the area with no shortage of them spawning.\r\n\r\n[b]BREEDING ISSUE[\/b]\r\nWithout going into all the details, the basic idea is that all battle pets have two (2) of a possible stat, and are either male or female.\r\n\r\n[i][b]-- I use the \"Battle Pet BreedID\" addon--[\/b][\/i]\r\nB - Balanced\r\nH - Health\r\nP - Power\r\nS - Speed\r\n\r\nSo each pet could be B\/B which is double balanced, or P\/S which is power and speed, etc.\r\n\r\nAfter several attempts I noticed that NONE of the Silithid Hatchling have the \"S\" stat.  We kept going after we got our rares (since the respawn was unbelievably fast) and after 120 plus battle between us we didn't see a single one with the \"S\" stat.  NOT ONE.\r\n\r\nWe went between both spawn areas and battled for more than an hour.  It could have just been luck, but it seems more like an Speed Silithid Hatchling is more rare, than a rare blue one. (we got 6 rares - H\/H and H\/P were the only ones we got).\r\n\r\nSo it seems like the Silithid Hatchling could very well be the \"slowest\" battle pet.

They do last longer than the other weather conditions (snow and the rain) for the other pets. My storm is still going after an hour.\r\n3. The storm is zone wide [u]apart from the approach to the Caverns of Time[\/u], including some distance out front. You can't farm Infinite Whelplings while you wait, as even if there is a storm happening, it can't be seen from that part of the zone. You could fish off the coast or hang out in Gadgetzan though, if that's your thing, or farm some silk \/ mageweave \/ greens from the Ogres.\r\n4. You can't have sound in the background for this one, as the ambience of the storm is no different (or barely different) to the usual ambience.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Fhina</b></h3>A sandstorm has been raging on Thrall and not a single Silithid Hatchling to be found at either location after flying around back and forth, and checking about twenty mins later.....as an aside, it happened to be raining at precisely the same time at Jaguero Island (Baby Ape location - needs to be raining). Wonder if they always happen at the same time?<br /><br />Update: There was a bug with a number of pets not spawning during the weather conditions they required, but they've since been fixed. That both zones had the same weather was apparently a coincidence.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>82728</b></h3>Ok, I feel I have to write this for those claiming it's bugged<br /><br />I was in Tanaris. When the sandstorm started 20 of them spawned at their designated location. (see map above)<br />I killed all 20 of them. Got 2 Greens and others were all poor quality.<br /><br />After I killed those 20, I found only 3 more. (those might have been new spawn or I might have missed them on the first round) And after that they stopped spawning and I haven't seen a single one during the rest of the sandstorm.<br /><br />So if you came during a sandstorm and couldn't find any - someone already cleared them in the first few minutes.<br /><br />-edit-<br />Stayed there for more than 30 mins didn't see any new re-spawns.<br /><br />-edit2-<br />Came back again later. Sandstorm was still raging. No new re-spawns.<br /><br />Based on this, I'll assume they only spawn when the Sandstorm starts and don't re-spawn after.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AzerateAeriePeak</b></h3>Definitely not bugged, just caught one during the sandstorm, first time I actually caught a weather dependent pet ^^</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hashupa</b></h3>Showed up about 5 minutes too late after a sandstorm started. Turns out a single person had cleared every single one of them out... I know this because he was on my faction and was able to tell me, all too smugly I might add.<br /><br />People, please don't be that selfish. I've said it before and I'll say it again, in 5.1 <b>there will be a way to upgrade battle pets!</b> Any time you clear out rare pets like this, you are only hurting someone else's chance at seeing this pet, which isn't fair to anyone. Catch ONE and then go about your own business.<br /><br />EDIT: Finally, after a few weeks of enduring extremely greedy farmers, I came in to the tail end of a hatchling massacre, only to be lucky enough to get an uncommon. On my way out, I saw another one, standing by itself on a hill. You know what I did with it? I left it for the next person who (hopefully) didn't have one yet.<br /><br />Good luck to those who don't have one yet. My advice is remain vigilant and more importantly <b>BE POLITE!</b> No need to harass someone, even if they are emptying the spawns. You're much better off leaving them alone. If it helps, just put them on your ignore list.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Galaxas</b></h3>I would suggest parking your toon at the Gaping Chasm while you watch a movie or do some housework, because once a sand storm starts you immediately get to feast on over 50 of these little buggars just in this spot.<br /><br />I lost count of how many I blew through before finally getting my rare, but it was well over 50. I had all of the spawns at Gaping Chasm cleared out, and then I hearthed to let collectors in trade chat know about the sand storm. I flew over Noxious Lair before hearthing, and there was around 30 there. No one else was in Tanaris at this time.<br /><br />The storm started at about 5:30 est, and it had to of lasted well over an hour. It was about 6:15 when I hearthed.<br /><br />If you're on a busy server, I wouldn't suggest blowing through them like I did, but I spammed general chat before I did this and got no answers, nor did anybody show up. I think I was just in the right place at the right time. Happy Hunting fellow pet collectors! :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>normajt</b></h3>Perhaps a silly question, perhaps not..<br /><br />Do the sandstorms effect the entire map of Tanaris, or so the storms hit areas randomly?<br /><br />In over 5 years of playing never really spent too much time on this map to know the answer myself.<br /><br />Thanks for any answers to come!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wark</b></h3>Keep in mind that the rule of cherrypicking applies to minipet battles as much as it does to things like fishing nodes: <b>if everyone in the zone is only using up one kind of pet battle and leaving the rest, eventually you will run out of that one kind.</b> So if the only people fighting minipets during a sandstorm are all hungrily pouncing the silithids, you're probably going to run out and stay out because all the respawns came back as yet another beetle.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>869144</b></h3>I had a sandstorm today and I spent the whole hour checking both hives without a single Silithid Hatchling spawning at all.<br /><br />I then started a ticket and talked to a GM to check if it was bugged or not. He basically said that the team couldn't work out if it was bugged or not, because some people can catch them just fine and others can't even see any. <br /><br />So if you're one of the unlucky ones (like me), you might want to wait until the next patch or so before attempting to get this pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1046597</b></h3>Your best bet is to be there when the sandstorm starts. Dozens of spawns in each cluster will pop up, but may get quickly farmed; new spawns occur over time if the sandstorm holds, but slowly.<br /><br />Keep in mind that there is not really any sound effects to a sandstorm. You can't simply stay in Tanaris with WoW minimized in the hopes of hearing it; that won't work. I ended up working at my desktop with WoW in a window so that I could keep watching the gameplay screen for the sandstorm to occur. After several days I eventually caught the beginning of a sandstorm, and my Hatchling.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Equeon</b></h3>So I had several alts parked in Tanaris on various servers, and actually stumbled upon a sandstorm on my main. The hatchlings were quickly gobbled up by people passing by, but I managed to snag an uncommon one. However, just about two hours later, another sandstorm occurred on the same server: and no hatchlings spawn. My theory is that the silithid hatchlings will only spawn on the first sandstorm of each day.</div>

Unless it goes a full hour (or more) of nobody capturing them (doubtful). The weather is NOT tied with all zones at the same time, and the pet does not spawn with each local time.<br /><br />I joined with people from other servers to make sure this was the case.<br /><br />GM response:<br /><br />Game Master Glanren here!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>683070</b></h3>Silithid Hatchlings only spawn during a Sandstorm - checking 3-5 times per day for 14 days I only saw two sandstorms. They affected the entire map.<br /><br />Neither time did I see any hatchlings. They seem to spawn in large quantities at the start of the sandstorm. I did battle about 20 other pets during the sandstorm, but did not notice any spawns during the storm (about an hour). There were at least 3 others camping, who may have taken them before I noticed them though.<br /><br />It seems the best way to search for this pet is to wait patiently for the Sandstorm to start, rather than checking for a Sandstorm and then searching for the pet - by that time they seem to have been farmed out and may not respawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pwuebear</b></h3>I finally logged in to a sandstorm where the silithids were up. The noticeable difference from previous sandstorms with no silithids up, at least to my recollection, is that the sandstorm has more prominent sand particles where the others I have experienced had virtually none, only clouds of dust. If these are tied together in any way I am not sure, as I have only seen the silithids up this once. If I come across another incident I will be sure to note it.</div>

They are accumulating data and should forward to Developers for a possible hotfix or for the next patch.

Quickly logged back in to find a green paw waiting below me in the Gaping Chasm.<br />Keep in mind this area was heavily camped. In fact the one I found was right below two people. Either they were AFK or could not see it, I don't know.

The other 2 on my map despawned at the same time. I spoke with another player in the area searching who had the exact same experience.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Starchy</b></h3>Took me about two weeks of camping on 4 toons across 4 servers in order to get this little guy.From what I've gathered:<br /><br />1.

They do not respawn during the duration of the storm (others mentioned they do very slowly, but I've sat through an hour/two-hour storm with no greens paws).<br />3. You HAVE to be there at the start of the storm since only a few spawn at the start. <a href="https://twitter.com/Vaeflare/status/276871212754411520" rel="nofollow">Vaeflare (D3 community manager) also mentioned this to me on Twitter.</a><br /><br /> I decided to stay on just a few minutes longer while I went to get ready for bed with no storm up - came back 5 minutes later with a storm and 3 green paws on my map (I was at Gaping Chasm).

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>954889</b></h3>I have been camping Tanaris since Tuesday maintenance, and finally a Sandstorm hit today around 3pm server.<br /><br />As soon as the storm hit, a lot of Hatchlings had spawned, and they were respawning within a minute or two of being cleared, fast enough to where the 5 people I talked to were able to get a rare. They were respawning like that for the half hour I had staid out there, so I am guessing with 5.1 they will continue to do so for the entire duration of sandstorm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jolni</b></h3>I can also confirm these now continue to spawn during the sandstorm, it was early Sunday morning and no one else was around, so I was able to continue to farm these until I had 3 rare's and pick the best, I also got a rare stinkbug, sand kitten and gold beetle so the second pets are not just filler trash.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bengarion</b></h3>They Changed Da Rules!<br /><br />Good news and bad news.<br /><br />1) The good news. The Silithid Hatchlings evidently have been put on &quot;respawn&quot; so there will be an abundant supply for all. At least as long as the sand storm rages on. There were about four of us gathering the pets and they kept on spawning. They were even spawning behind me after I had finished a battle. Yea spawns! (We were battling the hatchlings for about an hour and the supply never stopped.)<br /><br />2) Now the bad news. Evidently the &quot;<b>Alt-F4</b>&quot; trick no longer works. If you do the Alt-F4 to quit the battle and log back in the pet you were battling is, gasp, <b>GONE!</b> So, now when you start a battle, you may as well finish it. I tried the Alt-F4 initially on the Silithid Hatchlings to &quot;be polite&quot; and save it for someone else. None were there when I logged back on. I went outside the area and did the Alt-F4 with other pets in Tanaris and the result was the same. After an Alt-F4 the pet was gone. No more saving the pet for others or regrouping if the battle starts to sour and you want to start over.<br /><br />If your experience differs please comment. I just hope I'm very, very wrong on #2.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1067845</b></h3>Finally got mine on Aggramar after camping for about 3 hours for a sandstorm. The storm started around 2:58 server time, and i was going to wait it out to see how long the storm actually lasts, but it went on for over an hour and i finally gave up (I had other stuff to do). <br /><br />First one i got was an uncommon quality. Then I went through about 10 more and finally got a rare. I realize that I could've used a battle stone, but i did witness that they DO in fact respawn after about a minute, so no worries...there were plenty to go around.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Znaleziatko</b></h3>I checked the pet in here and was scared that I'm never gonna catch it. Then I went to The Noxious Lair and.. there was <b>plenty</b>, just hanging around. I fought seven hatchlings - three of which were <b>rare</b> quality. I just flew around and there's still at least ten of them there. And it doesn't look like a sandstorm to me (but I'm not sure what it's supposed to be like).<br />Sorry for those who spent hours hunting that one but maybe my luck will be helpful to someone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>m4zurka</b></h3>they seem to keep spawning rapidly while there's a sandstorm going on. 9pm on a friday night i was flying around inside the caverns looking for an infinite whelpling and saw a sandstorm start (you can see sandstorms in the center of the caverns where zaladormu is). i flew straight to the gaping chasm and saw a hatchling right away. it was common but i captured it just in case. there were a few other people battling in the area too and it was a little cut-throat trying to be the first to enter the battles :) but there were plenty of hatchlings to go around. maybe entered about a dozen battles before getting a rare, and others were reporting in chat about finding their rares too.<br /><br />happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>536000</b></h3>Sandstorm started today, and a friend whispered me as soon as it started happening. Immediately I logged over and began my search for a rare. To say they are &quot;less elusive&quot; is an understatement.<br /><br />A friend and I began finding that they &quot;re-spawn&quot; about 90 seconds after we left the battle. This allowed for several people to search in the area with no shortage of them spawning.<br /><br /><b>BREEDING ISSUE</b><br />Without going into all the details, the basic idea is that all battle pets have two (2) of a possible stat, and are either male or female.<br /><br /><i><b>-- I use the &quot;Battle Pet BreedID&quot; addon--</b></i><br />B - Balanced<br />H - Health<br />P - Power<br />S - Speed<br /><br />So each pet could be B/B which is double balanced, or P/S which is power and speed, etc.<br /><br />After several attempts I noticed that NONE of the Silithid Hatchling have the &quot;S&quot; stat. We kept going after we got our rares (since the respawn was unbelievably fast) and after 120 plus battle between us we didn't see a single one with the &quot;S&quot; stat. NOT ONE.<br /><br />We went between both spawn areas and battled for more than an hour. It could have just been luck, but it seems more like an Speed Silithid Hatchling is more rare, than a rare blue one. (we got 6 rares - H/H and H/P were the only ones we got).<br /><br />So it seems like the Silithid Hatchling could very well be the &quot;slowest&quot; battle pet. (insert joke here).<br /><br />If you do have a &quot;S&quot; pet - would love to know the stats and the other stat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>694270</b></h3>I would definitely recommend parking an alt in the area. I have had mine there and logged on her every time I would get on to play to check. In about 2 weeks I didn't see a single sandstorm, and most days I would check every few hours or so. This morning I logged on and there they were! I almost logged off because I didn't see them in my minimap immediately. Caught one, flew around looking for a rare since no one else were around. They respawned quickly. Only thing is I saw WAY too many poor quality. I guess it's to be expected but I've never engaged so many pets before seeing a single one of higher than poor quality. Once I noticed a few others doing the same I went ahead and left the area. I also recommend checking for the other weather dependent pets if you find these. I finally found a snowstorm with Arctic Fox Kits in The Storm Peaks. It may be totally unrelated but oh well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Velanthia</b></h3>Sandstorm started just before midnight server time for me. I was very happy since I'd just been sitting there waiting for several hours lol. Anyway, had to go through a LOT of commons and a poor or two before I finally found an uncommon... decided to keep trying for a rare and finally got one. I highly recommend that you keep trying for a rare as long as they're spawned. You don't want to have to come back later to replace your common with a rare lol.<br /><br />EDIT: Forgot to mention I was in the &quot;Noxious Lair&quot; area, which is the NW patch of dots on the map here.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LionsMike</b></h3>A few WORDS of CAUTION<br /><br />I have been watching for the sandstorms for some time and had never seen any until today when I was on my way from the caverns of time to Feralas and noticed the swirling sand (my graphics generaly take a few seconds of standing still to see weather) and I took a hard left and went to the Noxious Lair. As I approached I saw several pet battle icons on my minimap. I went down and clicked on the first one which turned out to be a poor quality but rather than cancel the battle , I captured it. When the battle ended, there were Icons all around me which disappeared within a second or two as the sand storm ended.<br /><br />If you come into Tanaris while the sand is blowing go fast and grab the first hatchling you see. If I had canceled and went for a higher quality I would still need that one for the acheivement.</div>

There was about 20 b/b rares and few h/b rares. Good thing about sandstorm is if you in need of any other tanaris pet - you will find them as secondary. I got my sand kitty, stinkbug and gold beetle, all rares... Pretty happy :O</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jeromic</b></h3>When thier is a sandstorm is it at both spots at the same time or are they seperate and at different times? i have been camping and waiting for the storm for about a week and haven't seen one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nihilistzsche</b></h3>The other day I had been hunting a <a href="/npc=62258/silithid-hatchling">Silithid Hatchling</a> so I could complete my Tanaris collection, and around 2 pm I was feeling a bit hungry. My warlock was in Halfhill at the time, while my girlfriend, who was out at the time, had left her priest in Gadgetzan. I had walked back to check something when I noticed there was a sandstorm on her screen! Excited, I ran to my computer, hearthed to Two Moons, portaled to Dalaran, portaled to the Caverns of Time, and found an uncommon <a href="/npc=62258/silithid-hatchling">Silithid Hatchling</a>. Before the battle had ended, the sandstorm itself had ended. It seems the sandstorm had only lasted around 5 minutes, and if I had noticed it 30 seconds later I would have missed my hatchling. They happen very quick and can happen at any time so just be prepared.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SFFCorgi</b></h3>Finally caught a sandstorm in Tanaris, and promptly started going through Silithid Hatchlings. Here's what I thought particularly interesting -- this is the only time and place, after handfuls of battles, that I have even seen a Rare Desert Spider or Sand Kitten -- secondaries on two different battles. Nabbed them both, of course. This was over in the Noxious Lair.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>998432</b></h3>If you're looking for a specific breed of rare like I was you're bound to be here a while.<br /><br />I would simply start battles, sometimes forfeit, kill the undesirable ones and any rares of the wrong breed I'd leave alive and mark so I wouldn't come back to it. Doing this I apparently managed to help a couple people get a rare Silithid. And they had a good respawn time, so killing them wasn't a travesty.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tale</b></h3>Note that not only does a sandstorm happen throughout the entire zone (rather than just in some subzone, like how the weather on Jaguero Isle is different from the rest of the Cape of Stranglethorn), it even happens all the way down in the bottom of the Caverns of Time. So if you're camping an alt down there to occasionally check on <a href="/npc=68820/infinite-whelpling">Infinite Whelpling</a>, you don't have to worry about possibly missing up a sandstorm up on the surface.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rj23</b></h3>If you are pet collector you will appreciate this, but probably hate me for it. In my quest to capture rare pets a friend of mine began casing Jaguero Isle waiting for rain. We were in separate realms. She left a toon here and I left a toon here. Periodically we would check in and over the course of a couple of weeks she caught hers and I was offline :( We both kept a toon in hopes of rain. Finally the rain came! Not only did I catch my Baby Ape, but I caught a rare before the rain stopped.<br /><br />Earlier she and I discussed some strategies for catching the Minifernal. I said, let me just go see if there is one there now. So I flew to Felwood. There were two in the area! I caught one that was uncommon. The other was poor, but it was still a Minifernal! So I cross realmed party with her and she caught it. To be clear there were none in her realm and she crossed to mine to catch it.<br /><br />With this streak going I decided to look and see if there was a sand storm brewing in Tanaris. There wasn't in my realm, but in my friends realm there was. So we partied again and I crossed into her realm. I was able to catch a rare Silithid Hatchling. From beginning to end it took less than an hour. I am a very unlucky person, but i have to say this was some serious luck! I still cannot believe this happened!<br /><br />If someone can teach me how to link in WoWhead I will go back and amend this story with links to each pet.</div>

If you plan to camp this pet, it would be best that you not alt-tab for too long or do what you're doing in a overlapping window so you can still see wow. Minecraft is perfect for this btw...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tempovision</b></h3>Best strategy for this pet is said many times now. Like all weather based pets, just put an alt on the spot, and check every time you log into wow or change to another char or log out. Just check your tanaris char regularly. I did this for two weeks before I got my hatchling. I was lucky on the other pets : the snow appeared the second day I checked and I had rain after five minutes the first time I was there.<br />I was in no rush at all, I still need the summer pet, so I had 4 months to see the sandstorm. And it only took me two weeks of regularly checking.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Silvansaria</b></h3>For weather dependent battle pets - it's best to either camp your guy (or girl) there and do something in the background or camp a character there and just log in periodically to see what's happening.<br /><br />But for me - I like to do everything with my main so I just do something else while having the speakers all jacked up to hear when the storm hits.<br /><br />Today was one such time.<br />I'm still looking for a rare (I got a green) and the storm is still raging. Seems to last a lot longer than the rain storm for the baby ape. Keep in mind there are also a few other battle pets that come with them as secondaries. I got a rare Sand Kitten during one of the fights and an uncommon Stink Bug (which I'll just stone later).<br /><br />These also have a really fast respawn rate - so if looking for a rare - it's in your best interest to kill the ones you don't want while you do your circuit. For consideration of others you might not want to do that - but I don't consider others soooo... I'm HORDE - I take what I want and leave nothing for the rest...<br /><br />That is all.</div>

I've been waiting for a sandstorm hours at a time since November 2016 when I started collecting battle pets (because one girl was bragging that she had more than I did, in 2 days that was fixed). Last night I spent maybe 7 hours afking in Tanaris and no sandstorm. Went to sleep, woke up, went to the store, came home, logged in in Tanaris and oh my GAWD a sandstorm! I battled the first silithid hatchling that I saw, it was just common but I don't care, I'll just use a stone to make it rare if I ever want to use it. When the battle was over the sandstorm ended. I can't believe my luck right now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pixiwix</b></h3>I had been checking in a few times a week over the last year hoping to catch a sandstorm (and this pet). Finally decided to level up an alt and a sandstorm kicked up while I was questing. Almost didn't realize what it was until I saw the green battle pet icon because I didn't think I'd ever actually catch one!<br /><br />So my tip: if you've been wanting to level up an alt AND you need this or other low-level quests/achieves/mounts/items, might as well kill two birds...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sluggy108</b></h3>I got tired of logging into alts so I decided to put my foot down and wait until it would show up. Very luckily, a sandstorm appeared after only 2 hours of waiting. The sandstorm darkens the sky and it produces a lot of grey puffs of wind. I parked my character in the pit and opened a custom group to let anyone in who wanted to catch this pet. It turns out, the sandstorm lasted very long, which were 2.5 to 3 hours. I didn't stick around to see how long the pets would remain after it ended, but judging from my guildies report they weren't found beyond 15 minutes. Thus, I recommend to check every 2 hours or less if you want this pet. I just set my hearthstone there because there was an amazingly convenient innkeeper right next to the flight master near The Gaping Chasm (bottom right spawn area).</div>

Going to look at the Qiraj Guardling now to finish out Kalimdor Safari! I been leveling my starter pets here for a few months...since the portal to Time Cavern from Dalaran.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lightdrawn</b></h3>I'm trying to catch this elusive pet for more than 2 weeks now, I check at least once daily, but I found not a single sandstorm (equal problem with Arctic Fox Kit, no snow at all). I'm so frustrated by now, those two are the last missing species from the two achievements for me. Can maybe anyone confirm they are still spawning in BfA?<br /><br />Edit: They are still spawning! The best advise I found here was to place alts in the two locations and just log in randomly, instead of traveling there with my mage. Thx</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>projecteulogy</b></h3>Been camping Tanaris since WOD for this pet. Its the only one i'm missing. I know because My mage is stuck at level 100 because she's my camper toon. Every day, 10-15 times a day i'll switch and see if there's a sandstorm. Nope. Cross realming doesn't help. My friend made Trial alts on multiple different servers not in our main's cluster. Nothing. Not even a trickle of a sandstorm. What gives? Is this bugged?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Targulon</b></h3>after month of parking a toon there and never seeing a sandstorm - today it finaly spawned<br /><br /> - a happy 'Zookeeper' -</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aevintiri</b></h3>A Sandstorm started around 11:20 PM EST after camping for almost 12 hours and ended at 11:50 PM EST. <b>I want to confirm that the ENTIRE zone of Tanaris does turn into a sandstorm and not just the two areas where <a href="/npc=62258/silithid-hatchling">Silithid Hatchling</a> spawns.</b> There were tons of <a href="/npc=62258/silithid-hatchling">Silithid Hatchling</a> spawns at both <b>The Gaping Chasm</b> and <b>The Noxious Lair</b> areas. After around 8 battles, I got 1 Rare, 3 Uncommon, and 4 Common. There are only three different breeds for <a href="/npc=62258/silithid-hatchling">Silithid Hatchling</a> and they are B/B, H/P, H/H and I managed to grab one of each. A <a href="/npc=62257/sand-kitten">Sand Kitten</a> (S/S) also spawned as a secondary.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Neon351</b></h3>Caught it today at 21:00 pm got the achievement and then went to eastern kingdoms to try my luck and boom, baby ape was up also!<br />So I suggest to check for the other &quot;hard to find&quot; pets whenever one of them spawns, you might get lucky. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Xaciia</b></h3>Today, in less than 2 minutes, I was finally able to attain my Zookeeper title with the long-awaited capture of this elusive pet. I have been camping for about 4 days, from ~4pm to midnight, realm time, while semi-afk studying. I gained my Pandaria Safari 2/13/16 and this has been the LAST PET for both my Kalimdor Safari and my World Safari achieves. I have checked the craters THOUSANDS of times over the years and never saw the pet, or the sandstorm (including today). <br /><br />Today, I logged in (~4:30 pm) at the south rim of the Gaping Chasm with the intent of &quot;just standing there&quot; like I have for hours over the last few days...but for some reason decided to take a flight around, just in case. As soon as I hit the air over the crater, the first green paw appeared. There were two within a few yards of each other. I didn't bother to look for more, tbh, because I was just so excited my wait was finally over. He's only common quality, HH, but I'm just going to stone him to rare and go on with my life!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mermel</b></h3>Been checking in throughout the day for weeks and nothing but clear skies. How can I get a sandstorm to happen?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Chrysippus</b></h3>Just got mine on 11/13/2021 and it took about ten minutes. <br /><u><b>*NOTE: Sandstorms are zone-wide* </b></u><br /><b>(Battle Pet Breed ID addon is highly recommended if you care about pet stats, PetTracker and ReMatch are also extremely helpful)<u></u></b><br /><br /><u>Simple method to avoid hours of waiting for a sandstorm:</u><br /><br /><ol><li>Make a class trial (druid is recommended) on a realm in a different server group than your own (if you are in a normal realm, try an RP, new player, low pop, etc.)</li><li>Login to class trial, disable non-pet battle addons and reload UI</li><li>Open your bag and use the hearthstone (this should take you to your capital city)</li><li>Open your spellbook and put druid flight form (or flying mount) on your bar</li><li>Turn WM on</li><li>Take the portal to Caverns of Time</li><li>Fly a little into Tanaris from Caverns of Time (make sure you go over the little mountain, <b>your minimap in the top right should say Tanaris, NOT Caverns of Time</b>)</li></ol><br /><br /><ul><li>If you see a black sky and gritty particle effects in the air, then congratulations! You have found a sandstorm in Tanaris and Silithid Hatchlings should be spawning at the two hives.</li><li><br />If the zone is bright with clear skies, then proceed to next step</li></ul><br /><br />-<br /><br /><ol><li>Fly back to Caverns of Time</li><li>Take the portal back to your capital city</li><li>Step in the city just enough to see NPCs / players phase in or out when you turn off warmode (<b>This is important to be sure you actually switched shards</b>)</li><li>Turn off warmode, </li></ol><br /><br /><ul><li>If you see NPCs / players phase out, then phase back in, you have successfully switched shards</li><li><br />If you don't see NPCs / players phase out and back in, then toggle warmode again, make sure warmode is turned off and you have phased into a different shard</li></ul><br /><br />-<br /><br /><b><u>Go back through the Caverns of Time portal, then repeat earlier steps and fly into Tanaris</u></b><br /><br /><ul><li>If you see black skies / gritty particle effects, then congratulations on finding a sandstorm!</li><li><br />If clear skies, then repeat this process, i.e. make another class trial on a different server group</li></ul><br /><br />-<br /><br />Admittedly, I got very lucky and found a sandstorm on my second class trial with WM still on. This method should, in most cases, still be significantly faster than waiting in Tanaris for a sandstorm to hit on your shard. This method is repeatable and you can just delete class trials when you are done or if you run out of class trial slots. <br /><br />Good luck on your Silithid Hatchling hunt!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>stevemacky</b></h3>Don't know if this will help anyone, but Tanaris just had a sand storm at 7:30pm PST Nov 13, 2021 on Malfurion US. Collected my pet. Thank goodness that's done.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>wohin</b></h3>Some observations:<br /><br />1. I camped this zone on two servers for 8+ hours before a storm spawned. If you periodically check for storms on a single toon you're kind of throwing a dart blind and hoping to hit the bulls eye.<br />2. They do last longer than the other weather conditions (snow and the rain) for the other pets. My storm is still going after an hour.<br />3. The storm is zone wide <u>apart from the approach to the Caverns of Time</u>, including some distance out front. You can't farm Infinite Whelplings while you wait, as even if there is a storm happening, it can't be seen from that part of the zone. You could fish off the coast or hang out in Gadgetzan though, if that's your thing, or farm some silk / mageweave / greens from the Ogres.<br />4. You can't have sound in the background for this one, as the ambience of the storm is no different (or barely different) to the usual ambience. I did a side by side comparison and couldn't tell.<br /><br />My recommendation? Do an admin / study / whatever blitz and ALT-TAB througout the day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Highstakes</b></h3>A sandstorm happened today on Sunday 31st of July @10:25GMT. I'd been camping this Pet for a week maybe 10 days, solidly, and was starting to question if it was a phasing issue, game bug, and all the rest.<br /><br />Logged into my collector alt who was parked at The Gaping Chasm. and the Sky just didn't look like anything I'd seen before in that zone, it was incredibly cloudy with no visibility of the sun. After about 30 minutes the sky went even darker, the Field of view was reduced and there were large gusts all over the place - very distinct you'd know if it happened. <br /><br />Just got to get lucky. Stay strong my fellow collectors!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Laderoth</b></h3>Sandstorm was up today when I logged in on US Dalaran at 12:20pm. I had only been checking for a sandstorm for 4 days so I guess I am very lucky. I also found the Baby Ape and Arctic Fox Kit, all within 4 days of parking toons there to check, so maybe the odds of these weather effects occurring has increased!</div>

After two days of switching in between realms every few hours - I actually caught the pet. <br />Tip: 1) Do not check the sky to see a huge sandstorm. It was barely any storm (if any storm) at the spawn point. I checked the minimap - noticed the green paw (pet) icon and voila - it was all around the place. As somebody else mentioned - the storm does not (always) cover the whole zone it seems.<br /><br />Thank you wowhead! The best page for a smooth WoW experience (:</div>

By the time, I'm writing this post (10:47am) the sandstorm has stopped.<br />Before this, I'd been checking hourly between 17:00-00:00 and had no luck - I think sandstorms are definitely in the morning in this realm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Elvenwarrior2001</b></h3>Been doing this off and on for about a week. I've been leaving it open a few hours a day while I do documentation for work. I also run a Starter Account while playing on my main account on the same server and check it every 30 minutes or so. It does indeed seem to be very rare and random. Based on past comments it seems checking at least every 2 hours is ideal if possible as some reported sandstorms running for about 2 hours. If I find one I'll try and confirm the length and get a screenshot since some people seem to have questions about how they look on different graphic settings.</div>
