There was one in front of the cave passageway, 3 more in the passage (between the small cave and the big one) and 4 more inside. No rare yet, but I will come later. They don't seem to be farmed since most of other pets in my battlegroup are constantly being camped all over (damn you CRZ!).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1059984</b></h3>Let's just confirm they'll spawn on top of a yeti's spawn point after you kill the yeti. They don't spawn with a yeti, and may spawn instead of a yeti, either way had the pet pop up that way..<br /><br />Just don't accidentally kill it like I did because you had a lvl 22 pet fighting it.....<br />Got my second one outside of the cave this time between the cave and the tunnel.<br />Just keep killing yetis, it'll spawn.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1060158</b></h3>Thanks for all the posts. I went to the cave after reading that some of you killed mobs to get one to spawn. I killed about 4 or 5 mobs and ran to the opening between the first and second cave. Immediately one spawned and it was my lucky day! It was a rare! <br /><br />Thanks for your tips, I don't know if killing made it spawn, or if I was just lucky lucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>owlloveyou</b></h3>I caught a poor and battled a second poor at 2:20 am and 2:22 am in the back of the cave. I didn't kill any yeti though there was an ally killing them when I got there. Both time the Stunted Yeti was standing with a larger one. Welcome pet number 440 :) It's super cute and good luck to all going for it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>37633</b></h3>Not sure if it was mentioned yet or not but you can not see them by flying over the cave. I just got one today there was none on the map until I was in the main part of the cave. There was a ton up so after catching mine I doubled checked to see. <br /><br />They do not show up while flying over the cave.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bunnyoverlord</b></h3>Spent over an hour camping for this pet. I lost track of how many murder circuits I did of both caves, the &quot;courtyard&quot; of sorts between them, and the yetis outside. Hell, I even got <a href="/npc=5346/bloodroar-the-stalker">Bloodroar the Stalker</a> to spawn a couple of times. Finally, one popped outside of the cave. It was not &quot;on top of a yeti's spawn point&quot; as has been suggested here other times. They are <b>not</b> linked to killing the yetis, although it's a good way to pass the time and keep yourself from getting too terribly bored while you wait.<br /><br />Out of curiosity I went back into the caves to see if any others had popped with the one outside. Nothing.<br /><br />Please do not look for this pet expecting a 10-minute spawn timer and guaranteed plentiful spawns, or think that there's anything you can do to &quot;force&quot; them to pop. Like so many other things in the game, it's simply a matter of luck. But it's definitely far less painful to get than the <a href="/npc=62854/scourged-whelpling">Scourged Whelpling</a>!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ArowynRaynn</b></h3>Got my Rare Stunted Yeti after ten minutes of being inside the caves. Thanks for the tip of going in and not flying over it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sengenjin</b></h3>Thunderhorn - EU. Sunday 16/12/12. 3:45 am (UK) 4:45 (Server).<br /><br />Had my Druid stationed outside for regular checks. At this point in time the cave was crawling with them. I'd honestly estimate that there were 'almost' as many Pet Yeti as there were mob ones.<br /><br />Stealthed in and got one green followed by a half dozen or so grey/white before hitting on a blue. Caught it and hearthed back to SW. Put a call out in Trade channel to alert anyone else who may have been hunting for one.<br /><br />Even had time to log into my wife's account, boat from SW to Teldrasil, fly down and it was still crawling. Cat-stealthed in again, no green this time but it only took a handful of grey/white before the blue arrived.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone else in their hunting :)<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>707192</b></h3>I tried using the NPCScan to find these guys but as soon as I logged in at the cave, the NPC Scan went off but there were none in nor around the cave so I dont think it works for this particular NPC. I tried a second time after clearing my cache and the same thing happened.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Quelxes</b></h3>What I found with this one, like with all others pets, it is easy to speed spawn by killing other pets (critters) in the area. <br /><br />I logged in today morning and it was not there. I created myself a macro:<br /><br />\tar rabbit<br />\tar snake<br />\tar squirrel<br />\tar stunted yeti<br /><br />and flew around the area killing all the critters i could target in the area. After killing around 6-7 I went to check for yeti and one popped up. Started the fight but I got disconnected during the fight. Logged in again and no yetis available. A quick critters killing again an one popped up again. This time I got it<br /><br />Hope it helps you all finding it. With that method you can save a lot of time on different, hard to find pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>m4zurka</b></h3>the first day i tried for this one i ran around for a while and didn't see a single one. this time (friday 9:45pm) i found three right away: one outside the main entrance near the tower of estulan, one in the grassy area in between the caves, and one in the second set of caves. two commons and a poor.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Phoneutria</b></h3>It's great pet because of Haymaker, it hits a lot, but you'd better have also pet with Arcane Storm to avoid stun when it fails to hit.<br /><br />Does yeti with higher speed as attack power exist?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>764992</b></h3>Try this. I killed every Feral Scar Yeti outside the main entrance, thru the tunnel, and in the clearing before the main cave. Keep killing them as they respawn. I was able to force a stunted yeti to spawn outside the main entrance <i>exactly</i> every 10 minutes. Got my rare within one hour of arriving.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>altheman</b></h3>So strange. I accidently ran into one on my level 30 horde. Just caught and ran off with it! :)<br /><br />Never knew it was a rare find!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>795337</b></h3>I guess I got lucky for a change, flew by there and right at the mouth of the cave was a baby yeti just waiting to be caught! Only an uncommon, but hey, I didn't have to wait around or kill a million things to get him to spawn. <br />Now if only the Minfernal were so easy :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gealex</b></h3>Just go inside the cave, walk around, you will find these guys in there. There are some outside the cave, but not as many. In roughly 20 minutes of scouting around and fighting them I managed to find a blue one and capture it.<br />Also got a blue snake pet, so it was well worth the time spent considering the additions to my pet collection.<br /><br />They are fairly frequent, though not as many as more common pets from the critter or aquatic classes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gardenbearz</b></h3>I killed a ton of these in pet battles over several days of hanging out the the yeti caves for an hour or two at a time before finding a rare. One thing I noticed is that the other ones I battled, poor through uncommon quality, were all level 12 and the rare I found was level 11. No idea if that means anything really but hope it helps. GL2U all =^.^=</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aranyszin</b></h3>One thing I noticed - if you are outside the cave, your minimap may not pick up specimens inside the cave. I saw one outside, but as soon as I entered the cave, it was full of them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kaz17</b></h3>Can confirm Quelxes report that killing critters is the way to get your Stunted Yeti. Used his macro and Killed around 8 critters near the Feral Scar Vale and threw in a pet battle for good luck and the yeti had spawned every time.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>d0ttie308</b></h3>I saw the green grayed out Paw from Flying over the Feral Scar Vale 52,59. The Stunted Yeti was inside the cave unfortunately he was gray.<br /><br />UPDATE: I had a toon sit for hours where they spawn, around Dailies server reset time I checked there were over 20 Stunted Yeti after 10 fights got my rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Karbo</b></h3>I captured a poor then kept looking. After a few tries I found an uncommon and capped him. The next one was also an uncommon after I had one in my journal already. The next one after that was the rare so it seems I worked my way up. Not sure if it's supposed to work that way but it worked for me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>555434</b></h3>I had left my mage in the Feral Scar Cave yesterday, and when I logged in today, there were eight Stunted Yetis out and about.<br />I fought all of them, only to come across<br />- 6 Poor quality yetis,<br />- 1 Common quality yeti<br />- and 1 Uncommon quality yeti.<br />After I had caught/defeated them all, there were no other spawns and I wasn't going to wait for any more.<br />(I'll probably just slap a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=92682">Flawless Humanoid Battle-Stone</a> or a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=92741">Flawless Battle-Stone</a> on my yeti)<br />Good luck hunting fellow Tamers!</div>

First off you can indeed see the little green paws above the caves. Secondly, I happened to get there when it started raining and they started spawning fast!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>animal446155</b></h3>seems these yeti r on 3hr cooldown found 2 uncommon back 2 back the rare has yet to spawn</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>oliveoyle</b></h3>This seems to be one of those pets that you HAVE to camp (*unless you're very lucky) in order to get one. Yes, when they spawn there are a quite a few, BUT since they seem to have a very very slow respawn timer they're really hard to come by so please be polite and leave some for the rest. I see so many people on here bragging how they camped and battled until they finally got that rare. tsktsk<br /><br />(I waited around for around 3 hours before one finally spawned. I tamed him *white quality* and left.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>aislin2476</b></h3>I had never even heard of this pet. I thought the only Feralas-unique pet was the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62395">Nether Faerie Dragon</a>. There was only one of these guys up, but I fought it on a whim, and my very first one was rare quality! That never happens to me, so I totally did a booty dance in my head.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>geekygirlish</b></h3>Blizz may have fixed this, I did my trainer q, grabbed a faire dragon thingy, and was checking out the area. I either hit the spawn timer right or they've been increased. Flew over the cave area and the place lit up with paws. The cave was packed and they kept respawning. It wasn't raining that I noticed. I didn't find a rare but there were lots of uncommon.<br /><br />I decided to take him for a spin, this guy is a riot! He basically two shotted all the beasts and critters that he came up against. Hits like a tank, so he may be a permanent member of my team. Was gonna find him a stone to upgrade but may not need too! <br /><br />Warning, don't use him to capture a rare, dude doesn't know his own strength! POW!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1474787</b></h3>I just kept initiating pet battles with various Stunted Yeti's in the cave and forfeiting matches with anything less than rare.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>xsirenxcrusnikx</b></h3>The model for this was updated recently, same with <a href="/npc=15699/tranquil-mechanical-yeti">Tranquil Mechanical Yeti</a>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>TheLittlePanda</b></h3>I had to create an account just to comment here....<br /><br />I tried everything. I tried killing the critters in the zone. I tried simply waiting and camping. But, as soon as I killed the yetis in the cave, they started to spawn. <br /><br />Kill the yetis in the Feral Scar and you'll get yours rather quickly. I never found a rare, but then, I have stones to upgrade with so I'm good.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gladly</b></h3>When I arrived in the area most of the yeti mobs there were already dead, as if someone were either questing there or farming for the pet spawns. (I saw one appropriate level player and 2 other high level players roaming the area.) There were three Stunted Yeti spawns up in the Feral Scar Vale, I captured at 53.51, 55.92 at 8:29pm EST/server time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1yayaya1</b></h3>I think either the amount has increased or possibly just not as many players in the area.<br />I can remember waiting hours, looking for rain etc and killing countless Yeti's for this pet to spawn. <br />It was soo hard to get. Today I counted 9 in the cave and 3 outside the cave, no comments since 2018<br />so I'll assume that &quot;Hunted by locals for years, this is an extremely rare specimen&quot; doesn't hold true any longer?<br />Edited to add time seen in case they are still rare: Monday @ 1pm PST</div>
