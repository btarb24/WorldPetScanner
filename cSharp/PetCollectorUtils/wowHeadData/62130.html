Now, since the zone is very camped, maybe I missed the whole pack respawn between the first Calf and the one I actually caught, but it's also possible that the pack itself had an half hour respawn time.

So I have doubt on whether killing the dusthoofs or other beasts around the area would help at all.\n\nA short while after the server came up this week (the server maintenance was expected to end at noon and the server came up at 7:30am instead, I logged on at 8), I went and checked the giraffes and I counted around 5 packs of 2\/3 adults with 1\/2 calves each. I checked each of the spawn and didn't find any rare, left the adults up and went to do dailies. About 2 hours later I came back and all 5 packs were intact and no calves has respawned. (so this time I cleared all of them).\n\nYesterday when I was checking them up I noticed a lone calf wandering at around 50.6,51.2. Since I usually find the gazelles there I was wondering whether those two spawns are related. \nHowever, earlier today I came across with a lone adult with 2 calves, and as soon as I finished checking the calves the adult was killed by one of the lions.  Then A few hours later I found 2 lone calves wandering at the exact same spot. So it is possible that any lone calves you encounter are just the leftovers when their adults have been killed by the lions. (and are mistakened as spawns with Dusthoof Giraffes if they are close by)\n\nEdited: It would seem there the calves can indeed spawn alone without any adult around. I have seen at least 3 spots where they would spawn and only stays at that spot, instead of continuing on the route when the adults they've been accompanying are killed.","date":"2012-11-26T22:37:41-06:00","rating":0,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2012-12-02T22:24:21-06:00",1,"verduran"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":68,"id":1772334,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"942158","body":"So I hate to admit i dedicated 7 hours straight to catching this little giraffe calf.

I took a 2 hour break and didnt even bother with the other battle pets, just running around killing all giraffes and scanning the area. \r\n\r\nIn 7 hours, i came across 6. Honestly not too many people have the patience to farm it. Or atleast the ones i saw stayed and farmed for maybe an hour. A tip: Be wary of using your mechanical animals against the giraffe calf . All the ones i fought were lvl10 and my mechanical is lvl 8, and by the magical forces id crit for 200 and kill it dead. So i got it down to 250 and used my whelpling to finish and trap him.

Dusthoof Giraffes are irrelvant - you may as well ignore them.\n2: Barrens Giraffes are all patrolling spawns. They do not shuffle around a single location, so if you think any mobs are placeholding and they are doing the same-spot shuffle, they are not placeholders.\n3: While it is possible to encounter giraffe calves on their lonesome (or in pairs), without exception when I've seen them they have been walking the same path as one of the adult spawns - presumably mum, dad and strange uncle Jim have been picked off by lions, which for some reason ignore the calves (I've seen them do this - take out the adults and leave the calves).\n4: If you are after a rare (since those stones that Blizz put in to level up pet quality seem impossibly elusive) then you are in this for the long haul. You will see more rare mobs (of the silver dragon type) than you will giraffe calves of any quality.\n\nSo. When you find some Barrens Giraffes, spend some time following them. They always patrol the same routes. Learn the dozen or so routes for the different groups, and you will save yourself a lot of running around - you can cover all the routes in a single circuit of the zone once you know their quirks.\n\nThey appear to be timed spawns. I've not nailed down the precise delay, but it's long. I initially though somewhere between one and two hours, but it ended up being 7 (as per my comment below). I am pretty sure that the calf spawns ae independent from the prarie dogs and adders that litter the zone, so it's probably only worth fighting them to level up your existing pets since clearing them will not spawn more calves.\n\nWhat I don't know is whether calves only spawn when the adults do, or if the adults (if left alone with a DVD and bottle of wine) will produce another one (like the mommy infested bears do over in Hillsbrad, or the Diemetradon hatchlings do in Ungoro). Which means I don't know if it is better to kill the adults to clear the spawn, or leave them to do their thing.

Won't farm that anymore lol, eyes falling out of my head :P\r\n\r\nGood luck, hope that helps.","date":"2012-12-27T00:32:04-06:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":82,"id":1788033,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"1068678","body":"Found and captured a calf at 15.00 server time today.

Note that I say this is a person who at this time has captured (not upgraded with a stone) a rare version of every battle pet except for 5, so by this point I'm fairly well acquainted with the various spawn mechanics of pets.  I only say this because this pet is relatively unique, so I want to give some justification that I'm not just randomly stating what I've observed.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this pet does follow a parent-child mechanic with the adult Giraffes, but it's a unique mechanic.  Every parent-child pet works in the following way: when a mob spawns, it has a chance to be a \"mother\".  If it is a mother spawn, it will spawn a child roughly every 10 minute.  If you kill a non-mother spawn (indicated by not having a child), it has a chance to respawn as a mother or non-mother; but if you kill the mother, it too has a chance to respawn as a mother or non-mother.  Children will follow the mother wherever they go, and if the mother is killed, they will simply despawn after a certain amount of time (roughly 5 minutes).  This of course only applies to the limited number of pets that follow the mother-child relationship.  \r\n\r\nThe Giraffe Calf only follows half of these mechanics.  It will still follow the mother around and will despawn after a certain time if the mother dies.  Even without players killing the mothers, lions occasionally does this, so you sometimes see lone Giraffe Calves near the west gate where lions are common.  However, Giraffe Calves ONLY spawn when the Giraffes themselves spawn; if you attack the pet and do not kill the mother, new Giraffe Calves will not spawn.  The spawn rate of a Giraffe Calf seems to be relatively high per pack; I'm not completely sure yet if every Giraffe Calf in the pack has a chance to spawn a pet, or if the pack as a whole has a chance, but regardless, I'd say at least half the time, the pack will spawn with one or more Calves (I've never seen more than 2, leading me to believe it's a pack-based chance).  \r\n\r\nWhen you see a Giraffe, kill it after pulling any pets; this will allow the Giraffe to respawn.  If you don't kill it, it won't respawn and you won't get new pets.  One note however.  Pet collectors are likely used to killing enough pets in the zone forcing respawns.  The Giraffe mothers do not work like this; they seem to respawn zone-wide at certain intervals as far as I can tell, or at a minimum, it's not a fixed spawn time.  The reason I say this is that many times I killed a Giraffe only to found it had respawned 5 minutes later, and other times it took an hour to spawn.  Either way, for those wondering, I'd say on average it takes about half an hour for the Giraffes to respawn, but this is random, so you shouldn't necessarily set your watch to it.\r\n\r\nLike many Pandaria pets, Giraffes Calves follow \"pack\" rules.  That means that, for example, if you see a pack of Giraffes and there are two Calves, both of the pulls will be identical.  That is, each Calf in the pack will pull as a Calf of the same rarity, the same single secondary pet, and the secondary pet having the same rarity.  Thus, if you're farming rares, you can save a few seconds when you find 2 Calves in a pull by simply killing the other one along with the pack if you've already seen the first one doesn't have a rare; the second one will be the same.\r\n\r\nAn interesting quirk is that a server restart forces all Giraffes to respawn, so the zone becomes flooded with Giraffe Calves.  Unlike [npc=62854 domain=www] and [npc=62317 domain=www], these pets are spread over a large area, so if you're already in Southern Barrens when the restart ends, you should be able to get one before someone can farm all the Calves in the zone (since it will take them a good ten minutes or so to check the whole zone).  An interesting quirk to this; after a server restart, for some reason, the entire set of Calf spawns follows pack rules.  That is, every single Calf in the zone will be an identical pull, a phenomenon I've never noticed (yet) with any other pet.  I've yet to confirm if this same sort of \"zone-wide\" pack respawn can occur other than after a restart; it's hard to tell as if only a few Giraffes respawn at a time, you might see the same primary and secondary spawn, but if they're on other sides of the zone when this happens, it's nearly impossible to tell if this is just luck or an actual mechanic.","date":"2013-03-01T05:05:11-06:00","rating":256,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Upvoted for a very detailed description of the mechanics.

Here is what I have. I initially located a trio of [b]Barrens Giraffes[\/b] patrolling near Bael Modan (around 49.00, 80.00) with a giraffe calf. This was the first calf I had seen after three consecutive hours of killing every type of giraffe, zhevra, plainstrider, lion all over the Southern Barrens map. And the calf was a rare.

At that time, two giraffe calves spawned with [b]DUSTHOOF giraffes[\/b] just outside of the great gate. Both were poor quality. I lost the first battle and the trapped calf was lost (rare emerald boa as the secondary). I captured the second poor quality calf. Now, I stayed just outside of the great gate and saw two more calves spawn within 15 minutes also with Dusthoof giraffes. Both were poor quality. I have since seen multiple Dusthoof Giraffes spawn outside of The Great Gate. I have killed them and seen zhevras and lions spawn in their place. \r\n\r\n[b]As far as my experience they DO spawn with the Dusthoof Giraffes[\/b] but others have claimed that they do not. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps someone.

I'd cycle through each spawn location and check for my rare, kill the calves that weren't rare and all Barrens giraffes, rinse and repeat.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1037290</b></h3>Took me two days to finally get one: 1st attempt, I spent hours searching and then -doh!- lost the battle (just like Vegatifa did). 2nd attempt, after several more hours of flying all over the southern barrens, killing zebras, lions, and regular ol' giraffes, (in the hopes that the re-spawn would be a giraffe calf) I finally found one! I won the battle that time too! I used my lvl 10 singing sunflower, because it's 'lash' spell hardly damages critters; I was able to avoid killing it. However, all that time and effort only to receive a... <b>&quot;poor&quot;</b> rated giraffe calf.... *sob*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>645883</b></h3>I have noticed that the giraffes share spawn points with zhevras. I have not seen them yet share a spawn with plainstriders. I have been camping a few spawn points and it seems to be a %50 chance to get either a zhevra or giraffe. I have seen over 50 giraffe spawns and no calf yet. So if you want to increase the giraffe spawn rate, make sure to be killing zhevras too!<br /><br />3:40am: Just found one! (only common quality and was accompanied by a rare small frog I had to kill &gt;.&gt;) Was not accompanied by any giraffe in the area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>shintorg</b></h3>Spent 2hrs farming a Giraffe spawn. 8 Zhevra and 8 Giraffe. Not a pet spawned with them. I do think the pets can spawn near where a mob could spawn, but they are independent.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>VicarChromaggus</b></h3>After reading the comments above, I started my own experiment.<br /><br />According to my own conclusions of this experiment, there are about 5 giraffe spawns 'safe'.<br />The other 4 spawns will be killed quickly by lions.<br /><br />I focussed purely on killing zhevras, after making sure the 5 'safe' spawns had a giraffe, I finished off the remaining zhevras and moved south towards the razorfen dungeons.<br /><br />Halfway I ran into a herd of barren giraffes with a calf cheerfully jumping towards me.<br /><br />Could be some sort of key sequence to trigger a spawn.<br /><br />Or possibly, when there are more giraffes and less zhevras the barren herd (which is only one herd) will spawn and run north from razorfen..</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>695025</b></h3>After reading various theories, I found that the Giraffe Calf <b>DOES NOT</b> spawn with the Dusthoof Giraffes. Killing them, and any Zhevras or Plainstriders does not work. They spawn with <b>Barrens Giraffes</b>. (And sometimes alone too, but this is NOT tied to the other mobs in the area, except perhaps roaming Gazelles).<br /><br />Try killing any roaming Gazelle (or even lone Gazelles) south of the Overgrowth. A few minutes of killing and waiting for the Gazelle herds to respawn netted me a calf... it was poor quality, but I'll take what I can get for now! lol hopefully one day I can at least find an uncommon one!<br /><br /> I'd like to emphasize that packs of Barrens Giraffes also spawn all over the map... so just do a circuit while you're waiting for the gazelle packs to respawn.<br /><br />TL;DR -- If you find a calf with some Barrens Giraffes (the <i>only</i> &quot;adults&quot; they spawn with), please be sure to kill the adults too to allow others to have a chance!<br /><br />2nd edit: I'm not 100% sure about the Gazelles anymore, but it gives you something to do while waiting! haha :) All I know is when I killed a pair of Gazelles, suddenly I saw a pair of Barrens giraffes go by with a calf, so that's what led me to my &quot;conclusion&quot;. If anyone has information that proves that the Gazelles don't affect the spawn, please feel free to add your dataz!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Praxidice</b></h3>I'd like to add that at the time of writing this, there is a bug regarding battle-pets being viewed while on a taxi. Flying down from Ratchet via gryphon I saw 2 giraffe calves on my minimap. On landing I immediately flew back to where they had been. There were no lions, no other people, indeed no giraffes. There was no time for them to have been scooped up by other players. Reading about other peoples' similar experiences with other rares like Minfernals and the like it appears that this is an unfortunate bug. At the very least some issue with being in a different phase while flying or possibly a different realm. Regardless, I hope it is resolved soon as every time I see these spawns and then find out they're not real, it hurts my heart. X(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SylviaDragon</b></h3>I think I may know how this works now. I spent two or three hours flying in circles and killing the full grown giraffes and found nothing. Then I tried switching to killing the other battle pets. I ran around shooting all the Perry dogs and Adders and almost right away I found three giraffe calfs. (One of which wasnâ€™t even with an adult) Maybe their spawn isnâ€™t related to the adult mobs but connected to the other battle pets in the zone? Has anyone else tried this and had better luck? Could have just been dumb luck but who knows.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1043501</b></h3>These are not as rare as some would like you to believe, Giraffe packs (Barrens Giraffes only) spawn with them at close to 75%, and the giraffes are on a close to 7 min respawn timer.<br /><br />Edit: To be clear, the calves appear to only spawn when the giraffe pack spawns, while there are a few calf spawns that seem to not be tied to a pack, for the others to respawn, you MUST kill the other giraffes next to the calf as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Driva</b></h3>My tip is to go for these after server restart. I found six in the morning after a restart. You can combine it with the <a href="/npc=62201/spawn-of-onyxia">Spawn of Onyxia</a>, which is close by, and also pops up in larger numbers after reset. I'd say begin with the little dragons, since they seem to be more popular.</div>

It was poor quality but Ill wait till the next patch comes out and I can grind for stones to make it rare, it'll sit in my journal till then. Can confirm poor was a lvl9 with about 460ish HP, kept healing itself too so made it tricky to catch. Good luck to everyone searching!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jxnboy007</b></h3>Just caught one of my own! I've been hunting frantically just as much as everyone else with no results. This particular night/morning, I had killed a few mobs and battle pets in the area and had actually left it for a while (2-6 minutes). Upon returning a lone calf was running about and I nearly fell out of my chair! Luckily, I had prepared for a flexible battle as the calf kept healing itself over and over. I knew I had 3 pets vs. 2 so, all I really had to do was hold out while trying to capture and not manage to accidentally kill it; as I have so many other battle pet capture attempts.<br />Here's the info:<br />5:40am Eastern U.S. <br />Tuesday PRE-server maintenance/reset<br />location= 43,55 Southern Barrens<br />Giraffe Calf lvl 9- &quot;common&quot;<br />B/P used: lvl 9 Adder (C), lvl 9 Beetle (U/C), lvl 17 Lil' XT<br /><br />Good Luck!<br /><br />**edit: Worked on this a second time with a friend. Just north of the first spot across the road. It was about 6:30am Eastern U.S. (3:30am server). Worked on killing everything at first. Then I killed a zhevra in the spot until a Duskhoof Giraffe showed up and I left him alone. Cleared off the other battle pets and then kept clearning the lions all around. After this, the little Calf showed up for her. I wonder if it has anything to do with clearing out the lions that normally pounce on the peaceful critters? Once the little calf is safe, he comes running out?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mizz</b></h3>I've caught an uncommon one at 1:00 am (CEST) just outside Fort Triumph. The calf was roaming with a pack of two Barrens Giraffes, I think the pack that travels on the road between Ruins of Turajo and Fort Triumph. On a side note, half hour earlier I saw another Giraffe Calf alongside two Barrens Giraffes, just outside Ruins of Turajo (on the right side of the road), but missed to tag it (my heart broke a little bit). Now, since the zone is very camped, maybe I missed the whole pack respawn between the first Calf and the one I actually caught, but it's also possible that the pack itself had an half hour respawn time. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>209573</b></h3>More (probably pointless) data, but I found one following a pair of Barrens Giraffe just north of Desolation Hold at 42, 66, around 15:25 server time. Got an uncommon out of it, lucky lucky! Will follow them a bit longer to see if another one will spawn, or if they only pop one per &quot;parent&quot; spawn. They're wandering back and forth in that little &quot;strip&quot; of land north of the hold, and not only is it a short path to monitor, the people who are currently camping either side of the rift farther east and south have yet to fly over this spot.<br /><br />As a side note, a couple of days ago I accidentally killed one just west of Bael Modan when one of my pets got a bit overzealous and got off a crit on the last hit I needed to bring it to capturable health. Bad Fossilized Hatchling! I followed the adult giraffe around for a while after that, hoping for another, but gave up after a half an hour. There is an obscenely long respawn rate on these, and, like many posters before me, I really recommend trying for them after server resets. I'm only following them for science and data now; if another spawns I'll leave it for others because I'm awesome like that, since I just captured mine and want to give others a shot at one of their own. :)<br /><br />Edit: Right, I've been following them for over an hour now, and I've got nothing. Can't be arsed to sit here further, off to actually catch something somewhere else. So yes, and ouch, the respawn is bloody well awful on these things. If you actually find one, for the love of the Light, CATCH it, regardless of quality, for you'll not likely get the chance again for a day or two. :-\</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sonjaleigh</b></h3>I decided to set up camp just south of The Overgrowth, killing everything; battle pets, critters, yellows and reds (just in case lol). This was early afternoon on a Sunday. After about an hour, two hours at the most, I came out of a battlegroud and there it was with two Barrens Giraffes walking right by me. I realized then that it will be found with Barrens Giraffes (which are a little bit smaller than the others), and not with the Dusthoof Giraffes. I submitted a screenshot of the map with the pat of the Barrens Giraffes I found. I do not know the specific spawn point, nor any other spawn points for these giraffes. I just thought maybe this would help some of you to have a little more knowledge of a specific spot to look. EDIT: Okay so since my screenshot hasn't been approved, the pat of the Barrens Giraffes I found was pretty much circling the little camp between Vendetta Point and Forward Command.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>solieus</b></h3>If rare battle pets seem like the thing of dreams, like for me, try this:<br /><br />1) Wait for a realm maintenance. Rolling restarts work too, and are easier to use since they're quicker.<br />2) Have 2-3 chars on different realms camping some spawn spots. Having them on low-pop realms helps a lot.<br />3) Wait for realms to start going down or up, then pick a character in a realm that is online. You will know you're good when you get a yellow error message in your chat log saying that your cross-realm zone is offline (sorry, don't have exact quote)<br />4) Huzzah! You are now in your *own* realm's zone without any pesky neighbouring realms to bug you! Go get those rares!<br /><br />Your window of opportunity is usually 3-5 minutes or so, but I managed to catch the Minfernal and Flayer Youngling in the same restart session. If you can get online at the right time, this method is foolproof as long as the realm you're using is not too busy on its own.<br /><br />You can even &quot;scout ahead&quot; by using flight points in the zone, since flight points don't count as cross-realm until you land.</div>

But sure enough eventually I came accross a group of 3 adult ones with 2 babies :) Unfortunately they were both grey, but however.......! <br /><br />I really don't care hahhaa because with a pet buscuit and now being twice the size of my character who cares!

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Evangelyne</b></h3>I camped this so much looking for one! Not farming for rares or anything, I just wanted one!<br /><br />I wanted to add, that after 25-30 hours of farming the spawn areas, I switched to my hunter so I could track barrens giraffes and kill them to 'force' spawns. <br /><br />The giraffes spawn points are random, so it's important to keep flying around ALL the spawn points once you down the giraffes. I was killing giraffes then waiting at the spawn area for the respawns, for HOURS. Nothing. But, on my hunter, flew around after killing and within 20 minutes I had a calf! That's my tip! <br /><br />If you aren't a hunter (get someone to) cook you up some tracker snacks. 1 shoveltusk flank and 1 northern spices. You can track beasts for 1 hour. Handy!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rivenlea</b></h3>Just found mine at 43.16, 57.73 just south of Ruins of Taurajo wandering around by itself in the midst of sleeping lions. Had been trying to get one for a couple of weeks with no luck. I parked an alt at the tree by the road just south of Bael Mordan Excavation as I've seen a few Barrens Giraffe spawn there. My plan was to check for calves each night before logging off to go to bed, as some people with the same bad luck have said they found theirs in the early morning. Found mine just after 2am Server time on Gundrak (Oceanic). So if you're having trouble finding one, I would suggest parking an alt capable of flying and checking it each night. Hope this helps someone :)<br /><br />Edited to add: I've had times where I've flown around the zone for 2+ hours killing the giraffes trying to force a spawn and not seen any giraffes respawn at all, let alone the calves, and no bodies to show that someone had killed the respawns already. Of course 4 out of 5 times I tried I did get respawns, maybe a calf once or twice, but I've had the no-respawn thing happen more than once too. Then I've had other times when I've been randomly flying over on my way somewhere and on my own mount with no intention of capturing the pets and randomly found 3 in a pack. So yeah, if you have no luck the first time, (or first few times, as the case may be, with the rarity of this pet) persistence is key!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>427762</b></h3>Found TWO of these today on an alt.<br /><br />Both were common quality - announced in general to give the second to someone else.<br /><br />There were no giraffes around their location at all. One was slightly north of camp T ruins, the other in fields of blood - and they have a LONG pat range, unlike a lot of the battle pets.The one I was following to announce led me from one side of camp T all the way to the edge of the alli camp before starting back - so sitting still waiting at a spawn point may not work so well with these guys.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ooblushy88oo</b></h3>Boy do I have a mini story for you guys! :)<br /><br />I've been searching for this cutie for a while now and had no luck so I took my alt tonight (My Priest) and headed over to Fields of Blood. Was talking to a few in General who were looking for it as well. We all kept seeing the usual Adders or dem damn dogs so after killing some giraffe's wandering around, I did a fly by near <b>Fort Triumph</b> and low and behold, I saw TWO baby giraffe's walking with their pack.<br /><br />I immediately invited a Rogue who was looking for one as well, I got into my battle and she flew over and because of CRZ, it PHASED out for her. I was gutted! After I won my battle and tamed, I said I'd stay in group and help look for another! <br /><br />So I flew over to <b>Fields of Blood</b> and what do I see? ONE lonesome baby girafee calf walking by itself, the Rogue friend flew right over and was able to battle and tame hers as well.<br /><br />:D<br /><br />Was definitely a special tame! :)<br /><br />Keep searching guys, you will get one! Fields of Blood/Fort Triumph seem to be the <u>best</u> spots.<br /><br />Submitting my picture now. ^_^<br /><br /><b>Edit:</b> Just to share, I didn't care about quality with this pet because I wanted one so bad but mine was <b>Uncommon</b>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sarsorama</b></h3>Found mine today around 6am and it took about an hour of searching (was about to give up). <br /><br />Found my first 2 Barrens Giraffes at Frazzlecraz Motherlode (south of Desolation Hold) with no pet spawn, and then found another 2 with the spawn just a teensy bit north of Desolation Hold. <br /><br />I did circles around Southern Barrens using this macro:<br />/tar dusthoof<br />/tar barrens<br />/tar giraffe<br />Killed the giraffes to reset the spawn timer for others. <br /><br />Happy hunting! Hope your luck is as good as mine, if not better, since it seems like many others have spent far longer than me searching for this cute lil guy.<br /><br />(Edit: Messed up the info on where I found the spawns).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Calily</b></h3>I also used the macro : <br /><br />/tar dusthoof<br />/tar barrens<br />/tar giraffe<br /><br />Whenever I saw a giraffe without a baby I just killed them all. I also killed other yellows/tameable pets hoping to force a spawn. Oh, I also killed gazelles, not sure if they're on the same timer.<br /><br />I got a couple commons, two uncommons, and finally a rare around The Great Gate 41.92, 53.90.<br /><br />The commons I found in the very southernmost part and the uncommons I found in the field of blood area and one in desolation hold.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>930739</b></h3>Around 2:20 am after sitting waiting I came here read some comments, someone mentioned to kill Giraffes so I killed all kinds of Giraffes and zebras and rhinos and sure enough ten minutes later after killing my first Giraffe a Giraffe calf popped up right under a Dusthoof Giraffe I just killed. Been there since 8 pm. It's a bloody job.<br /><br />Edit:<br />One Common Giraffe Calf by itself South East of Ruins of Taurajo by a brazier 45 62 Uncommon Gazelle joined with it. Just north of this spot you can watch Giraffe spawn and be killed by the lions under the tree. Looked like a good spot if you wanted to camp.<br /><br />Edit 2:<br />As I stood there typing this report another player stood with me looking at my freshly tamed Giraffe Calf. Sure enough, moments later a lion killed a Giraffe and another Giraffe Calf showed up just in time for this other player to capture.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lottielot</b></h3>I spent over an hour flying around the Southern Barrens and couldn't find even an adult Giraffe. So I started killing battle pets all along the mountain range to the North West. Still nothing spawned. Eventually I found 2 adult Barrens Giraffe at the southern point of the battlescar. I killed them and waited for them to respawn as I heard they can respawn with a calf, but still nothing after 10 minutes. So I flew North again and found a pack of Barrens Giraffe's and one Calf! :) Finally! Captured it easily, got a Green Uncommon one. This was just North of Desolation Hold, as if u were almost in Desolation Hold's grounds.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lughnasadh</b></h3>Found mine a 42.4,42.6. It was walking alone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>verduran</b></h3>So far out of the 15+ calves that I have seen, I have never seen any of them accompanying the dusthoof giraffes, almost every one of them were with adults barrens giraffes. So I have doubt on whether killing the dusthoofs or other beasts around the area would help at all.<br /><br />A short while after the server came up this week (the server maintenance was expected to end at noon and the server came up at 7:30am instead, I logged on at 8), I went and checked the giraffes and I counted around 5 packs of 2/3 adults with 1/2 calves each. I checked each of the spawn and didn't find any rare, left the adults up and went to do dailies. About 2 hours later I came back and all 5 packs were intact and no calves has respawned. (so this time I cleared all of them).<br /><br />Yesterday when I was checking them up I noticed a lone calf wandering at around 50.6,51.2. Since I usually find the gazelles there I was wondering whether those two spawns are related. <br />However, earlier today I came across with a lone adult with 2 calves, and as soon as I finished checking the calves the adult was killed by one of the lions. Then A few hours later I found 2 lone calves wandering at the exact same spot. So it is possible that any lone calves you encounter are just the leftovers when their adults have been killed by the lions. (and are mistakened as spawns with Dusthoof Giraffes if they are close by)<br /><br />Edited: It would seem there the calves can indeed spawn alone without any adult around. I have seen at least 3 spots where they would spawn and only stays at that spot, instead of continuing on the route when the adults they've been accompanying are killed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>942158</b></h3>So I hate to admit i dedicated 7 hours straight to catching this little giraffe calf. I wokeup at 6am and started the grind. I had read all the tips and such on the forum about killing at the girfaffes and battle pets in the area. Although i'm not 100% if killing all the dusthoof giraffes helped, I reallly dont think killing the other battle pets does anything. 7 hours...seriously. I took a 2 hour break and didnt even bother with the other battle pets, just running around killing all giraffes and scanning the area. <br /><br />In 7 hours, i came across 6. Honestly not too many people have the patience to farm it. Or atleast the ones i saw stayed and farmed for maybe an hour. A tip: Be wary of using your mechanical animals against the giraffe calf . All the ones i fought were lvl10 and my mechanical is lvl 8, and by the magical forces id crit for 200 and kill it dead. So i got it down to 250 and used my whelpling to finish and trap him. I will also say that the dusthoof giraffes, and zhevra share a timer, one or the other will spawn. <br /><br />All the giraffe calves I came across wern't in typical spawn spots, just slightly off. So in lieu of my Giraffe genocide, i'll post the most frequest cords I found. As other posters said I never saw it with a dusthoof giraffe, only barren, or alone. Good luck!<br /><br />48,72<br />42,42<br />46.43</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jayne9878</b></h3>It took me a couple of days to get this. I recommend looking around with multiple servers/factions if possible to increase your chances of seeing them. I camped an alliance toon in Southern Barrens to look around periodically, not seeing any. Then I took a horde toon on another server and as I flew in I saw 3 Giraffe Calfs scattered in the zone. I checked the areas where they should have been and there were none to be found. There wasn't anyone else in the zone at the time I was there, so no one could have tamed all 3 giraffe calfs within 2 minutes of me getting there. <br /><br />I came back later than night and saw this particular calf in flight as I had seen the others earlier. This one was right by Vendetta Point. The giraffe traveled really fast, by himself. When I went to capture him he had moved clear over to 46, 42. Some people mentioned accidentally killing the calf when taming. I used a deer which does minimal dmg &amp; has a couple heals and it worked great, lvl 9 &quot;common&quot; quality. <br /><br />Someone in an earlier post mentioned there might be a bug:<br /><div class="quote-box">By royiouson (150 â€“ 2) 7 days ago (Patch 5.1.0)<br />I've also seen these while on a taxi, flown back, and they weren't there - has this bug been fixed?</div> <br />but I think the lions may be killing them. There were lions wherever I saw the calfs from the air. If you are going to camp the area I would recommend killing all the lions you see just in case.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rezzelyn</b></h3>It's 2:30pm Realm Time, I found a baby wandering by itself near the Alliance campsite near the forest border in Field of Blood. I've posted a screenshot to help you find the exact spot where i found it. The calf was walking from the direction of Taurajo, and its path curved around the hill and sent him towards the forest, on the tiny strip of grassland between the hills and the road. I didn't wait very long to watch his path because I didn't want someone to steal him from me. <br /><br />Honestly, I didn't know the giraffes traveled that far north, I've only ever found Dusthoofs in the northern area of Southern Barrens. If you guys find one, make sure to post a map of where and the route it seemed to take. That may help others who haven't caught theirs yet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>helver</b></h3>I ran into two of these together at 46.3, 58.2 - Just south of the Ruins of Tujaro. They were not travelling with any &quot;parents&quot;.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1066219</b></h3>I was beginning to give up home but I was able to catch a poor quality calf in the very early morning. I suggest if you have multiple characters on other servers to park them in the different spots where they spawn and just check them daily. That is how I got mine! Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JimiSue</b></h3>Having spent my hours (and days, and weeks) running around South barrens, I thought I'd share a bit of what I've learned on these, along with some still unanswered questions...<br /><br />To increase your chance of finding these elusive beasts, remember the following:<br /><br />1: There are two kinds of adult giraffe in this zone. Dusthoof Giraffes are irrelvant - you may as well ignore them.<br />2: Barrens Giraffes are all patrolling spawns. They do not shuffle around a single location, so if you think any mobs are placeholding and they are doing the same-spot shuffle, they are not placeholders.<br />3: While it is possible to encounter giraffe calves on their lonesome (or in pairs), without exception when I've seen them they have been walking the same path as one of the adult spawns - presumably mum, dad and strange uncle Jim have been picked off by lions, which for some reason ignore the calves (I've seen them do this - take out the adults and leave the calves).<br />4: If you are after a rare (since those stones that Blizz put in to level up pet quality seem impossibly elusive) then you are in this for the long haul. You will see more rare mobs (of the silver dragon type) than you will giraffe calves of any quality.<br /><br />So. When you find some Barrens Giraffes, spend some time following them. They always patrol the same routes. Learn the dozen or so routes for the different groups, and you will save yourself a lot of running around - you can cover all the routes in a single circuit of the zone once you know their quirks.<br /><br />They appear to be timed spawns. I've not nailed down the precise delay, but it's long. I initially though somewhere between one and two hours, but it ended up being 7 (as per my comment below). I am pretty sure that the calf spawns ae independent from the prarie dogs and adders that litter the zone, so it's probably only worth fighting them to level up your existing pets since clearing them will not spawn more calves.<br /><br />What I don't know is whether calves only spawn when the adults do, or if the adults (if left alone with a DVD and bottle of wine) will produce another one (like the mommy infested bears do over in Hillsbrad, or the Diemetradon hatchlings do in Ungoro). Which means I don't know if it is better to kill the adults to clear the spawn, or leave them to do their thing. So if anyone knows the answer, please say!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>781377</b></h3>Finally got one, on Christmas morning! :) He was walking all by himself near the Ruins of Taurajo. I didn't kill or battle anything beforehand, was just flying laps around the zone as usual and he just sort of popped up. As someone said before, he walks a really long distance, and I guess it's the long legs but he walks fast. I dismounted and was stressing out trying to switch out pets so that my high level pets didn't accidentally one shot him, and when I looked back up he was hauling ass away from me.</div>

Followed advice and flew around Desolation hold, Fort Triumph up to Forward command and Vendetta Point, killing all Giraffe and Zebra in my way...Finally happened upon 2 adults at 47;63 on the road out of Fort Triumph and killed them thinking i have not seen two together before, i went back around one more time about 5 mins later and found another 2 at exactly 48;75 and i think they were the same 2 perhaps respawned and taking the path back up to where i had killed the last 2. Anyhow this is where i found my little one, poor quality and staying that way until i get a beast token. Won't farm that anymore lol, eyes falling out of my head :P<br /><br />Good luck, hope that helps.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1069318</b></h3>Just caught an uncommon one south of the ruins of Taurajo, only a dust hoof giraffe was nearby.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>694270</b></h3>I've been going after this for a few days, and today I spent about 2 hours there flying around. My other times around I saw no giraffes at all, this time I found 3 separate packs of Barrens Giraffes at various points on the southern half of the map. One pack patting just north of Desolation Hold, another one across the scar by Fort Triumph and one more pack south between Desolation Hold and Razorfen Kraul. Flew around killing Zhevras, battle pets, Gazelles, tracked the Barrens Giraffes for a while with no luck, finally killed the packs of Giraffes and NEVER saw them respawn. I was about to give up when I saw one lone Giraffe Calf nowhere near where the packs were. (I don't recall exact location, I was too excited.) He was poor quality but I caught him and had a Flawless Beast Battle Stone handy luckily so I used it pretty much immediately. No way I was going back for more. Cute pet though and almost the same height as my Blood Elf :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1062573</b></h3>There are indeed quite a bit of these after a server restart, and they always walk around with a Giraffe npc. Unlike the impossible-to-find <a href="/npc=62317/minfernal">Minfernal</a>, these are spread around the zone, so a single person can't swoop them up in a matter of seconds.<br /><br />I pulled four times in a row and always got an uncommon-quality Giraffe and a rare Frog. Statistically, I think the odds are unlikely this was purely by chance, so it seems that you can only capture uncommon-quality Giraffes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>oakleafwolf</b></h3><ol><li><b><u>STRATEGY</u></b>- If lions are killing the giraffes, kill the lions.

Within 2 minutes of looking, I found one. I'd say late at night, very early in the morning when the population is thin and no ones around the area is the best time to be looking.... because an hour later, he got one too.<br /><br />Or we both just got extremely lucky.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>skitlem</b></h3>I noticed that when I fly over southern barrens on a flight path that I could see the Giraffes calfs everywhere, however when i would fly to the spots I would see them the would be gone, just seconds after. <b>I realized that that they must be out of phase</b>. so I did all the quests in the area and sure enough I got one with in a min. it was worth the 45 mins of questing the area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JimiSue</b></h3>I had a live and learn moment today. I have left a character in this zone to do a run around from time to time (I live in the UK and play on a US server so being on when the USA is asleep is easy for me) but I had been fighting tougher critters elsewhere and burning through the weaker pets from time to time. So this morning I was doing the run around, and as I was doing it I swapped back in some pets that were in need of healing/resurrection. But the button had not refreshed, so I kept on the circuit. And found a calf (just west of Forward Command, for what that's worth).<br /><br />Naturally, I engaged it, only to find that it was a rare quality... my moment of sick relief was short when I realised I had still not healed my pets. Which means that I had a Brown Rabbit on 69 hit points (albeit a level 11 rabbit, but a rabbit nonetheless) to fight a rare quality calf and an emerald boa.<br /><br />I didn't win. So, one month into camping, I'm looking at another long stretch. I was about ready to cry until I realised it's just a game :)<br /><br />The moral is - always keep pets healthy enough to win when camping anything rare, or like me you may miss your chance.</div>

I already had an uncommon giraffe and am working on upgrading all my lesser quality to rares. Found only 1 pack of 3 adult Barrens giraffes along with a calf. Not my usual luck with RNG but it was a rare. I also killed off the adults. Still needed to upgrade my Prairie dog to blue so while doing so I saw another pack spawn with another calf. So apparently killing of adults that have a calf with them will spawn another pack with spawn. Can't say so unequivocally as a sample rate of 1 is not really hard data.</div>

Seems to me the best thing to do is be here at a time when nobody else is around to take them first, maybe. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>vanitdi</b></h3>Found one running with two adults on the north side of Desolation Hold. The adults disappeared after the battle. It was poor, but the first one I saw.<br /><br />Edit: Found another one with two adults at 44.69 78.42. Poor again though.<br /><br />Second Edit: Another one close at 46.50 79.85. Uncommon this time, and, of course, I accidentally killed it. So just poor for me today. I did go back for one more circle. The Desolation Hold adults were back, with no calf. And two more adults just south of my last calf sighting, by themselves.<br /><br />Update: I had logged out in the area, and flew out to where I had seen giraffes before today. A calf with two adults 48.87 81.58. Rare, so I'm done hunting. Good luck.</div>

After many flights through Southern Barrens I finally saw one. And once I found one I found 8. Best was uncommon and will be getting a Flawless Battle-stone used on him.<br /><br />For a day/time reference It was a Thursday morning 828 cst.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>OldWolf2</b></h3>These are quite difficult to capture - prepare a special team before-hand so you can guarantee the capture when you get one! I've killed two already today by accident. (with all low pets on my team)<br /><br />They can heal about 20% of their health per turn; So it is nearly impossible to get them low enough to capture, but without risking a critical strike killing them (I did this twice). Bring pets with defense/self-healing, and small attacks so that you can crit and not kill it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Eillesthis</b></h3>My advice after unsuccessfully trying the fly-around-and-look-for-them approach:<br /><br />Park yourself at 44.5,80.0 (<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/maps?data=4709:445800">see this map</a> if you're more visual). You'll be within range of the end points of two paths - one family that goes north, and another that goes southeast - which I believe are spawn points, as well the middle of the path for a third family. Set NPCScan or SilverDragon to search for ID 3248 (<a href="/npc=3248/barrens-giraffe">Barrens Giraffe</a>), clear your cache, turn up the volume, and wait. Scanning for the Calf does not help because it's cached by your Pet Journal when you log in, and and it has no nameplate so SilverDragon can't see it unless you mouse over.<br /><br />I have not seen a childless group give birth to a new calf (which doesn't mean it can't happen), but I have seen new families spawn with a calf. So, if you see the former, maybe kill them, but not near your camp site, else you have to wait for their bodies to disappear before you can reset your cache again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>auredria</b></h3>Did a couple rounds of following the paths that everyone has been mentioning for about 20 mins, got nothing so I figured I'd kill some of the lvl 1 pets not tagged for pet battle, Zhevras, Elder Zhevras along with the plainstriders. Did that for a good half hour, got bored so I decided to see if any Barrens Giraffes and/or Calf have spawned along the route I did earlier. Found 2 Barrens Giraffes doing a patrol along the route between 47,60 and 46,67. No calf yet, will update soon. P.S. I am on Zangarmarsh server and its about 4:45am server time when I started.<br /><br />Edit: Decided to go the full round, 18 mins after posting this, found a calf with 3 Barrens Giraffes. Just went after the calf, ignored the adults, was a poor quality, but was totally glad I finally caught the elusive Giraffe Calf!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1062573</b></h3>I was able to do some extensive testing on this pet on a server that at the time had no cross-realm over the course of a few days, allowing me to determine with relatively high confidence how this pet spawn works. Note that I say this is a person who at this time has captured (not upgraded with a stone) a rare version of every battle pet except for 5, so by this point I'm fairly well acquainted with the various spawn mechanics of pets. I only say this because this pet is relatively unique, so I want to give some justification that I'm not just randomly stating what I've observed.<br /><br />Anyway, this pet does follow a parent-child mechanic with the adult Giraffes, but it's a unique mechanic. Every parent-child pet works in the following way: when a mob spawns, it has a chance to be a &quot;mother&quot;. If it is a mother spawn, it will spawn a child roughly every 10 minute. If you kill a non-mother spawn (indicated by not having a child), it has a chance to respawn as a mother or non-mother; but if you kill the mother, it too has a chance to respawn as a mother or non-mother. Children will follow the mother wherever they go, and if the mother is killed, they will simply despawn after a certain amount of time (roughly 5 minutes). This of course only applies to the limited number of pets that follow the mother-child relationship. <br /><br />The Giraffe Calf only follows half of these mechanics. It will still follow the mother around and will despawn after a certain time if the mother dies. Even without players killing the mothers, lions occasionally does this, so you sometimes see lone Giraffe Calves near the west gate where lions are common. However, Giraffe Calves ONLY spawn when the Giraffes themselves spawn; if you attack the pet and do not kill the mother, new Giraffe Calves will not spawn. The spawn rate of a Giraffe Calf seems to be relatively high per pack; I'm not completely sure yet if every Giraffe Calf in the pack has a chance to spawn a pet, or if the pack as a whole has a chance, but regardless, I'd say at least half the time, the pack will spawn with one or more Calves (I've never seen more than 2, leading me to believe it's a pack-based chance). <br /><br />When you see a Giraffe, kill it after pulling any pets; this will allow the Giraffe to respawn. If you don't kill it, it won't respawn and you won't get new pets. One note however. Pet collectors are likely used to killing enough pets in the zone forcing respawns. The Giraffe mothers do not work like this; they seem to respawn zone-wide at certain intervals as far as I can tell, or at a minimum, it's not a fixed spawn time. The reason I say this is that many times I killed a Giraffe only to found it had respawned 5 minutes later, and other times it took an hour to spawn. Either way, for those wondering, I'd say on average it takes about half an hour for the Giraffes to respawn, but this is random, so you shouldn't necessarily set your watch to it.<br /><br />Like many Pandaria pets, Giraffes Calves follow &quot;pack&quot; rules. That means that, for example, if you see a pack of Giraffes and there are two Calves, both of the pulls will be identical. That is, each Calf in the pack will pull as a Calf of the same rarity, the same single secondary pet, and the secondary pet having the same rarity. Thus, if you're farming rares, you can save a few seconds when you find 2 Calves in a pull by simply killing the other one along with the pack if you've already seen the first one doesn't have a rare; the second one will be the same.<br /><br />An interesting quirk is that a server restart forces all Giraffes to respawn, so the zone becomes flooded with Giraffe Calves. Unlike <a href="/npc=62854/scourged-whelpling">Scourged Whelpling</a> and <a href="/npc=62317/minfernal">Minfernal</a>, these pets are spread over a large area, so if you're already in Southern Barrens when the restart ends, you should be able to get one before someone can farm all the Calves in the zone (since it will take them a good ten minutes or so to check the whole zone). An interesting quirk to this; after a server restart, for some reason, the entire set of Calf spawns follows pack rules. That is, every single Calf in the zone will be an identical pull, a phenomenon I've never noticed (yet) with any other pet. I've yet to confirm if this same sort of &quot;zone-wide&quot; pack respawn can occur other than after a restart; it's hard to tell as if only a few Giraffes respawn at a time, you might see the same primary and secondary spawn, but if they're on other sides of the zone when this happens, it's nearly impossible to tell if this is just luck or an actual mechanic.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1012488</b></h3>So far all of these comments have been about finding and capturing this elusive pet. Now for a word on it as a battle pet: this long-necked bastard is TOUGH! How tough? I took mine out to Pandaria at level 17, and it was SOLOING trios of level 24 critters in the Valley of Four Winds. Needless to say, he levels quickly; and if your short on healers for your group it can fill in nicely at level 20 by arranging it's abilities accordingly. Definately a great addition to your collection.</div>

There are numerous spawns of this rare battle pet after a server restart. I went out searching right after the server restart on Blackhand.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tattedspyder</b></h3>Out pet hunting and get to the Southern Barrens. Giraffe Calf is on my list of needed pets so I start combing the area. Boom, 3 minutes into the search, there's a GC. Without thinking I pop into battle and realize that I hadn't swapped my pets so I'm about to fight a level 10 with three level 3s, not good. I forfeit the match because there's no way to win and as I'm swapping my pets around another player swoops in and snatches the spawn.<br /><br />Lesson learned: be freaking prepared.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1066134</b></h3>This was what worked for me. <br />I flew around until I found Barrens Giraffes, I killed them. <br />I also killed any Dusthoof Giraffes, despite whether or not they affect spawn. I kept left clicking critters and battle pets and killing them with a spell. (Not battling them). <br /><br />It took me two hours, but then three Barrens Giraffes had spawned with two Giraffe Calfs. I captured the first one which was 'common' but left the other.<br /><br />My girlfriend did a similar thing, she would find Barrens Giraffes, kill one, follow them around, kill surrounding critters and finally she captured a green Giraffe Calf. It took her three hours. She also killed Gazelles, but I did not.<br /><br />Not sure if these are strategies but it's what worked for us!<br />Expect to spend some time on safari.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1116883</b></h3>Flew around the zone for about 3 hours before deciding to start killing giraffe packs. I killed two packs and flew down south, saw my first giraffe calf. Entered battle and it was a RARE! I almost peed my pants. It was level 10. Then my stupid pet that was three levels lower crit the giraffe and killed it. I nearly cried. I can't decide if I want to spend the weekend camping for another or just give up. I've come up against this in battle and it's TOUGH. It heals like crazy. I did invest in a Terrible Turnip so I hope this won't happen again in the future.<br /><br />For those interested it spawned near Bael Modan on the east side of the road with a pack of three Barrens Giraffes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1116883</b></h3>Ok. Here is what I have. I initially located a trio of <b>Barrens Giraffes</b> patrolling near Bael Modan (around 49.00, 80.00) with a giraffe calf. This was the first calf I had seen after three consecutive hours of killing every type of giraffe, zhevra, plainstrider, lion all over the Southern Barrens map. And the calf was a rare. Unfortunately my pet crit the calf and killed it. *sigh* I cannot stress enough to be PREPARED. <br /><br />I stayed in the Southern Barrens for eight more consecutive hours (only left the computer for about 4 minutes for a bathroom break) flying, killing and didn't see another giraffe calf spawn for a very long time. At that time, two giraffe calves spawned with <b>DUSTHOOF giraffes</b> just outside of the great gate. Both were poor quality. I lost the first battle and the trapped calf was lost (rare emerald boa as the secondary). I captured the second poor quality calf. Now, I stayed just outside of the great gate and saw two more calves spawn within 15 minutes also with Dusthoof giraffes. Both were poor quality. I have since seen multiple Dusthoof Giraffes spawn outside of The Great Gate. I have killed them and seen zhevras and lions spawn in their place. <br /><br /><b>As far as my experience they DO spawn with the Dusthoof Giraffes</b> but others have claimed that they do not. <br /><br />I hope this helps someone. This was about 7:30-8:30am server time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1116883</b></h3>All of you who have spent hours upon hours farming for this pet just for the achievement OR for a rare of this and don't like having to farm/camp for it then do yourself a favor and go make a death knight on the Brazilian realm &quot;Gallywix&quot; and go get your giraffe calf. I did this and farmed my rare. <br /><br />Every hour there would be 5-10 (either five singles, five sets of twins, or a variation) giraffe calves up at one time. I'd cycle through each spawn location and check for my rare, kill the calves that weren't rare and all Barrens giraffes, rinse and repeat. I never encountered anyone else in the zone looking for a giraffe calf. I only encountered one other person altogether...a lowbie horde questing there.<br /><br />It took an hour and a half for me to roll my DK, quest it out of the starting area, and have it sitting in Southern Barrens. The first time I looked for a giraffe calf on my own realm it was four hours before I saw my first spawn (which happened to be a rare...and my pet crit and killed it *sigh*). <br /><br />For the quickest method I recommend making a Horde DK so that once you do your last DK quest in Orgrimmar then you will already be in Kalimdor and have a very short flight to the Southern Barrens. I made a human without thinking and had to jump through a few hoops to get to the Southern Barrens...more time wasted.<br /><br />I also recommend doing this for harder to find pets like the Minfernal. When I got my Minfernal there were four other Minfernals up at the time.</div>

I got up this morning with my cuppa coffee and settled down for a long spawn hunt for Giraffe's and their babies. I make my target macro ready on my spam 1 key and start flying... 1min later omfg a calf lights up! so I drop down and engage the little pita and its a RARE! took a long time to whittle his HP down because i was freaking out that my level 8 Rare Harpy was going to pwn this lvl9 Girrafe baby and I would be devastated but finally the capture lit up and FIRST THROW I caught it. So now I have all this free time available and am totally stoked because as a general rule, if people are saying they hunted for 2hrs for an item, I have to hunt 4 before mine drops.

I hit all the hotspots along the Southern Barrens road, along the hills and on the other side of the rift. I did see three of the Barrens Giraffe's running and followed them awhile, but still didn't find any calf. I decided to just kill them and then went over to the Marsh to fight the battle pet master and come back to see if they did a respawn.<br /><br />Probably 45 min later I came back, followed the route again and found a lone giraffe calf along the hills near those Pridemane lions sleeping around the tree. The calf was grey and it had a second petr join it. A blue emerald boa, I kept the giraffe even though it is grey, like the other poster I'll see if I can get a better one later, but these are too rare to just let go. ;)<br /><br />Edited to add: This is right near the forward command.

Doing nothing but searching does not effect the spawn table at all - so you have to do be aggressive about making them spawn and start killing the place holders...<br /><br />I know it works because I've tried this on multiple mobs all over the world and I always get my rare...</div>

I then ran around Southern Barrens for about 15 minutes and found one. I killed lots of zebras, plain striders, and gazelles. Don't think that made any difference.

Nothing I did had anything to do with where I finally found it. I realize this won't be a popular post, lol, but I really believe it's the truth. Good luck to you all!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>radicarl</b></h3>I cannot say it enough: go to an empty realm to catch the rare battle pets. I got this and a Minfernal on Vashj both within 10 minutes of deciding &quot;hey as long as I'm grouped with a friend on this empty server, I ought to go look for battle pets&quot; (and most of the time was spent traveling or battling, not searching).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sailoranchored93</b></h3>Finally found mine after weeks of searching. It was right by the gate that leads to Thunder Bluff. It is common quality, but since it is the only one I have seen in weeks, I snatched it. I flew around and looked for some others in case I could catch a rare, but it didn't happen. But that's what Battle-Stones are for. (; It is 1am server time on Mal'Ganis. My advice is to either wait until really late at night or early in the morning or hop over to a dead server. Other than that, you're in for the long haul. Good luck and happy battling.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Malthmazar</b></h3>Found two with parents just west of Bael Modan in Southern Barrens. You really can't be picky with the rarities of them. They're hard to find.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>geekygirlish</b></h3>As breeds go, they only have two and both are pretty poor. Don't think it will make a very good battle pet. So don't be too fussy about what quality you get with these. Just grab one to get it, and count towards the achievement. <br /><br />I suspect these are a bit like the bear cubs and diemetrodons, etc. They spawn around a parent. I've only ever seen two, one was already being captured with mom standing by and the second that I grabbed, spawned behind mom right by forward command. Luckily I was there.<br /><br />Killing other battle pets like the copious prairie dogs and adders like I was doing might help generate a spawn, but I am not convinced killing the adult giraffes will actually improve your chances.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>vexed001</b></h3>Spent a lot of time here to even find one. There were no other Giraffes in the area when i found mine but there were lions i assume they killed the parent and left the pet. i used this macro to help me find it just kept spamming as i flew around <br /><br />/target giraffe calf<br />/run SetRaidTarget(&quot;target&quot;, 4)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Faicela</b></h3>I found mine at 42, 42 around 10:30AM Eastern time. For those who don't use coordinates, he was right above the Vendetta Point (Southern Barrens), just north of the flight path there.He was walking with his mommy. Lol. Good luck.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Saphiria</b></h3>Found one, accidentally killed it, so i killed all pets in the area and another spawned in like 10seconds and got it</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>923073</b></h3>As others have said, the key is to kill other pets in the zone so that Giraffe Calf can spawn. I found the Forward Command area (50, 50) to be a great place to camp because a ton of pets spawn all around it. I simply killed pets in that area for about 10 minutes until this guy spawned.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>76663</b></h3>I've hunted this for months. I've tried everything listed in the comments. This time I changed my tactic. It was not after any server reset, what I did was make a simple macro to target Giraffe Calf while flying over I spammed the macro button. At loc 43, 54 I got a hit. Two were walking side-by-side. I nabbed the first one with my Terrible Turnip which was poor quality. Yes, I was an ass and took the second one too. It was uncommon. I'm still one away from the achievement though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gatekus</b></h3>I am on a medium population server with fairly active CRZ. However, just north of Bael Modan at 48, 81 at 1:40 AM on Sunday morning I was able to locate a Giraffe Calf and successfully capture it. Perhaps it helped that this was during a holiday (Midsummer Festival), and other achievement/pet hunters were congregating in cities instead of searching for pets. Regardless, I wanted to throw the coordinates out there because I roamed all over Southern Barrens and this was the only Giraffe Calf I found. Perhaps this will help someone else find theirs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kdarm86</b></h3>I was finally able to find this pet by killing the giraffes I saw, then one calf popped up behind me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1362721</b></h3>Can someone please explain where you're seeing these stupid giraffes?<br />I have been flying around the southern barrens for hours on two different servers and i can't find a single giraffe (barrens or dusthoof) and I cannot find even a single gazelle which are supposed to share spawns either. No giraffes or gazelles means no pet.<br /><br />this site specifically lists barrens giraffes as being in the northern barrens which is a trip up too.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Leonan</b></h3>I found this battle pet following <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=3248">Barrens Giraffe</a>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>816705</b></h3>just want to make this clear should i kill barren giraffe's to make them respawn with a calf?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Moirine</b></h3>Today, in LFR I popped this guy out and gave him a pet biscuit. In the middle of the fight (and after), people were saying things like, &quot;D@mn giraffe is distracting,&quot; or, &quot;I didn't know giraffes were indigenous to Pandaria..&quot; It was pretty entertaining.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1330137</b></h3>This is making me so mad. I have killed everything said in these comments for two days. Also, I started killing everything just to cover all bases. They always respawn with no babies. Making me crazy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1395651</b></h3>I just got mine - was the first I've seen in probably 5+ hours of going around there and I dont care about its quality.<br /><br />I think the zebras and giraffes share spawn points and was killing all that I saw. Oddly enough, I don't think this helped because when I was flying away from one spawn location, I happened to look at my map and saw the calf disappearing behind me. Where it spawned was near a normal spawn point (south of ruins of camp t) but was just walking with its parent in a path I hadn't seen before. I can't believe that I just randomly looked at my map and then spammed my macro, swooped in and got that sucker. That I got it or where is pretty immaterial but that it was not in one of the normal giraffe spawn points is pretty important IMO.<br /><br />I suspect that it spawns with normal spawn points or at other random points near there with its parents. I highly advise spamming a macro and also just checking the pets in the map. I don't know if the killing of all the others worked as it was not in a place where I had ever seen one. I guess it's therapeutic and from other posts here where it was just standing there with the normal spawn (and from the map of catches) maybe not totally worthless. Were I a betting person, I would probably say that this spawn is unrelated to normal giraffe spawns and can pop up anywhere where the giraffe roam.<br /><br />I just used a /tar giraffe macro...<br /><br />Good luck all :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gardengirlbc</b></h3>Just got mine today. I have been looking and had only seen 2 giraffe total, and no herds. I had almost given up and was just flying around randomly and there they were! A whole herd of giraffe plus a baby. Poor quality but I don't care.<br /><br />Located at 42, 40, just slightly north of Vendetta Point.<br /><br />Good luck everyone!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mathaylla</b></h3>I found a poor quality one just north of Bael Modan and accidentally killed it... After flying up and down Southern Barrens for the next 4 hours, spamming /tar Giraffe macro, I finally found another one at 43,55 - an uncommon, too! I know I wasn't the only one looking for it, since I saw other people flying up and down about the same path as me, and I kept coming across corpses of giraffes (so someone was trying to trigger the spawn). I'm pretty certain it didn't make any difference, nor did battling other pets in the area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kamalii63</b></h3>I found 2 of them with adult Giraffe's at 46, 84 near Bael Modan and no I didn't take both! I left 1 for someone else :) Good luck and happy hunting</div>

I'm working on my Kalimdor Safari achievement, and the giraffe calf was one of the last few ones I need. First capturable pet that came up on my map as I flew from Dustwallow Marsh and into Southern Barrens, just north of Bael Modan, a few steps away from the road leading down into Dustwallow Marsh. It was following a single grown giraffe around. Happy hunting!</div>

Most likely their realms are just full of pet poachers and killers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>milundaria</b></h3>Just got one today, still very low rate to find. Comments from the past were still quite helpful. I did kill the Mother Giraffe upon capturing the Giraffe Calf.

    <p>The <b>Wowhead Client</b> is a little application we use to keep our database up to date, and to provide you with some nifty extra functionality on the website! &nbsp;</p>
    <div class="pad2"></div>
    <p>It serves 2 main purposes: &nbsp;</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>It maintains a WoW addon called the <b>Wowhead Looter</b>, which collects data as you play the game! &nbsp;</div></li>
        <li><div>It uploads the <b>collected data</b> to Wowhead in order to keep the database up-to-date! &nbsp;</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can also use it to keep track of your completed quests, recipes, mounts, companion pets, and titles!&nbsp;</p>
