There is not enough data to suggest whether certain types of food affect the chance.\n\nThe average list price on auction houses for [npc=78895], based on all US realms, is 5695 gold as of September 2015, and is routinely around 2000 gold on high population realm like Stormrage-US. (Source: [url=https:\/\/theunderminejournal.com\/#us\/stormrage\/battlepet\/1395]The Undermine Journal[\/url]).\n\nBased on this info, depending on the pet's value on your realm (2k-6k gold), and an estimated 1 in 2000 proc rate, you could figure that each time you cook an item, the chance of a pet spawning adds 1 to 3 gold worth of value. So it's not worth cooking food at much of a loss to try and get this pet, unless you've got some psychological fixation on proccing it yourself, or you can't find one for sale on a realm where you have enough gold to buy one. If you cook food to sell at a profit, this adds a small chance of some extra profit...or a grotesque pet if you want to keep it!","date":"2015-09-14T18:01:37-05:00","rating":65,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2015-09-14T18:02:30-05:00",2,"Aaahead"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":29,"id":2253337,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"schnizol","body":"As it was stated you can't feed it with Pet biscuits (that doubles size) because you get a warning that 'food cannot eat food'\r\nBUT\r\nLil' Leftovers can eat a happy pet snack...\r\nIt'd be funnier if they were consistent about such jokes (the joke was hilarious - I laughed when I saw the message :D)","date":"2015-09-17T17:35:34-05:00","rating":9,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":30,"id":2561957,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"HappyAnt","body":"Just to confirm, it does drop in Legion.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1264043</b></h3>Cadistra's comic aside, I'd love to get one of these for having kept so many cooking ingredients in the bank for donkey's years.<br /><br />Wait! No! I clean out my bank! Honest!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mysticwarriormj</b></h3>This is what happens when food turns from bad to really Bad. (On a side note I was going to put something other then really bad but I assume &quot;Adult Language&quot; is a no no here so I didn't put it down)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Klaital1</b></h3>Thats really weird ability set for that pet... only the first slot ones do damage (and neither really that good alone as chew has cooldown and absorb does really low damage), rest is just all kinds of utility things. I guess best setup is chew, and food coma as they sort of combo, with either crouch or stench, depending on whether you prefer guaranteed damage reduction or rng.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Saqib</b></h3>This is a very good ability set, i can see him as a perfect pet for catching pets in the wild. The abilities don't hit that hard, he has limited heals, cleanse and a stun. As well as the magic racials make him immune to those hard hitting pets (Lil' Oondasta vs my level 1 Filthiling...took Oondasta 3 turns to kill it :D).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>potrock</b></h3>Created this pet today, there is no recipe for it and I'm not sure if it comes from any cooking recipe but it popped into my bags as an extra while i was cooking my <a href="/spell=173979/feast-of-the-waters">Feast of the Waters</a>.<br /><br />Made 100 feasts so either I am lucky or someone can go make a million more to figure out a drop chance, but I have no clue whether it can proc from other food.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AntiMeter</b></h3>Since I've collected hundreds of Crescent Saberfish from leveling up fishing, I decided to see if spamming the Saberfish recipes would yield one of these little guys. After making over hundred sets of the recipes, no Lil Leftovers for me.<br /><br />Either bad RNG for me, or his drop rate is exclusive to the Feasts of Draenor (which is honestly more likely).</div>

Not saying I'm correct but that's the drop rate I got.<br /><br />Enjoy<br />Kay<br /><br />BTW: I just might buy 1k spiced bread mats hit cook all and come back an hour later just to see if it dropped.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DarthEnder</b></h3>I really hope that the new fish recipes in 6.1 will drop this pet. They'll be much easier to farm mats for than any of the recipes that currently drop it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tale</b></h3>I'm starting to wonder whether there's something to the idea that multistrike food has a higher chance. That's a peculiar connection for the code to have, but after cooking a few hundred Draenor recipes on alts today (none of which were multistrike food), I switched over to my main to make my first stack of the new 125 multistrike food, <a href="/item=122344/salty-squid-roll">Salty Squid Roll</a>. Lil' Leftovers popped on the second one.<br /><br />Probably just confirmation bias, but there it is.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>NelleRavencrest</b></h3>Just got it from doing the new 125 crit food (Pickled Eel). After about 200-300 of them.</div>

There is not enough data to suggest whether certain types of food affect the chance.<br /><br />The average list price on auction houses for <a href="/npc=78895/lil-leftovers">Lil' Leftovers</a>, based on all US realms, is 5695 gold as of September 2015, and is routinely around 2000 gold on high population realm like Stormrage-US. (Source: <a href="https://theunderminejournal.com/#us/stormrage/battlepet/1395" rel="nofollow">The Undermine Journal</a>).<br /><br />Based on this info, depending on the pet's value on your realm (2k-6k gold), and an estimated 1 in 2000 proc rate, you could figure that each time you cook an item, the chance of a pet spawning adds 1 to 3 gold worth of value. So it's not worth cooking food at much of a loss to try and get this pet, unless you've got some psychological fixation on proccing it yourself, or you can't find one for sale on a realm where you have enough gold to buy one. If you cook food to sell at a profit, this adds a small chance of some extra profit...or a grotesque pet if you want to keep it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>schnizol</b></h3>As it was stated you can't feed it with Pet biscuits (that doubles size) because you get a warning that 'food cannot eat food'<br />BUT<br />Lil' Leftovers can eat a happy pet snack...<br />It'd be funnier if they were consistent about such jokes (the joke was hilarious - I laughed when I saw the message :D)</div>
