Waited 20 mins, killed some more, 2 minutes later another 2 spawns!","creationdate":"2012-12-03T13:57:39-06:00","id":607107,"rating":7,"commentid":1744539,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"Zaxy","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"I can confirm that killing the elementals seems to helps to let the Fel Flames spawn :) Had to look for another rare one after my first rare spawn killed himself with his scorched earth ability :\/","creationdate":"2012-12-24T06:43:18-06:00","id":615300,"rating":1,"commentid":1744539,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"960349","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"I tried this.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tradissa</b></h3>Many spawns available. Had to go through about 20 of these to find a rare. <br /><br />Poor = 1000-1150<br />Uncommon = 1200-1300<br />Rare = 1300+<br /><br />Hard for me to get, even using some level 23 pets, but probably using the wrong team make up. <br /><br />Flayer Youngling<br />Tor'vir Scarab<br />Horned Lizard<br /><br />They do get downgraded from level 20 to level 18. My rare had 1200 HP after capture + win. <br /><br />Not sure if the downgrading is as intended or bug.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>These creatures are actually found throughout the 'fel lava' areas. If there's green fire, there is probably a Fel Flame somewhere nearby. They may be hard to catch, but they're quite easy to find. Clicking on them gives a deep rushing roaring sound. The same sound that aggro fire elementals make.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Niley</b></h3>Anyone else is having issue with these phasing out?<br />When i took a flight path from shattarah to wildhammer, I saw dozens of them, as soon as I landed there were none.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1039579</b></h3>for some reason, after visiting the fel pits a few times, even after a server restart, there are no spawns of fel flames at all, only enrage fore spirit mobs and earth mobs. i have come with multiple charicters ( on diffrent phases - some that i have heavily quested with in the area and some newer charicters that i have not at all, and the entire area is tottaly clear of fells. any idea on that?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Roesia</b></h3>Just caught both of my uncommon Fel Flames just west of Warden's Cage at approximately coordinates 51,53. (Had to use my key-binded &quot;Interact with Target&quot; button for the one on the hill.)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>230067</b></h3>Some of the Fel Flames seem to spawn in places that don't allow you to start the battle. For example underneath the green lava. Killing them allows them to respawn in a place you can battle them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>380620</b></h3>If you're having trouble finding these little guys, I have had much more success in the evening or during the night. It might be bad farming on my end, but I haven't found one during the day. I have found multiple ones at night around 8 p.m. or so. Give it a try. <br /><br />I hope this helps, but this is just anecdotal.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>KNTM</b></h3>This is a pet I had some difficulty finding. I finally found it on Trollbane-US at around 7:00 A.M realm time. I battled three before I found a rare. Wasn't extremely difficult to capture with a 22 critter and 23 frog. As a pet, the scorched earth and conflagrate do work very well together. You can often kill a pet in 2-3 rounds with them. To those who don't have this pet, it really is a must have.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Random33698</b></h3>I tried killing the elementals around the area to try to force a spawn - 3am server time... it seemed to work... no one else was around. Took about 5 min.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Deventon</b></h3>Caught some ones today.<br />It's strange that they get more HP if you catch them - the Level 20 Fel Flame (uncommon) i caught had about 1100 HP and when it was mine it had 1297 HP, although it was downgraded to Level 19.<br /><br />So, these values by Tradissa are right in one way - if you see a one with 1220 HP, get it, its rare!<br />Needed about 30 Pet Battles because i lost against my first rare. <br /><br />Its definitely worth it!<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>919043</b></h3>These pets are certainly the rarest in the zone. There doesn't appear to be any kind of weather or time involved in finding the however. Most of the time I have seen none and then occasionally I see one or two.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Exe444</b></h3>As a mage you can pull this guy with spellsteal and drag it out of the lava. Then use invis and immediately right-click it.<br /><br />Worked quite well for me if the spawn was inside the lava.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LeiaSolo</b></h3>I found a TON of them in the river east of the mountain on the map. However, I had to go into the river and deal with the periodic fire damage. Surprisingly, during the battle my pets would also take occasional additional damage from the fire. So if you're willing to stand in the fire for these pets, try to fight fast.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1043922</b></h3>After stopping by this zone 2-3 times a day for over a week and never seeing even one of these pets, today I saw two - one by the first &quot;D&quot; in Hand of Gul'Dan and the other by the &quot;W&quot; in Warden's Cage. Captured one and got the Outland Tamer achievement. However, I didn't get the Outland Safari achievement (I only needed the Fel Flame to finish it). Must be bugged.<br /><br />ETA: Relogging fixed the achievement bug, and Outland Safari is completed now.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>897572</b></h3>Finally found one at 5am server time, near north of Hand of Gul'Dan.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1040377</b></h3>Found mine east of The Hand of Gul'dan, but they can spawn in any green lava pools</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>233270</b></h3>First time I flew into Shadowmoon Valley (on a flight path) I saw dozens of these guys darting my map (hovered over, definitely all Fel Flames). I was so excited, I thought I had just caught a spawning frenzy.<br /><br />Landed and flew back to the spot to find none were up. Clearly MY server has tons of these up, but because of the stupid CRZ, there aren't actually any up.<br /><br />So if you're on a flight path and see a bunch, don't get your hearts up because you're in your own realm on a FP, but transition to CRZ once off of it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pinkyinkydoo</b></h3>I was having the same issue with no spawns then today there were tons at 2pm then by 2:16 they were all gone. I only saw one other person searching for him. He got the rare and not me right before they stopped spawning.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1065297</b></h3>I posted a ticket about 4 hours ago, had a GM send me a message regarding the pet, and how it's currently tied to a phasing issue, where you must complete the &quot;Cipher of Damnation&quot; quest chain to get the pets to spawn.<br /><br />The entire quest chain on my 90 mage took about 45 minutes, and sure enough, once I completed the final quest, I found a Fel Flame of my own. Not as common a pet as I expected from the mapping on WoWhead, but still able to be found!<br /><br />Best of luck, Pet-Hunters and the like!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Slummish</b></h3>I don't know if the spawn rate has been changed... These little guys used to only spawn one at a time and had about 5 distinct spawning points. However, I just flew over the area on my way to BT (not on a flightpath affected by the CRZ trickery, but flew by hand) and there were about 8 Fel Flames up all over the Guldan's mountain area. It was 04:25am server time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jaderianne</b></h3>As of January 3rd,2013 I found three Fel Flames in Shadowmoon Valley at 57/52 on the little islands.It was not after server reset .So they can be captured randomly by those who are looking for one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aranyszin</b></h3>Despite being capturable, I finally gave in and burned a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=92665#comments">Flawless Elemental Battle-Stone</a> on it. The spawn timer seems a little long, and the area was pretty heavily farmed. After checking the area at random periods over a week or so, I encountered around 25, the vast bulk of which were poor and common (only 2 or 3 were uncommon). I have not personally encountered any of these as a secondary, but invite others to comment if they have.<br /><br />My suggestion is to decide whether you want a breed 6, breed 7 or breed 9 version (I have heard rumors of a breed 5 popping up, but have not seen confirmation), focus on catching one with that stat-configuration and then upgrade it later.<br /><br />His ability-set is identical to the <a href="/npc=25706/searing-scorchling">Searing Scorchling</a> (with which it shares a model) and the <a href="/npc=16701/spirit-of-summer">Spirit of Summer</a>.<br /><br />For comparison's sake, the <a href="/npc=62621/fel-flame">Fel Flame</a> offers three health-heavy breeds: a &quot;tankey&quot; breed 6 (H=1806, P=260, S=244)*, breed 7 (H=1627, P=289, S=244)* or breed 9 (H=1627, P=260, S=273).* <br />The <a href="/npc=25706/searing-scorchling">Searing Scorchling</a> offers only a breed 10 (H=1384, P=305, S=273)* while the <a href="/npc=16701/spirit-of-summer">Spirit of Summer</a> features a breed 3 (H=1481, P=276, S=276).* <br /><br />* - <i>(all stats are level 25, rare quality)</i></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1072085</b></h3>I managed to get one of these today, it is very powerful and took me two attempts (only because my battle was interrupted by an Enraged Earth Spirit that decided to have a pop at me!) I was using:<br /><br />Level 19 Anodized Robo-Cub (Uncommon) : 1229 Hp, 203 Power &amp; 160 Speed<br /><br />Level 20 Lava Crab (Uncommon): 1360 Hp, 204 Power &amp; 168 Speed<br /><br />Level 19 Tainted Cockroach (Rare): 1261 Hp, 195 Power &amp; 210 Speed<br /><br />The one that I caught was: <br /><br />Level 21 (reduced to Level 19 on capture) Fel Flame (Poor): 993 Hp, 152 Power &amp; 160 Speed.<br /><br />this combination of pets seemed to work well for me. Hope this helps?</div>

I did bring in shardhorn at the end of first two fights considering our second boy was almost dead when he got all of his health back. Scoot had to retreat. Hope this helps some.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>enslacked</b></h3>These guys are monsters! Three of their moves are DoTs. Paired with the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=204">Call Lightning</a> ability, can wipe out an opponent's team when you get them rolling. Great synergy, because as an elemental you are protected from the extra damage from Thunderstorm. The H/H build is the best here, as a tank while you dot them up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pipkins</b></h3>They have a frustrating habit of sticking to pools of lava that kill you/crevices too small to duel in. If you're having real problems, there are some around the base of the Hand of Gul'Dan. Not as many, but they're more likely to be on solid ground.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dzerro</b></h3>When I first came searching for these, there were none. Absolutely. Whatsoever.<br /><br />However after flying around for like 5 minutes they started spawning, and now there are plenty of them all over the place.<br /><br />So looks like they spawn when you are in the area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Imperious0212</b></h3>Can be found in Draenor in The Felblight in Tanaan Jungle as level 25.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SFFCorgi</b></h3>They're easy to find in Tanaan Jungle in the Felblight, and all the way up the mountain road to the Throne - I accidentally caught a Common H/H there. The breed information above is obviously not updated yet. The appearance is exactly the same as the ones in Outland.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Fluwijn</b></h3>Found a rare Fel Flame at 54,42.<br />Level: 23<br />Health: 1670<br />Power: 239<br />Speed: 224</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>woofpuppy</b></h3>Best place to farm these is Tanaan Jungle in Draenor. They are all level 25 and loads of them around the fel (green) areas.</div>
