After you get the first one, there is no point trying for another.\n\nIf you are on a server where there is a lot of crowding and people congregated in one spot, here are some tips:\n[ul]\n[li]Zoom all the way in (forward on your scroll-wheel), and move your cursor slowly around the area - you are looking for the egg which will have a cogwheel icon over it.\n[ul]\n[li]If you do not have a scroll wheel, the default keyboard shortcut for zooming in is Shift + '=', and zooming out is Shift + '-'.  If you play with your camera zoomed far out, you'll have to press this shortcut many times before anything seems to happen.[\/li]\n[\/ul]\n[\/li]\n[li]The egg despawns when looted, but instantly respawns.  There is a short cast time when looting.  Once you have found the egg, simply wait for a respawn and spam right-click it - eventually you will get the cast bar, and you should be able to loot it.[\/li]\n[li]If you do not have auto-loot on already, holding Shift and then right-clicking will auto-loot the pet for you.[\/li]\n[li]For those on a PvP server, especially when your faction is outnumbered, the group finder tool is very helpful.  Simply find a PvE server to switch to so you can search at your leisure.\n[ul]\n[li]It's advisable that you do this well before arriving at the cave to avoid any ganking shenanigans or painful surprises![\/li]\n[\/ul]\n[\/li]\n[li]Even if you are not switching off of a PvP server, realm hopping by using the group finder is a great way to see the egg more clearly.  When you switch realms, all players on the original server you are leaving despawn and for a brief second or two you can see the egg clearly.  Use this to your advantage to locate it.\n[ul]\n[li]Good options for groups to join via the Group Finder tool are those opening their garrisons to others for the trader\/enchanting\/pet battles, etc.[\/li]\n[\/ul]\n[\/li]\n[li]If you happen to have any, [item=44228] is a good way to deal with annoying characters standing on the egg - this item shrinks any character you apply it to!

Then you can do the following to help yourself attain this pet:\n\n1. [u]If you are [b]Alliance[\/b][\/u], and the cave is controlled by horde, make a level one Orc. Walk to Ogrimar, and take the zepplin to Borean Tundra, Northrend. In Northrend you will have to spirit-rez-walk until you are out of Warsong Hold. You will eventually rez at the Spirit Guide in Riplash Strand. From there you will spirit-rez-walk until you are past the agroing mobs, then swim to the cave entrance and loot the egg. \n\n2. [u]If you are horde[\/u], and the cave is controlled by [b]Alliance[\/b], make a level one Human. Walk to Stormwind harbor, and board the right most ship to Borean Tundra, Northrend.

Technically, (unless you are ganked), you could make it from toon creation screen to egg without ever dieing. \n\nSince the Terky pet is account bound, any character you loot the egg on will grant your non-active toons the pet. \n\nDepending on your server, and how much time the other faction is controlling the cave, toon creation for the controlling faction may be the quickest - easiest - way for you to get the pet. Especially since no one is sure yet if the egg is a limited time thing that will go away and not come back. \n\nEnjoy.","date":"2015-10-18T13:00:42-05:00","rating":13,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"For a even easier time, just create a toon on a PvE Server.","creationdate":"2015-10-20T08:53:04-05:00","id":906094,"rating":7,"commentid":2264367,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"LostThunder","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"lastEdit":["2015-10-18T13:03:21-05:00",2,"43040"]},{"commentv2":1,"number":29,"id":2264368,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Bokkie","body":"Looks like Lurky, to bad I had hoped for a different look on this one.","date":"2015-10-18T13:02:29-05:00","rating":-11,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":30,"id":2264472,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Undreadll","body":"Apparently it was added in 6.2.2, according to Jeremy Feasel's twitter, so not too long ago:\n\nJeremy Feasel â€@Muffinus\n\"6.2.2, barely lasted a month and a half.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BeerWolf</b></h3>So... seeing this pet added way back in 2.4 it's ONLY been discovered now? o.O</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jjanchan</b></h3>To obtain <a href="/npc=16445/terky">Terky</a>, what you are looking for is a white egg on the ground inside the cave that contains the <a href="/item=22780/white-murloc-egg">White Murloc Egg</a>. Don't let the pedestal with the large pearl fool you - the egg is in the pile of debris (seashells, rocks) off to the side, <b>on the ground</b>. <br /><br />Note that <a href="/npc=16445/terky">Terky</a> is unique - only 1 per account - and NOT cageable. After you get the first one, there is no point trying for another.<br /><br />If you are on a server where there is a lot of crowding and people congregated in one spot, here are some tips:<br /><ul><li>Zoom all the way in (forward on your scroll-wheel), and move your cursor slowly around the area - you are looking for the egg which will have a cogwheel icon over it.<br /><br />If you do not have a scroll wheel, the default keyboard shortcut for zooming in is Shift + '=', and zooming out is Shift + '-'. If you play with your camera zoomed far out, you'll have to press this shortcut many times before anything seems to happen.</li></ul><br /><br />The egg despawns when looted, but instantly respawns. There is a short cast time when looting. Once you have found the egg, simply wait for a respawn and spam right-click it - eventually you will get the cast bar, and you should be able to loot it.<br />If you do not have auto-loot on already, holding Shift and then right-clicking will auto-loot the pet for you.<br />For those on a PvP server, especially when your faction is outnumbered, the group finder tool is very helpful. Simply find a PvE server to switch to so you can search at your leisure.<br /><ul><li>It's advisable that you do this well before arriving at the cave to avoid any ganking shenanigans or painful surprises!</li></ul><br /><br />Even if you are not switching off of a PvP server, realm hopping by using the group finder is a great way to see the egg more clearly. When you switch realms, all players on the original server you are leaving despawn and for a brief second or two you can see the egg clearly. Use this to your advantage to locate it.<br /><ul><li>Good options for groups to join via the Group Finder tool are those opening their garrisons to others for the trader/enchanting/pet battles, etc.</li></ul><br /><br />If you happen to have any, <a href="/item=44228/baby-spice">Baby Spice</a> is a good way to deal with annoying characters standing on the egg - this item shrinks any character you apply it to! These consumable items are sometimes found in the <a href="/item=44113/small-spice-bag">Small Spice Bag</a> awarded by completing the Dalaran cooking daily. They can also be purchased in the Auction House.<br /></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>whitehusky</b></h3>If you're on a PVP server and the opposite faction is camping the spot, use the Premade Group finder to hop on a PVE server to grab it. But be courteous and choose someone who is letting people into their garrison to speak to NPCs rather than selecting someone who is forming a group for something else, like a raid, dungeon, or dailies.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>43040</b></h3><b><i><div class="quote-box">Non-Active accounts can still attain this pet with the &quot;Trial&quot; level characters (level's 1-20).</div></i><br /></b><br /><div class="quote-box"><b><i>So, you do <u>NOT</u> need to buy game time to get this pet.</i></b></div><br /><br />If you are on a PvP server, and can not do as suggested in other comments (joining a PvE group via the &quot;Finder&quot; tools). Then you can do the following to help yourself attain this pet:<br /><br />1. <u>If you are <b>Alliance</b></u>, and the cave is controlled by horde, make a level one Orc. Walk to Ogrimar, and take the zepplin to Borean Tundra, Northrend. In Northrend you will have to spirit-rez-walk until you are out of Warsong Hold. You will eventually rez at the Spirit Guide in Riplash Strand. From there you will spirit-rez-walk until you are past the agroing mobs, then swim to the cave entrance and loot the egg. <br /><br />2. <u>If you are horde</u>, and the cave is controlled by <b>Alliance</b>, make a level one Human. Walk to Stormwind harbor, and board the right most ship to Borean Tundra, Northrend. When you reach Northrend, <u>but prior to docking</u>, <i>jump off the boat and swim to the cave</i>. You should not encounter any mobs swimming to the cave. Technically, (unless you are ganked), you could make it from toon creation screen to egg without ever dieing. <br /><br />Since the Terky pet is account bound, any character you loot the egg on will grant your non-active toons the pet. <br /><br />Depending on your server, and how much time the other faction is controlling the cave, toon creation for the controlling faction may be the quickest - easiest - way for you to get the pet. Especially since no one is sure yet if the egg is a limited time thing that will go away and not come back. <br /><br />Enjoy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Undreadll</b></h3>Apparently it was added in 6.2.2, according to Jeremy Feasel's twitter, so not too long ago:<br /><br />Jeremy Feasel â€@Muffinus<br />&quot;6.2.2, barely lasted a month and a half.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MadameDarkness</b></h3>The cave is barely a cave, it's a small crack in the rock. <b>The cave is right at the tip of the island near the &quot;NS&quot; in &quot;RIPLASH RUINS&quot;.</b><br /><br />Now I can't stop clicking on her hehe :) so cute â™¥</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kartanian</b></h3>Caution: I encountered an apparent bug where finishing the entire battle with Terky's Stampede ability granted no pet XP and no post-battle hp Recovery. In this situation, the 3rd round of Stampede killed that last opponent and ended the pet battle. <br /><br />I verified this on Terky (lvl 23, 24) as I was leveling her against a couple of different kinds of PvE opponents (Rat, Fire-Proof Roach) as the last opponent in the battle.<br /><br />This may not be bugged for other pets; I haven't tested it there.
