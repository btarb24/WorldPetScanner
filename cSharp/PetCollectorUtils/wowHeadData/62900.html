They spawn friendly to Alliance, but they can still be engaged in a pet battle even if they are friendly. In addition, they show up as 'secondary battlers' in Twilight Highland combats not too uncommonly. Their appearance is identical to the purchased pet from the Blizzard store. When clicked, they make a trilling, chirring sound.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>469384</b></h3>Soo if you try going to the dwarven base where their spawn points are marked you can see the mobs, you can see the green paws above their heads but you can't interact in pet battle against them (I'm horde)<br /><br />The interesting thing is they can appear as a second mob besides the primary mob you engage in battle in any pet battle against any pet in the twilight highlands Ex: rattlesnakes, the moles( soo you get the mole first ad sometimes the gryphon will appear too in the enemy team) it seems like they have a preference to appear at that big rift in the middle of the map... don't know if that's accurate...<br /><br />Took me a lot of battles to get a rare one to spawn.. hope this info helps any hordies out there...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dragoniel</b></h3>It is possible to get it as a secondary in seemingly unrelated sub-zone. I just got one as a secondary to Twilight Spider in &quot;Twilight Breach&quot; area.<br /><br />EDIT: And it just turned out to be a rare. Paint me happy.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ickthid</b></h3>For now, it seems that Horde can only fight/tame these guys is if they're a 'guest' in a battle against a different pet. They're hostile, and if you right click or interact with them, you go into auto-attack mode.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>597835</b></h3>I only have lvld horde toons and I was lookin for an easy fix to get one of these. I had battle pets that could fight the gryphons but couldnt interact with them. So i found a nice alliance toon that taxi'd me from the dwarf starting area to Twilight Highlands and dropped me off at Thundermar. I got dismounted a couple times for some reason but made it. The one that spawns in the basement of the building in Kirkhaven kept saying &quot;ground is to uneven&quot; or &quot;battle area obstructed&quot; so I couldnt get to that one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>UlarnekIronclaw</b></h3>A tip for anyone farming these. Yes there will be friendly ones spawned all the time, but if you wait a bit a battle-able one will spawn! Don't worry be patient!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>815393</b></h3>They can be found as secondary pets in battles in the area around Kirthhaven for horde characters. A small sample of pet battles in the area showed me a rate of 5 in 12 pet battles had the Wildhammer Gryphon Hatchling as a secondary pet. Just roam the area killing non battle critters until you find ones to battle. Remember to kill the Highland Worg in the area as well, as they kill critters. Do fly overs of the gryphon hatching area, as they will spawn there as well, but horde can not battle them, so just kill them if you are horde. I found a few as secondary pets in battles in the ledge areas just outside of Kirthaven. <br /><br />Alliance characters can just kill critters until one spawns in the gryphon hatching area in kirthaven.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1044793</b></h3>My experience w/ this lil bugger.....I'm a die hard horde and have no alliance toons what so ever. So, after an hour and a half of trying to make the hatchling spawn as a secondary battle pet w/ no luck, I made a lvl 1 dwarf and thought it would be a good idea to run there....WRONG. Thankfully a guildee had an alliance toon high enough to fly me there w/ a double seater flying mount. I logged off this alliance toon since there weren't any spawned and was going to try on my horde toon to make them spawn. I can say that after an hr and a half of farming, logging out and running there on an alliance toon and logging back on the horde toon, one spawned as a secondary battle pet! D:<br /><br />My advice to the horde is to not give up and battle every single pet in that zone till u get it. Unless you know for a fact someone has an alliance toon and can escort you there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MinionOfCthulhu</b></h3>Something to note is that while it looks just like the gryphon hatchling from the Blizzard Store, it won't fly when you mount up on a flying mount.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1044730</b></h3>Wildhammer Gryphon Hatchling are the second and third spawn (randomly) from any battle-pet in the area.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PoshKenneth</b></h3>Say what you will about finding a nice alliance person to ferry your level one, but...<br /><br />As a horde girl who was sick of trying to find a secondary pet, I hopped on to a long abandoned Alliance Paladin. Level 27, no guild = slowest possible mount speed.<br /><br />Got the flightpath to Greenwarden's Grove, marched through the damn Dragonmaw Gates like a badass, and hugged the edge all the way to Thundermar.<br /><br />ONE Twilight dude started chasing me but even my slow ass mount outran him.<br /><br />Not a single corpse run.<br /><br />SO yes getting a ferry would be a lot easier but I highly reccommend doing this if you want to feel like a god amongst mortals!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>pmakaro</b></h3>I am wondering if Alliance have pets that they can't get as primary because they are stationed in Horde bases. This is the second pet that I have found that is stationed in Aliiance bases. The other is the <a href="/npc=62648/turkey">Turkey</a>. At least <a href="/npc=62648/turkey">Turkey</a> can be battled you just need some stealth to get to them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mschristieb</b></h3>I have been hunting for a rare hatchling for a while, I had one at one point but once it hit 25 it down graded to uncommon quality (GM's say its a bug). So back to the highlands I go in my search. I have killed every battle pet in the area of thundermar and kirthaven and can say they also drop as secondary pets from turkeys, yellow bellied marmots, twilight spiders, and highland skunks. Hope this helps and that you guys dont run into the same problems i've had with the quality changes.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ozlem</b></h3>How to get that one in the basement.<br />EDIT: Ok I apologize for not naming what basement as there is only one Wildhammer Gryphon Hatchling that is stuck in one basement and that basement is located at Kirthaven like user Kodiak393 helpfully answered in the replies below (+1 form me for answering, thank you!) As there was the only one in that basement that bugs I just assumed readers would know the one I was talking about and for that assumption I apologize. I'm happy to read this has helped players out, was driving me crazy I couldn't reach it. <br /><br />1.Open Game Menu<br />2.Click Key Bindings <br />3. Scroll through list until you find &quot;Targeting Functions&quot; title. Look for &quot;interact with target&quot; (it's below Interact with mouseover.)<br />4. Bind a key to 'Interact with target' (you do that by clicking on the first 'not bound' then hitting the key you wish to bind, I use F8 personally.<br />5. Once key is bound head into basement and target the pet.<br />6. Run outside and hit your 'interact with target' bound key. (if doesn't work keep moving around over the pet until it works.)<br /><br />Voila that's how you get that one stuck in the basement.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Znaleziatko</b></h3>This one is so cute! To sum it up - it really is simple to obtain even for <b>Horde</b>.<br /><br />Went on my Horde toon to Twilight Highlands. I circled around Kirthaven and then just started battling pets in the area. First battle (scorpid) - an uncommon gryphon hatchling came as <b>secondary</b>. Second battle (yellow-bellied marmot) - a <b>rare</b> gryphon!<br /><br />Horde for Life!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>jenbabe13</b></h3>I just wanted to encourage my fellow battle pet seekers (especially those of us who are obsessed with the rare forms of our battle pets) to KEEP TRYING! After hours of looking for a rare of this pet, I finally found it just before I thought I'd lose my mind. DON'T GET DISCOURAGED!<br /><br />I think it's important to note that even on an alliance toon, I made sure to engage all battle pets I saw in the entire zone of Twilight Highlands. As mentioned before, the hatchling often appears as a secondary battle pet in fights with all of the other battle pets in the entire zone, and this is actually how I finally got my rare. It was worth it though! This guy is adorable and in my main battle team now.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>marycha90</b></h3>Found it next to The Black Breach, coords 60/30, fighted with scorpid nd he was 2nd. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lartoon</b></h3>While in the area of Bastion of Twilight in Twilight Highlands, went into a pet battle with a random cockroach. Saw that it was teamed up with a rare <a href="/npc=62900/wildhammer-gryphon-hatchling">Wildhammer Gryphon Hatchling</a>. The cockroaches first move was Apocalypse. The gryphon was the last in the group. While trying to cage the gryphon, apocalypse hit and failed. Luckily, I captured my gryphon and did a /happy dance. :p This warlock is a proud Horde so good luck and happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Saronai</b></h3>These guys come in three sizes. It's not obvious unless you see more than one at the same time (or summon different sizes in a row). The sizes appear to be small (runty), medium, and large. I performed multiple comparisons in the same positions and distance on four different ones, a poor, common, uncommon, and rare (the former two were the same size). The medium and large sizes are close enough that the difference can be really hard to notice, but the runt is adorable.<br /><br />Initially, my tames' size increased with their quality, but I have since spotted many common and poor quality gryphons of each size while hunting for a highland mouse. In short, the size and quality do not seem dependent on each other.<br /><br />Nothing too important of note, but if you can be a little girlish (like me) the tiny guy is sooo much cuter &lt;3 I've always had a soft spot for runts.<br /><br />Edit to add: I've encountered a few rares, they're always the same size (the largest size), not enough to say for sure if the rares are always big or if it is merely coincidence though.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>knugen</b></h3>Horde are unable to capture these unless they find one as a secondary pet as they're alliance only. I tried to engage one on my horde character but was unable to. Then I went on my alliance one and was fully capeable of capturing one. Horde are only able to capture these as a secondary pet so if you see one in the wild, don't bother engaging it or you will auto-attack it and maybe even kill it. Either take an alliance character there and battle with one of them or simply battle other pets to try and find one as secondary.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mewmewface</b></h3>Having a level 85 alliance toon, I thought this wasn't going to be a problem. I saw the hatchling was tameable on my horde server but I accidentally killed it trying to interact with it .Oops.<br /><br />So I went on my alliance toon and went to the flightmaster in Kirkhaven but I didnt see any hatchlings there. It is kind of rare to see them there, but not as impossible as Minfernal.<br /><br />I battled a few pets and I came back to the FP and one spawned, uncommon.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Faevel13</b></h3>For anyone that is Horde and trying to obtain one of these adorable battle pets, you don't have to go too far out of your way to try and get one of these. I stopped to do a few pet battles in Twilight Highlands and nab up a Highlands Mouse for an achievement, and during some of my pet battles I've come across several Wildhammer Gryphon Hatchlings. I'm actually staring one down right now. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mathalor</b></h3>After having farmed this, I felt like leaving a few comments.<br /><br />First, if you're going for a specific breed, probably p/p, don't bother farming for a rare, just grab the first you find and stone it.<br /><br />Second, farming that specific breed took me an afternoon. I found two spawn points, both right next to the alliance flight paths, both heavily camped. I took to killing other pets and hoping for a griffon to pop up, but they don't join up nearly as frequently as snakes, spiders, marmots, etc. When I couldn't stand it anymore, and after leveling several pets to 25, I started retreating from anything that didn't have something that I wanted, and casting shadow word pain at it so it'd respawn as something else. Still took me a while doing that, but I eventually found my p/p griffon, retreated, healed, and went back in for the capture. I'll stone it when I can.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, if you don't feel like being there for days, kill the trash you don't need.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>echroll</b></h3>I was lucky enough to get a rare from a random pet battle in the zone, but the ones i have seen at the two regular spawn points, somehow i can't battle them, i only get an attack icon. I wonder if this can have anything to do with phasing, as i haven't done any quests in the zone. Anybody knows?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mzp1994</b></h3>Finally captured a rare one of these. Farmed them a bit and tried to battle the ones that were spawning around the two villages Kirhaven and Thundermar, but didn't find any that were higher than uncommon. Then i battled one of the other pets in the area and finally found one - i'm so happy :D <br />Think i battled between 5 and 10 before i found a rare. I found it as 2nd battle pet in a battle with a Yellow-Bellied Marmot. Hope this info somehow helps :)</div>

Sure enough around 75% of the Fiendlings I fought had a Hatchling in tow. Caught a Poor P/P on the first try.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kafros</b></h3>If you're not having any luck finding one as a secondary, just go around obsidian forest (black area at the bottom left of the map) - though not inside. Every pet battle i went in had a hatchling as a secondary (check 4-5 battles to find a good breed).<br /><br />Keep a critter killer handy for the roaches and mice and a pet with an attack that won't kill the hatchling to make sure you catch it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>89813</b></h3>I had issues so I went to get the Twilight Fiendling east of Thundermar (and there's plenty) and found the Wildhammer Gryphon as well as Highlands Mouse, Highlands Skunk, Water Snake, Black Rat, Cockroach and Yellow-Bellied Marmot as secondary battles. Easy way to get 7 pets in one area. The Wildhammer Gryphon showed up about every 5-6 battles. Uploading screenshot.</div>

As others have stated, they do come in as secondary pets and that is how I captured mine.<br /><br />As a Horde player, I grabbed my Alliance mage and went over there.

Five or six hatchlings were scattered around the flightpath NPC - all friendly, but none with the green paw icon. At some point the game disconnected, and when I logged in again, one of the hatchlings now had the green paw / could be engaged, and I immediately tamed it. Good luck to all!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nehel</b></h3>Found rare one as secondary while fighting rattlesnake</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1573758</b></h3>these are very common as secondary pets all around the NE plateau area of Twilight Highlands. Don't wait for a rare, just start popping everything you see. One will surely show.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sailorstarfairy</b></h3>Just snagged this guy - didn't have to wait around or anything so I figured be good idea to share time/date/sever name for those who might need the info:<br /><br />Tuesday 9:55 pm MST on Shadow Council Server. He was literally right in front of the flight master. <br /><br />I was a little bummed when I realized he would shrink to half the size of the other babies in the area once he was tamed. Also had to use my Flawless Flying Battle Stone to get him to blue, but I figure he's worth it :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jouninz</b></h3>Couldn't interact with the ones close to the flight master. Not as Horde, not as Alliance.<br /><br />Got one as secondary fighting other random pets instead.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>RevyChan</b></h3>It's really cute *O*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>xylotism</b></h3>I couldn't find any on my Horde character and on Alliance the only one that was battle-able was in the basement that's too small to start a pet battle. Huge waste of time in my case, my advice is to find something similar that's easier to tame.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bomigabster</b></h3>Lots around the Kirthaven FP that I couldn't engage with, tried logging out and back in as someone suggested but it made no difference. Also found the one in the basement someone mentioned where the battle field is obstructed so that was also a waste (I bet that guy is a blue, ha).<br />Circled the mountain and eventually found a grey as a secondary to a rattlesnake.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>blus10</b></h3>I got one by battling a Highlands Skunk...it was the 3rd pet that joined the battle....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gmanv2</b></h3>Found 3 of them, including an uncommon, by the Gryphon Master for Thundermar.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Okkulto</b></h3>Well if you are horde and trying to get one, it is rather easy. Just keep fighting Twilight Fiendlings, they are 2nd pet in that group most of the time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ne0nguy</b></h3><b>Horde Tip:</b><br /><br />I got 2 rare <a href="/npc=62900/wildhammer-gryphon-hatchling">Wildhammer Gryphon Hatchling</a>s as a secondary while trying to get a rare <a href="/npc=154803/twilight-whelpling">Twilight Whelpling</a>.<br />The Whelpling are in a relatively small section. When you run out, just use a /target macro to find and kill all the non pet-battle versions to force more to respawn.<br />/cleartarget<br />/tar Twilight<br />/script i = 8; if UnitCreatureType(&quot;target&quot;) == &quot;Wild Pet&quot; then i = 4; end; SetRaidTarget(&quot;target&quot;,i);<br />This macro targets the nearest whelping and marks it with an arrow if it's a battle pet and a skull if it's not.<br /><br />Edit: I wrote this before realizing there are no wild rare Twilight Whelplings, but it's still a good alternative to catch the Gryphons so I'll leave this post up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>undrinkable</b></h3>Trying to find one of these for the achievement, finally had the ones in Kirthaven popup with the green paw symbol, but as Horde, my only option is to kill them, I cannot fight them. I have yet to find one as a secondary to any battle I've done so far.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lampy</b></h3>A lot of the comments on this page are outdated.<br /><br />Getting this pet is easy for both factions because the pet is common secondary pet in the zone.<br /><br />Getting a rare one is hard. <br /><br />Alliance players can try their luck on the spawns in Thundermar or Kirthaven, but there is only few of them that you can battle and the respawn time is long.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PlaysWoW</b></h3>Got one on the first pet battle I did in this area with a Lvl 106 Demon Hunter. It came as a secondary pet as I was leveling pets during the Pet Battle Bonus Event on the calendar. According to forum user <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/user=Whiterock">Whiterock</a> the recommended breeds seem to be P/P and S/S</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>vortha</b></h3>As soon as I was close to the flight point at Kirthhaven, a gryphon hatching showed up on the mini map, atop the mountain by the flight point. Turned out to be green. Got that one, and the next pet on the peak included a green as the secondary. Flew around the area of the flight point and found three other greens. Right on the ground by the flight point picked up another green. No blues but green is good enough for the achievement.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Banana8008</b></h3><b>If you're trying to capture this pet at the spawn points shown on the map of this post, you must be an Alliance character. Horde cannot interact with it to pet battle!</b> You can however capture as Horde/Alliance as a 2nd or 3rd pet according to other wowhead comments. I did not have that luck.<ul><li><i>After trying both Horde &amp; Alliance characters on different PvE servers to see if the pet would be up at the spawn points (at Kirthaven FP &amp; 48.4, 28.6), they were always friendly as a non-battle pet (could not kill on either faction) and were never a battle pet. I then tried multiple different locations in the wowhead comments below to no avail. I could not get this pet to appear as a 2nd or 3rd battle pet within the zone after over an hour of trying (killing each pet after I forfeited when I didn't see Wildhammer Gryphon Hatchling as a 2nd or 3rd battle pet).</i> </li></ul> <br /><br /><b>What worked for me: </b> As most rare mounts I've obtained, I decided to try my luck on an RP server. Sure enough, there was 1 spawned on my Alliance character at the Kirthaven FP! If you don't see it up on your server, try an RP server if you have a character on 1 of them. <br /><br /><i>If you don't have a character on an RP server: See if a friend has an Alliance character on an RP server to help phase you to their server, or see if a friend wouldn't mind creating a trial character to phase you to a RP server!</i> <b>Happy Hunting!</b> :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MaxWilder</b></h3>After attacking many wild pets around Kirthaven, I finally found a group with a Gryphon Hatchling in the back line on top of the mountain just to the east of Kirthaven.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aerri</b></h3>Ok so the information that I found here was slightly dated and a little ambiguous. So, as of 9.1 I found the Wildhammer Gryphon Hatchling as a secondary pet in three different battles around the Thundermar area. Look around the borders of the area, not in the town proper. There are a bunch of little npc non-interactable hatchlings in the town as well as in Kirthaven. All I found for ratings was two poor and one common. I do not really care as I am out for the Safari achievement and I have plenty of stones to raise the quality. I hope this helps! <br /><br />Also, considering the locations I found them in, you can do this as either faction. If you are Horde just be mindful of town borders, but for the most part there should be no problems getting this done. The last one I found was at 46/29 and it is well outside of the town.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>KhadgarIsca</b></h3>Collected one this morning at 8.45a EST on Alleria.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>barneystrife</b></h3>The only hope for a horde toon to get one of these is 1. Make an ally toon and go get one, or 2. Get into a pet battle with other nearby pets in the area and there is a chance of getting the gryphon as one of the other pets to join in the battle. I did #2 within 3 attempts. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>nemaele</b></h3>If you're Horde, don't try to battle the Gryphon pet if it spawns - you'll just end up killing it.<br />To get it, I flew around Kirthaven. I got a Gryphon as a secondary pet on the third try when fighting the other pets in town.</div>
