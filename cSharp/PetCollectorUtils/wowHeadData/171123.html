<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AthenaP</b></h3>I have been here an hour and have yet to see a single spawn. I've looked before and after finishing the wq.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>geekygirlish</b></h3>This is going to be the one that is hard to get for the ach, I can feel it! I did find two, it is also one of those that kills itself, a bit like the unborn Val'kyr. Didn't notice and the first one blew itself up. Found a second in Waynecrypt Hill cemetery, it was obstructed so I followed it around spamming interact on it. Finally found some free space and it was a rare and didn't blow itself up! Happy days.<br />ETA This is also pre wq as I don't have them yet<br />EETA Got the ach and yes, this one was the hardest one to find, the rest are very straightforward. There's always one!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Globegnome</b></h3>The ability <a href="/pet-ability=652/haunt">Haunt</a> only makes the pet <i>temporarily</i> dead, you don't need to abandon the fight if you get it. Just wait for four turns, kill the other pets in the meanwhile, and then capture the Lost Soul when the Haunt ends.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>pmff</b></h3>Found one (uncommon) today after a while of waiting (still probably &lt;20 min) at 48, 75 with no WQ in the area. Definitely recommend grabbing this one whether you find a rare or not if you find it! It definitely appears to be the rarest in the zone, at least.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sirloper</b></h3>mine was up first try at 50, 71. One thing worth noting: I accidentally killed it at first (whoops!) but surrendered on its immortal round and IT WAS STILL THERE! So good news for those that f it up like I did.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dianora</b></h3>There's no World Quest in the zone. I check Night's Market and Banewood twice with no result. Just on a larke, I went back north to Menagerie of the Master outside of Sanguine Depths and found one. It would appear that only one Lost Soul is up in the zone at any given time.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dgnuff</b></h3>This combination made the capture incredibly easy, despite the Lost Soul's Haunt ability.<br /><br />1: Emerald Proto-Whelp 2/2/2 I used P/P, but other breeds should work<br />2: Albatross Hatchling X/1/X Only comes in B/B according to Battle Pet Breed ID<br />3. Hyjal Wisp X/X/1 Only comes in S/S according to Battle Pet Breed ID<br /><br />General Strategy:<br /><br />Let the Lost Soul Haunt your EPW, and then use Emerald Presence and Emerald Dream to heal through the damage.<br />Switch to the Albatross the round the Lost Soul rezzes, and use Wind Buffet. That forces the Lost Soul back to the front line. Switch back to your EPW.<br />Repeat till the damage taken by casting Haunt causes the Lost soul to fall below 35%<br />Try and catch it, you probably won't succeed the first time.<br />Rinse and repeat till you do catch it.<br />Clean up with the EPW, using the Wisp as an &quot;OhMiGosh&quot; pet if you need a monster heal on someone.<br />Profit.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cronah</b></h3>I just caught this one around 50, 75 (south of the map). If I'm not mistaken it seems to share the spawns with the Rosetipped Spiderling, I just kept killing the Rosetipped Spiderling until the lost soul spawned. This was much quicker than running around. No WQ was active in this area, I believe the WQ part is misinformation.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Madja</b></h3>While he does indeed seem to be zone unique as in there's only one up in the zone at a time he also seems to have an instant respawn as I just captured one and another popped 50 yards away, so don't worry too much if someone else got him before you.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>GamBeaT</b></h3>There can be multiple Lost Souls up at the same time, they are just very rare to find</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Volleynova</b></h3>It was harder for me to find than the others, but I finally got mine at 49, 33 in Revendreth, below the stairs at the Menagerie of the Master.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lantokk</b></h3>Has anybody seen Lost Soul spawn as secondary or tertiary pet? I have not, though I've been checking a lot, especially in the Banewood.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>VikToLive</b></h3>I found three up, simultaneously, by the Menagerie of the Master. World quest was not up. It was 11pm server time; it's possible the spawns are night/day specific, as I hadn't seen any up there previously during the day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wyo1</b></h3>used realm hopping even though i hate it but it worked</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>GoblinMari</b></h3>If you're having trouble with the Lost Soul haunting while it's the last pet and killing itself you can flee from battle and re-enter until it has the &quot;Haunting Song&quot; ability instead of the &quot;Haunt&quot; ability. Took a few tries but it eventually worked for me, just make sure to watch your pet health as you do it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>willowbird</b></h3>Saw one randomly while fishing in the Grove of Terror, at 50 77, down near the Black Market AH and where you turn in those random drop items. Grey quality, but I have the upgrade item, so I caught it (not something I normally do.) Glad I did now that I see they're rare and I'm just starting to work on filling out my Shadowlands pet roster.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mefiles</b></h3>Just found mine at 51 , 35 , WQ was in fact ocurring</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mEtalio</b></h3>around 52 , 76 no WQ there</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SoliloquyChrysei</b></h3>These guys spawn around Wanecrypt hill/ Court of the Harvesters area, and around the Black Market AH. They also spawn in a couple of locations in Menagerie of the Master, but it's riddled with adds (WQ was up, please advise if this is all the time). <br /><br />Get the addon REMATCH, it tells you the spawn locations and makes it alot easier to get pets all over the world.<br /><br />I still haven't gotten a rare, but I've been running around the Wanecrypt / Court of the Harvesters / BMAH and saw them a bunch of times. I think they share spawns with the Rosetipped Spiderling, so just kill the ones you don't need and keep running around. That's what I am doing.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>nikoprophet</b></h3>Found one of these at 51, 78</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MorrigahnYsera</b></h3>Found a green at 48.74, 76.33 as primary. No WQ at the location. Kept checking and killing the spiders in case it was a backline, showed up after 15 mins or so in an area I had already been through. Good Luck to you!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dreamgarden</b></h3>NPCScan ID: 171123<br />I killed a few Rosetipped Spiderlings (Initiate battle and check for Rares first). Lost Soul appeared about 10 minutes after I started doing that.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LeeTheShark</b></h3>I think it's worth noting that they don't seem to spawn in both locations at one time - so if you don't see any around Wanecrypt Hill, try up by the Menagerie of the Master, and vice versa.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dalylah</b></h3>I found mine at 50.42, 79.07 in The Night Market in Revendreth, right next to a carriage.<br /><br />/way 50.42 79.07</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>VictorVolts</b></h3>If you have a pet that can dodge e.g: anubisath idol you can attack once and then dodge because the lost soul will cast haunt on the second cast and it won't kill itself and you have to bring the pet down to 35% so abubisath idol is really good because of sandstorm ability and you can capture pet, if you can't grab it just surrender and do it again eventually you'll get it</div>
