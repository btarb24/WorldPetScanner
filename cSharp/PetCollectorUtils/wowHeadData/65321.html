(In case you're wondering why my other pet died too, no, I'm not a noob, I just sort of lost interest in swapping and winning the fight when I realized I won't grab the hatchling anyway anymore...)\n\nI really, really hope this won't happen to you guys. It was really frustrating, and I haven't found another Crimson since (I get tons of Jade and Golden, but no Crimson :\/ ), let alone a rare one. Yes, RNG is a %^&*! and stuff like this can happen. So once it casts Scorched Earth be very careful not to hit it anymore or hope your trap will catch it. That's what I did but it still didn't work out... The few rounds did the job (he cast it right before his HP was low enough to catch him) and that damn trap kept missing. Oh well... Back to killing moths and frogs.\n\nEdit: Yeah, I forgot to add that you can cancel it out with another weather effect, but then you risk killing it with the initial damage from that effect. So pick whichever you have most faith in. Hopefully, it won't happen to you.\n\nEdit 2: To make things clear, at the time of writing this post (5.1), there was no way to reset a battle if you wanted to. During 5.0, logging out worked to reset, so there was no issue, and in 5.2 forfeiting will automatically reset the battle without making the pet disappear from the wild, thankfully. However, since the initial post I have discovered that queuing up for PVP (Arena or BG) and entering a battle during a pet battle WILL reset the fight AND keep the wild pet alive and available as of 5.1. That's how I finally got my Crimson rare (killed itself again, but I had discovered this way around it by mistake during Arenas, thankfully, so I could just reset him and grab him on a second go, deserter debuff and all.)\n\nGood luck guys!","date":"2013-01-03T09:24:09-06:00","rating":16,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Had pretty much this exact same thing happen.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>QuickBASIC</b></h3>It's worth noting that the <a href="/npc=65324/wild-golden-hatchling">Wild Golden Hatchling</a> and <a href="/npc=65323/wild-jade-hatchling">Wild Jade Hatchling</a> have identical movesets, whereas the <a href="/npc=65321/wild-crimson-hatchling">Wild Crimson Hatchling</a> has a <s>unique</s> different moveset.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>272303</b></h3>These guys can be quite a pain if you don't have a level 25 pet to start battling these. They got lightning and fire weather and can fly up in order to avoid all damage. Finding a rare seems tough, did 28 battles, all I saw were some green ones.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>161597</b></h3><b>Quick info on the Cloud Serpent Hatchlings:</b><br /><br />While they might not seem different they actually all have different attributes. Making them suitable for different strategies.<br /><br /><ul><li>The Wild Jade Hatchling has the highest base <b>Health</b>.</li><li>The Wild Crimson Hatchling has the highest base <b>Speed</b>.</li><li>The Wild Golden Hatchling has the highest base <b>Power</b>.</li></ul><br /><br />In addition to that the Crimson Hatchling has a unique moveset with more dragon focussed abilities. While the Golden and Jade Hatchling have the same moveset.<br /><br />I actually managed to catch a 24 rare crimson hatchling, was quite a challenge since all my pets where lower level. Also managed to get the Jade hatchling as rare, the golden one is still eluding me.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>NeinnaWR</b></h3>I was bummed to find out that while they have Jade and Golden, they don't have the third mount's color, Azure. Perhaps the now easy to get Celestial dragon will have to work.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kyokushinkai</b></h3>I had been looking for these pets for several days and managed to only find 1 or 2 spawns at a time; sometimes none at all. One day it was raining and these guys were literally everywhere. They were even respawning every few minutes as I made my rounds. If you want to collect these awesome little pets, go when it rains!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>NeoAnimus</b></h3>Spent a little bit farming a rare for each color and here's the trick I found to get them. First, they are a pretty common spawn everywhere in the arboretum. Second, they share a spawn with the stupid little garden frogs there, so if they are not spawning kill the frogs. In fact if you are not seeing any then just go around killing the critters in the area and they will show up. Third, you cannot kill the dragons nor make them go away without engaging them in a pet battle, so if you are waiting for a particular color then just keep going into battle with them and then run away and the color you want will spawn soon enough. It took me an hour of doing this and I got a rare in all three colors.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>183742</b></h3>It took a LOT of battles to finally get a rare to come up. My first rare was the Crimson one and it nearly killed itself with it's scorched earth ability before I could capture it. In a super lucky twist, my very next battle was a rare Jade.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Aliandrin</b></h3>From what I've seen, my analysis of the Crimson is thus:<br /><br />The Crimson is the easiest to find, and the easiest to get in rare quality. (I went through three rare Crimsons before coming upon a rare golden, and I was only battling the Crimsons to get rid of them.)<br /><br />The Crimson is the least valuable as a pokemon. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=172">Scorched Earth</a> is only any good to an elemental-type, because it won't harm them, while Jade and Golden have <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=204">Call Lightning</a> instead, a much more valuable move with numerous ways to milk its already good utility.<br /><br />That said, the Crimson does have a decent heal, while the other two do not. It also has <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=169">Deep Breath</a>, and you generally want stronger moves, even if they take an extra turn to use. (This is because you end up getting more damage this way; one big hit with all your eggs in it is reduced less by shield effects and is just all-around better damage than spreading your eggs thin into multiple baskets.)<br /><br />Still, the small recompenses of a heal and Deep Breath don't really make up for the loss of Call Lightning.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>327600</b></h3>A comment about spawn times.<br /><br />I was farming these for a while looking for rares in the early morning hours, 5-7AM server (around 5 is when I arrived in the Arboretum, so I don't know if they were there before then). They were everywhere. They respawned very quickly after fights, and also as I was killing the non-dragon critters. Once it hit 7AM server they disappeared. I hung around killing more critters to see if any more dragons spawned and never saw any.<br /><br />Can anyone confirm if they have or have not seen them in the morning?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LeeShu</b></h3>All wild cloud serpent pets spawn only day time. I camped yesterday between 3 and 6 am realm time and killed all the frogs and moth pets to make it spawn faster but i couldn't find any wild cloud serpent. Today i logged in at 3 pm realm time and it was full of them, in 1 hour i farmed a rare for every color.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>natey87</b></h3>It may be of some benefit, if you have the patience, to engage the multitudes of Garden Moths and Garden Frogs in this area, in pet battles, rather than simply blasting them with your toon. There is always the chance that a secondary or tertiary spawn of a pet you didn't previously have will arrive too. Maybe something to add to your collection, or possibly an upgrade for you rare hunters. The spawns i've seen include:- <br /><br />Jungle Darter <br />Leopard Tree Frog <br />Silkbead Snail <br />Temple Snake <br />Jumping Spider <br />Masked Tanuki <br />Masked Tanuki Pup <br />Emerald Turtle <br />Sandy Petrel <br />Spirebound Crab <br />Shrine Fly <br />Mirrorstrider <br />Grove Viper <br /><br />So maybe you'll find something you weren't looking for. However, the Wild Hatchlings will only spawn as primary pets, so fire away if that's all your roster requires.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>puffcake</b></h3>Please bear in mind that these CAN and MIGHT kill themselves with Scorched Earth.<br /><br />SS: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/uqm2h.jpg?1" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/uqm2h.jpg?1</a><br /><br />This happened to the first Crimson I found, it was a rare, I was extremely happy, then it killed itself with the ability. (In case you're wondering why my other pet died too, no, I'm not a noob, I just sort of lost interest in swapping and winning the fight when I realized I won't grab the hatchling anyway anymore...)<br /><br />I really, really hope this won't happen to you guys. It was really frustrating, and I haven't found another Crimson since (I get tons of Jade and Golden, but no Crimson :/ ), let alone a rare one. Yes, RNG is a %^&amp;*! and stuff like this can happen. So once it casts Scorched Earth be very careful not to hit it anymore or hope your trap will catch it. That's what I did but it still didn't work out... The few rounds did the job (he cast it right before his HP was low enough to catch him) and that damn trap kept missing. Oh well... Back to killing moths and frogs.<br /><br />Edit: Yeah, I forgot to add that you can cancel it out with another weather effect, but then you risk killing it with the initial damage from that effect. So pick whichever you have most faith in. Hopefully, it won't happen to you.<br /><br />Edit 2: To make things clear, at the time of writing this post (5.1), there was no way to reset a battle if you wanted to. During 5.0, logging out worked to reset, so there was no issue, and in 5.2 forfeiting will automatically reset the battle without making the pet disappear from the wild, thankfully. However, since the initial post I have discovered that queuing up for PVP (Arena or BG) and entering a battle during a pet battle WILL reset the fight AND keep the wild pet alive and available as of 5.1. That's how I finally got my Crimson rare (killed itself again, but I had discovered this way around it by mistake during Arenas, thankfully, so I could just reset him and grab him on a second go, deserter debuff and all.)<br /><br />Good luck guys!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Znaleziatko</b></h3>After five days of daily visits to the Arboretum I finally have my three rares - the Wild Crimson Hatchling was the last one to catch. From what I've observed the Jade Hatchlings are most common (I've seen couple of rares), then there are the Golden Hatchlings (two rares) and I came across only one rare Crimson Hatchling.<br /><br />I have a tip for all of you rare-hunters - don't even bother trying to catch anything from the Jade Forest before spending your time on those three hatchlings. They have many different secondaries. In the proccess of catching rare hatchlings I also got my <b>rare</b> version of: <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=65215">Garden Moth</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63004">Grove Viper</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63919">Leopard Tree Frog</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63715">Jumping Spider</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62997">Jungle Darter</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62994">Emerald Turtle</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63006">Sandy Petrel</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62998">Mirror Strider</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=63005">Spirebound Crab</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62999">Temple Snake</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=65216">Shrine Fly</a>.<br /><br />Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pfenix</b></h3>People talk about risking low health in their target to change weather condition to cancel scorched earth effect......certain pets healing ability causes cleansing rain which will also change weather effect and not damage your target!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Karsciyin</b></h3>When trying to catch this particular pet, don't put its health too low. If you've got it sitting at 40%, wait for the inevitable - it will eventually cast Scorched Earth, to which it is not immune (only Elementals are). This slow suicide could cost you your rare if you're not careful!<br /><br />Alternatively, bring a pet with its own weather effect. The Terrible Turnip may be favoured not only for its signature move, Weakening Blow, but also for the 'Sunny Day' weather effect, which will negate Scorched Earth (be wary that this move also does a small amount of damage to the entire team). If you're looking for something simple, all frogs and toads will have cleansing rain at the time they're high enough level to fight this guy - a weather effect without damage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ryusan</b></h3>I'm still waiting for Blizzard to allow us to get Wild Azure Hatchling...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Steakfajita</b></h3>The Crimson Hatchling has the same set of skills as the Onyxian Whelpling. Just in case anyone wanted to know.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rezzelyn</b></h3>I couldn't see any of the hatchlings the same day that I received my mount. So, if you keep killing Garden Frogs and nothing appears except more frogs, my advice is to <b>look for hatchlings tomorrow</b>. <br /><br />I received my mount around 2pm server time, and wasted the rest of my day killing critter frogs and battling Garden Frogs, no hatchlings were appearing. There were very few players around too, so I knew that other people were not beating me to them. <br /><br />At midnight (server time) suddenly tons of hatchlings came out. I woke up today, and there are still tons of hatchlings everywhere. I think it just takes time for the game to respond and allow you to see them. I'm reading accounts of other people having this happen to them as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Enthorn</b></h3>Take note of its ability <a href="/pet-ability=172/scorched-earth">Scorched Earth</a>. It will kill itself if you're trying to capture it and you're not careful. I lost two of them this way, one of which was a rare. Cry ;-/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hiaran</b></h3>It's description &quot;It's red, so it must fly faster&quot; is probably an easter egg of the Warhammer universe where orcs believe (and they believe turns real) that all what's red is faster then normal (like a red painted ship flying faster then a ship that's not red even when they are of the same kind and should have the same speed).</div>
