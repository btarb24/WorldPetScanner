So only the breeds distinguish the battle value of the fully trained snails.\n\nIt has also been pointed out that the snails are slow, and that even the S\/S lags other battle pets, so speed is a throw-away stat.\n\nSince you have no choice with Scooter, you get an H\/H, avoiding the throw-away stat. The downside of Scooter is he starts as a level 1 uncommon. All of the rest can be caught as a rare.\n\nThe Shimmershell Snail is available as an H\/H, an H\/P, and a B\/B. Avoiding B\/B because of low numbers, some wasted on speed, the H\/H is attractive, but you already have that covered with Scooter. The H\/P is unique among the snails, so is probably the better choice.

There is a good chance these will be the first snails you get to level 25.\n\nThe Rapana Whelk is available as an S\/S, an H\/B, and a B\/B. Per the choice for Rusty Snail breed, among these last two snails, the H\/B is the strongest.\n\nThe Silkbead Snail is only available as an H\/S and a B\/B.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>schtinky</b></h3>The Rapana Whelk has a very, very slow baseline. Even the S/S breed is only 260 speed, meaning it will still be slower than 90% of the pets you fight, including probably ALL of the epics and legendaries in the Pandaria dailies. (The S/S breed will be faster than some P/P, H/P and H/H pets (like Anubisath idol), but they are few and far between.)<br /><br />So if it's almost always slower than the competition, you're better off with the breed that has the least itemization points into Speed. That is, the H/B breed.</div>

So only the breeds distinguish the battle value of the fully trained snails.<br /><br />It has also been pointed out that the snails are slow, and that even the S/S lags other battle pets, so speed is a throw-away stat.<br /><br />Since you have no choice with Scooter, you get an H/H, avoiding the throw-away stat.
