Note that there are none in the pink bubble places. There's a stable master at Area 52, so I've been staying close around there and finding one here and there easily enough. They're level 19. While they're wild, they will fly up high in the sky, so if you see one on ur minimap, but it's not on the ground, look up. You can still battle them while they're up high as long as they're still in range obviously.<br /><br />Other rare pet in the area (so far that I have found) is the Nether Roach.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>21278</b></h3>They showed up for me about 11:00 p.m. server time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>adashiel</b></h3>Unlike the <a href="/npc=28470/nether-ray-fry">Nether Ray Fry</a>, the Fledgling Nether Ray can't actually fly. If you take off on a flying mount with it out, it will quickly despawn just as non-flying pets do.(##RESPBREAK##)2056##DELIM##adashiel##DELIM##</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mairin</b></h3>This is another pet that's good to go hunting for after a server restart. Starting with B'Naar I did a single circuit around each manaforge and with no obvious competition I found a total of 40 spawns (forges clockwise: 11,11,3,8,7) which took about 15-20 minutes. I did the same after yesterday's restart with the exact same number of spawns but it could be a coincidence so take this &quot;pattern&quot; with a grain of salt until people get a better data sample.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Florixia</b></h3>just found three of these, 2 poor and 1 uncommon just north of Manaforge Ultriss, all on the path that the voidwalkers pat along. 1:50pm server time</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Galaxas</b></h3>For those who came here to see what level they are so you wouldn't have to fly all the way there: <br /><br />Level 20.<br /><br />Reply to this if you find a 19 or 21 anywhere, I didn't see any.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kyokushinkai</b></h3>Found some of these little guys after a server reset, around the manaforges in Netherstrom. There was about 4 per manaforge, except Manaforge Coruu which had 13 up at the time. And they were suprisingly far away from the manaforge itself, occupying almost half the island.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1049255</b></h3>I found two of these at Manaforge Ultris just a minute ago, both uncommon. 5:20 am Servertime.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1039054</b></h3>It's worth noting that if you see them on your minimap through Track Pets, but can't find it, that these critters can &quot;fly&quot; into the ground. They don't change elevation with the terrain when they move, so instead of going up hill they can fly into the hill. Jut wait a moment and they should come back out to an area where they can be battled. This has happened to me about 4 times when trying to find one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ibroadfo</b></h3>Has a very diverse moveset.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>smvs232</b></h3>I always seem to find some at Manaforge Coruu. Other places it is hit and miss. Manaforge Coruu has never let me down</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>765310</b></h3>anyone caught this one in rare quality? i have spent hours in netherstorm attacked plenty of this pet but not found rare yet</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Troelsy</b></h3>These guys truly are jacks of all trades. The ability set they have can cover almost any class. lol<br />Can be used against; flying, critters, mechanicals, humanoids and aquatics. They also have Tail Sweep strong against magic, but shouldn't really set your poor flying pet up against a magic one. lol<br /><br />Probably won't be too bad against beasts either seen as he takes reduced damage against those.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1069803</b></h3>Frustrating Pet for collectors.<br /><br />I found a technique that seemed to work for me and a possible theory specific to Manaforge B'naar. May work other forges but didnt try it or may not be correlated at all. After hours of searching and not finding rays... this produced results for me.<br /><br />Went around killing everything around B'naar and circling it for spawns to no avail<br /><br />Had 4 ray spawns (2 Poor, 1 uncommon, 1 common), after doing the following.<br /><br />1) kill the phase hunters and rays on the outskirts and roach spawns.<br />2) circle for ray spawns. (kill other mobs as you go will give you something to do and make you a bit of gold)<br /><br />My theory is that the spawns are tied to the mob ray spawns on the outskirts and killing <br />the phase hunters and ray mobs will produce additional ray spawns and additional pet ray spawns along with them.<br /><br />This is just theory based on my results. Hopefully it will help some of you save some time farming.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Znaleziatko</b></h3>I didn't have any problem with finding those to battle with - there was couple of rays hanging around <b>every Manaforge</b>. I killed probably 20 (and catched a rare cat and mouse in the proccess) before finding a <b>rare</b> one - near Manaforge Ultris.<br />Good luck :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>776458</b></h3>I've been farming this thing for weeks. I must have such horrible luck, judging by other people's posts. I've tried flying around right after server resets: nothing. <br />I first got to Netherstorm just to collect any random pets and being the first comment I read about the Fledgling Nether Ray said that &quot;they're all over Netherstorm&quot; I didn't realize just how rare they are. The first one I didn't have much trouble finding, I kind of stumbled on it, and I wanted to catch it but accidentally killed it.<br />Weeks later and I did not see another single one, anywhere. Period. <br />Until today.<br />I was flying down to Manaforge Coruu from the North and I saw a green paw. Thinking &quot;f'in Nether Roaches!&quot; I sauntered down to check it out and there was nothing there! I stood there confused for a moment and low and behold a little Ray swam out from the ground right in front of me. (Yes, I know I could have just moused over the mini-map I just got tired mousing over Nether Roaches). <br />I battled it, it was common, I caught it. Then I saw another green paw a bit further along to the south. Another Ray. This one was uncommon. Accidentally killed it. Almost burst out crying, hehe.<br />Saw another one just a bit more south, at (47,84) battled it and it was a rare! <br />There was no one else around and through the entire time I've been looking for this guy I haven't seen many other people around. So I have to disagree with them being &quot;all over&quot;. Yes, they do have varied spawn points in different areas scattered around Netherstorm but they are FAR from being &quot;all over&quot;.<br />This was around 3pm and I was not killing anything to create spawns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>xxfotogrrlxx</b></h3>This may or may not be worth noting, however..after weeks of farming, and not seeing any nether battle pet marks on my map, I was flying low today and happened to notice a yellow fledgling nether ray...(no mark on the map), however, it WAS able to be targeted and battled.<br /><br />It may be a bug, but if you're struggling...fly low and look for the yellow pets, not the map marks. I flew around and tried to re-test this theory, but had no luck. Might have been a fluke, but may be a bug that some people are having?<br /><br />Just throwing it out there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dlareme</b></h3>So i notice when I am on a flight path from blades edge to area 52 there are about 6 nether rays hanging around b'naar but when im not on a flight path and i just go over there they arent there. Wtf bro?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>totorohugger</b></h3>I was flying around for about half an hour looking for this little guy when i decided to head to Manafoge Coruu based on a tip from another comment. Found him there! :) He had two cats with him aswell which i thought was odd. &quot;nether&quot; the less i got him! (see what i did there :P )</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>500959</b></h3>First night I looked for these little buggers couldn't hardly find one to save my soul.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>245300</b></h3>Since 5.2, these seem to be all over the Manaforges in varying rarities.<br /><br />Some patience is needed with certain rays, as they disappear under the surface of the ground and you have to wait for them to appear again so you can interact.</div>
