Still not a Horde-friendly location in the least, but at least a second place to be able to pick up your gobbler.\n\nIf you are Horde, and wanting to pick up one of these turkeys for your Battle Pet, your best bet is to take the path that runs near Utgarde Keep and leads down into Valgarde. There is a turkey that runs along the northern part of that pathway, and though there is a patting group of guards you may need to dodge, they will not walk the whole way along the path; you can wait at the top for them to pass and get within capture range. If it's not a 'catchable' turkey, you may need to kill and respawn it a few times, but it is a safe way to reach the bird without getting killed if you're doing it at a lower level.\n\nThe second option, Westgard Keep, has no turkeys that are within range of a low-level Horde thanks to patrolling Level 90 guards. \n\nAlternatively, and possibly the easiest way to do it, is to create a level 1 Alliance and get a friend (or paid-for ally) to use their Warlock and teleport you within these locations, or make the trip to Stormwind, boat, and do a lot of dying to get to The Fjords. Your pets will still be accessible, even if you are in a completely different faction and at a low level.\n\nIf you don't feel like being daring against these things, farm the other mobs around the Fjords. Turkeys can show up as a 'backup' creature, making it a lot easier for Horde to pick one up.

<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>apokryfos</b></h3>A few of these can be found in Valgarde, Howling Fjord</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>These can also be found in Westguard Keep. Still not a Horde-friendly location in the least, but at least a second place to be able to pick up your gobbler.<br /><br />If you are Horde, and wanting to pick up one of these turkeys for your Battle Pet, your best bet is to take the path that runs near Utgarde Keep and leads down into Valgarde. There is a turkey that runs along the northern part of that pathway, and though there is a patting group of guards you may need to dodge, they will not walk the whole way along the path; you can wait at the top for them to pass and get within capture range. If it's not a 'catchable' turkey, you may need to kill and respawn it a few times, but it is a safe way to reach the bird without getting killed if you're doing it at a lower level.<br /><br />The second option, Westgard Keep, has no turkeys that are within range of a low-level Horde thanks to patrolling Level 90 guards. <br /><br />Alternatively, and possibly the easiest way to do it, is to create a level 1 Alliance and get a friend (or paid-for ally) to use their Warlock and teleport you within these locations, or make the trip to Stormwind, boat, and do a lot of dying to get to The Fjords. Your pets will still be accessible, even if you are in a completely different faction and at a low level.<br /><br />If you don't feel like being daring against these things, farm the other mobs around the Fjords. Turkeys can show up as a 'backup' creature, making it a lot easier for Horde to pick one up. It's just a matter of patience, rather than life-risk.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>742619</b></h3>I found when I landed in Westgard there were only the critter Turkeys, by killing the turkeys I was able to get the Battle Pet Turkeys to spawn.<br /><br />Edit: I also encountered many Turkeys while battling.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1045929</b></h3>Registered just to say that I found a turkey in a pet battle with Fjord Worg Pup while trying to catch a rare one of those. So Hordies take heart! You don't have to try to fly into Alli towns to try to get one, just fight pups until one shows up.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kcartwright856</b></h3>As mentioned in other comments, the greatest concentration of these turkeys is located in Valgarde, an Alliance area, and the most efficient method for farming these is to make an Alliance alt if you are Horde.<br /><br />I hopped over to my Alliance alt after meeting the wrath of the guards several times before giving up. Only two turkeys there were able to be battled, but the place was just covered with turkey critters!<br /><br />As an experiment and release of frustration, I began to slay the plain &quot;critter&quot; turkeys. It did not take long to realize that every turkey spawn has a chance of creating either a critter or a battle pet. The chances that it will spawn a critter is higher than a battle pet, but these little guys spawn rather quickly.<br /><br />The method to the madness of the search for your rare turkey is to lay waste to the critters while you make your rounds in Valgarde. You will usually get two battle pets out of all of the spawns during each killing spree, but your mileage may vary as this is up to the RNG to decide.<br /><br />Good luck and happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>pmakaro</b></h3>Higher horde characters can also use stealth mechanics to get to some of these sitting in alliance bases. Rogues, druids, and hunters can use stealth, prowl, and camo to get around.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Loras</b></h3>Turkeys will also show up as secondary pets while battling <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62669">Fjord Worg Pups</a>. This is an easy alternative for Horde characters without alliance alts.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1071299</b></h3>Found 2 at Valgarde quite easy to get as alliance .</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Alfa</b></h3>I entered a pet battle duel and my opponent had three of these guys, all 25 rare quality. All he kept doing was using <a href="/pet-ability=580/food-coma">Food Coma</a> and swapping out for his other turkey and repeat until, A: It misses so you can get a shot in or B: you forfeit.<br /><br />I only got a few shots in on all 3, took too long so then I forfeit. I came back into the duel with a pet that has a 'This ability will always go first.' Prefer a critter, so the sleeps aren't two rounds.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>stickshift</b></h3>While you might find it amusing that Blizz thinks turkeys can fly it doesn't hold a candle to this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf3mgmEdfwg" rel="nofollow">classic moment</a> in television history.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>tiffanyblitz</b></h3>As a lvl 90 Horde Hunter, I did a few fly-by's at Valgarde to locate Turkeys and guards.<br /><br />I was able to drop in from flight to a relatively empty area, battle and collect my Turkey (poor, but obviously upgrade-able or repeatable), remount and fly off ... all without being engaged by a guard (or anyone else).<br /><br />Happy Hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>896921</b></h3>Valgarde always seems to have 2 Turkeys spawned as primary at a time. Finding a Rare is a real challenge, though, as I've been at it 2 days now. Westgard also has Turkeys as primaries, but there are more Chickens than Turkeys. Also have a decent chance on getting a Devouring Maggot there as a secondary pet.<br /><br />Update: After 2 days, still no rare Turkey. So I switched realms and flew my 90 to Valgarde. First pet battle -- rare. If you are having trouble catching that rare pet, you might want to try another realm.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>squeakypizza</b></h3>Um, the turkeys will put your pets to sleep and kick your butt. Don't underestimate them and bring some pets with good endurance!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>raistlyn</b></h3>Horde, easiest way to do this seems to be go fight the Fjord Worg Pups on the Tuskgarr Island. I found them to be a very common secondary, and got my blue in less than an hour. Not saying you will get yours that quickly, because the pet gods hate all of us less equally some days, but you might have a luckier chance there. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MRTF</b></h3>As far I know: there are three turkey battle pets in the game which you can collect: <br /><br />Highlands Turkey from Twilight Highlands, Northern part is a nice location.<br /><br />Turkey from the Howling Fjord. At the Southern Alliance camp are some.<br /><br />And Plump Turkey from the Thanksgiving event; Pilgrim's Bounty, looted from a bag if I remember right. <br /><br />They all look equally delicious &lt;3.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Valspali</b></h3>I tried both places and succeeded, after some frustrations, in Valgarde. Tried to engage one Turkey near the docks but kept getting attacked by defenders. After swimming away far enough to get out of combat I swam back and under the docks and managed to get into the pet battle...only to accidentally score a big hit and kill it! Aaargh!<br /><br />On my way out I went to my left and ended up killing the fishing trainer on the cliff as there was a Turkey there, but I had to swim away to get out of combat with the defenders. Then I flew back in and landed on the edge of the cliff and I was able to pet battle (with Terrible Turnip this time!) and capture the Turkey.<br /><br />Not a rare but I will take what I could get, and my Northrend Safari achv is complete.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>foothillsco</b></h3>Horde here.<br /><br />I got mine inside Westguard at 32, 41.<br /><br />I stayed on one side of the wall, didnt aggro anyone and did battle when a pet got close enough on the other side of the wall.<br /><br />It was a grey...</div>
