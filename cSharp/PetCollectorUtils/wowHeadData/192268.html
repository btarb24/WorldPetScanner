<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>SomeoneSneaky</b></h3>I found mine at the tunnel at /way 60 38 <br /><br />Beneath the fallen log is a gap large enough to stand under. You'll find two small burrows there, and both can spawn a Crimsonspine. When I found mine, one was a critter, and one was a battle-able pet, but the pet actually didn't show on the minimap. I had to land and look inside to see it.<br /><br />Be careful, though -- there are hostile mobs that path under the log, right past the burrows, and you can accidentally kill the Crimsonspines with AOE attacks.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dillybar</b></h3>In the holes in The Azure Span, if you are getting the &quot;Battle Pet Area Obstructed&quot; message, just keep backing up away from the hole until you can start the battle normally.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Marzen</b></h3>To add a bit more detail, and a complete description of how to get this rare pet:<br /><br />Crimsonspine are rare spawns, so plan accordingly. It will take time, unless you're lucky.<br /><br />The pets spawn in two locations. They share spawn chances with normal critters, so you'll need to clear the normal ones to eventually get a capturable/battle version.<br /><br />There are two locations:<br /><br />Five critters spawn on the road north of Gelikyr Post at the entrance to the Tyrhold Reservoir /way #2025 50.70, 64.12.<br /><br />Two critters spawn in small holes in The Azure Span /way #2024 60.54 38.09, under a fallen tree. The holes are tiny... you'll need to use AoE or other attacks to kill critters in the holes.<br /><br />When a battle-able pet spawns in one of the holes, you may get a message that the battle area is obstructed. This is more about your position than that of the target pet: simply rotate your character to give them a bit of open space facing in front and you will be able to start the battle.<br /><br />After a full day of camping, I finally got my Crimsonspine from one of the small holes. I have no idea if they spawn more frequently there or not, but I spent hours killing dozens of critters in Thaldraszus, and only a did a few trips to Azure Span. You can fly between the two locations in about the time it takes the critters to respawn after being killed, so if you really want to optimize your chances, you should fly from one spawn area to the other, and back again.<br /><br />Good hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Exit1459</b></h3>This took me around 8 hours of farming. I sat under the log in Azure Span and killed the crimsonspines in the holes and all around. I went to bed and checked in the morning and STILL no luck, so I killed what was there and went to relist my auctions. came back, and one was there. It did take some finagling to get the battle arena clear but it is possible. but be prepared for a good long wait! watched two feasts go by while camping.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Shiney79</b></h3>Every damn time you see posts like &quot;I had war mode on/off&quot; or &quot;i think it has a higher chance to spawn in the X location&quot; or &quot;I was wearing my lucky undies!&quot;<br /><br />It has nothing to do with war mode being on, or off. No location has a higher chance to spawn this pet. Your lucky undies didn't do squat. It's all COINCIDENCE, because:<br /><br />It's all RANDOM CHANCE. It has always been random chance, even from way back in the days when people thought you needed more DoTs on Onyxia so she didn't Deep Breathe. The misinformation gets really tiresaome.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sullivankyle72</b></h3>got mine in Thaldraszus location . the trick is to kill the critters that are in the given location until a pet of crimsonspine spawns. happy hunting. just camp out the location and you should eventually get it. just takes time and some patients.</div>
