<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Esinar</b></h3>Just as an FYI to horde players, you can still get this pet on a horde char as long as you meet the requirement of having 1 million gold on you. Francois is neutral and will give you the egg if you reach and speak to him. He can be tricky to reach though due to the location being at the top of a hostile alliance hub, where elite guards will attack you for getting too close. You can however enter the estate from the south cliff face and make it up to Francois relatively unchallenged. <br /><br />It's a little difficult to explain in words so I just made a quick video for horde players trying to get it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOs0XlURSmc" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOs0XlURSmc</a></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BeanTownBetty</b></h3>Heads up - if you try and do this in a group (to swap around the million), Francois will only talk to the first person of the group. To get around this after the first member talks to him and receives the egg, swap the million to another party member then they need to leave the group talk to Francois, get the Egg, rejoin the group then repeat with another party member.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DannyTheConsumer</b></h3>Before you start spending your gold, transfer your gold to an alt to get this pet again. You can get a full team of 3 Francois :D at no cost (cannot be sold on AH).</div>
