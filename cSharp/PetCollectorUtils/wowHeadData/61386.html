<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kurasu</b></h3>Lava Beetles spawn in the various lava pools in Burning Steppes, often spawning alongside <a href="/npc=61383/lava-crab">Lava Crab</a> in the same locations. They seem to share spawns with the crabs as well, so killing crabs off may get some beetles spawning faster if you're finding them hard to locate.<br /><br />When clicked, they make 'silithid beetle' sound effects.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ElentilSDS</b></h3>I spent much time during the night (after 2am and till 5am) and the spawns were pretty rare. Most of them were Lava Crabs, as Kurasu mentioned. At 5:30, a server reset happened and they swarmed all spawning spots. They were popping all around like crazy! Dont think that the reset had such an impact on the lava crab/lava beetle balance. Anyway, blue quality was just a matter of time. So, I suggest farming those in the morning. If someone else can confirm this, please do so.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>zharshoul</b></h3>must be rare spawns like the whelps.. been looking for bout an hour clearing out crabs as well and nothing</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rhinoloupe</b></h3>They do <b>not</b> appear as random extras throughout the zone. The only way to fight them is to challenge them directly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Fatgai</b></h3>These things are really good at killing themselves due to scorched earth.<br /><br />Log out/back in to reset the fight and try again.<br /><br />If it dies on the turn you captured it, you'll still have it caught. (In my case, it had 20HP left, trap took, it died from burning, still appeared on my list)<br /><br />Edit: I don't know how out date this is, but with the changes to pet battling I'm not sure if you can still reset a fight by logging out and back in. I'm going to hazard a guess and say this is now irrelevant.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dainekar</b></h3>As a previous poster noted, these spawn in lava pools. Several lava pools are clearly visible in the map. In addition, there is a pool due south of the Ruins of Thaurissan. I circled the map 3 times before I decided to leave the zone, and then just as I was leaving I found my lava beetle there :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Deftonia</b></h3>I actually found one away from the lava pools so it may be possible they are where ever.<br />It was only a poor but I caught it anyways for fear of not being able to find anymore</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maricah</b></h3>Not too hard to find, I only found one, but it was within a short amount of time, and it was uncommon. I advise looking around lava areas, of course. Tho I don't think they spawn JUST there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>allerra30</b></h3>Flew around for over an hour trying to find one of these guys. Killed tons of crabs and wasn't having any luck. Happened to see some lava trailing up in the mountains so I went exploring. In the mountains between the lake and Morgan's Vigil (coords are around 60:70) there is a huge lava pit. Found two immediately and another spawned while I was typing up this post. All poor quality but at this point I'll take whatever I can get!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1070598</b></h3>Easily mistaken with the fire beetle, it seems this little fella does NOT appear as a secondary pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>745389</b></h3>just thought id add that these appear in burning steppes co-ords 69-34 in the lava pools hope this helps anyone out</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>PriestessAur</b></h3>If you are new to leveling up pets, it is worth staying in this area for a while and trying to snag a rare Lava Beetle. An uncommon one in the P/P breed is also good. This guy will be very helpful to have in your stable once you start encountering undead pets and tamers. It has a strong heal in Cauterize that will help it last.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>woofpuppy</b></h3>These critters will kill themselves with scorched earth so you must be careful in capture tactics. Use only ONE hit of Weakening Blow from your turnip then pass ALL other actions against him until his health drops low enough for capture otherwise he dies. I killed the only rare I've seen by taking his health too low and having him die by his own hand.</div>
