Dragonhawks are good to use in this fight to further widdle down the HP for capture as some of their attacks deal some of the lowest damage against flying types which will ensure that you do not kill the Faerie Dragon as you narrow down it's HP bar.\n\nMy ideal setup for this fight is the Nether Faerie Dragons cousin; Sprite Darter Hatchling, a Dragonhawk, and one Mechanical pet.","date":"2012-08-26T15:07:21-05:00","rating":36,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"This is accurate as they nerfed the differences between common and uncommon and uncommon and rare some weeks ago, and changed many, many things.

Uncommons can have varying HP within uncommon, but they'll have lower attack/speed for the higher end of the HP scale. That said, I typically judge based on how much HP something has. so I'm listing the highest HP level I've found for each rarity.<br /><br />The highest common I've found so far has up to 738 HP, 140 Attack, 120 Speed at level 10.<br /><br />Highest uncommon I've found has 800hp, 154 attack, 156 speed at level 10.<br /><br />The rare I eventually captured has 900hp, 186 attack, 168 speed at level 10.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ravij</b></h3>Outside of the Dire Maul area is where I found this nearly translucent blue bugger. It took me a while to find a rare quality one but when I did, these were it's stats:<br /><br />Lv 11 - 636 HP - 122 Power - 143 Speed.<br />I'm not sure when Ateva made their post on finding one; but I found mine in 5.0.4 (16016) build. I think since Ateva's post the reduced the amount of HP of some pets, though I am not certain.<br /><br /><b>As for the fight itself;</b> You'll want to have a pet that can overwrite the weather effect caused by the darters Moonfire ability as the extra magic damage can hurt you and you'll find the darter especially likes to use Life Exchange which restores it's health by a lot with Moonlight in effect. The main pets you'll want to use for this fight are either Mechanical or Dragonkin, as this Darter's attacks are very weak to these types. <br /><br />Most Mechanical pets don't have any skills that would seriously cause harm to the Nether Faerie Dragon and their boosted defense against magic based abilities make them ideal for taking hits while you try to capture the dragon as well as dealing low amounts of damage to further widdle away it's HP for a more successful capture.<br /><br />A lot of Dragonkin can be used in the fight against a Nether Faerie Dragon. Dragonhawks are good to use in this fight to further widdle down the HP for capture as some of their attacks deal some of the lowest damage against flying types which will ensure that you do not kill the Faerie Dragon as you narrow down it's HP bar.<br /><br />My ideal setup for this fight is the Nether Faerie Dragons cousin; Sprite Darter Hatchling, a Dragonhawk, and one Mechanical pet.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>720025</b></h3>Took me FOREVER to find a rare version of one of these lol. I found that my Lost of Lordaeron was awesome against these things as far as slowly lowering hp yet having great survivability. I used his Absorb attack which heals for 100% of damage done. It's pretty weak, but with the Nether Faerie Dragon's Moonlight effect up, the healing was so good that he stayed close to 100% health the entire time. This made capturing a breeze. Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mcdisney2001</b></h3>When looking for a rare, keep in mind that the highest health isn't always the rarest. I caught several Uncommons (green) with 545 health pre-capture, but the Rare (blue) one I finally caught only had 530 health pre-capture. Both were level 11.<br /><br />Rare, post-capture:<br />Health: 636<br />Power: 150<br />Speed: 114<br /><br />They're all over the place inside the walled-in portion of Dire Maul (NOT insie the instance, just the regular questing area called Dire Maul). Level 35-38 ogres practically stand on top of them, so be able to kill those if you go in there.<br /><br />Edit: Why on earth would comments like this get voted down? lol</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>320719</b></h3>As of today (Patch 5.1) these are now Dragonkin type and not Flying.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>761423</b></h3>I can kind of see why these were made dragonkin instead of flying, but honestly they were much better as flying. The 50% increase on speed allowed you to use Evanescence to avoid two attacks while setting up Moonfire to use Arcane Blast spam, and you wouldn't even go below 50% and lose the speed buff.<br /><br />But now he's super slow because of no speed buff and I regret that he is one of my few max level pets. Not finding his alternate to Evanescence to be very useful, either. I may be retiring him due to this change. I'm much more fond of faster pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>FalconPawnch</b></h3>Hard to say if the change to Dragonkin reduced its ability to perform. Before the 5.1 it was a flying type which meant it gained a 50% increase to speed meaning Evanescence would dodge twice since the move went first. However, now that it's a Dragonkin it can pump out more damage than before and it's no longer weak to magic type abilities which was it's only real weakness.<br /><br />It's a trade off I suppose, only more time and battles will tell me if this was a nerf or a buff</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>376514</b></h3>Here's a crazy way of farming dragons: <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=16085#comments">Peddlefeet</a>!<br /><br />I know, he's ridiculously strong against them. Get one just because people like fielding dragons, and then watch them cry when he rips them to shreds. But for farming that rare dragonkin, he's actually amazingly useful.<br /><br />His <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=772">Lovestruck</a> + <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=773">Shot Through The Heart</a> combo will 1-shot any poor and common dragonkin before they even have a chance to react, because Peddle's got very high speed. This way, you never have to worry about healing or returning to town. His combo will occasionally 1-shot an uncommon dragonkin of equal level, but not often. The real risk is out-leveling the dragonkin before you find the rare one and then you can just pew pew with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=771">Bowshot</a> if you have to, because it's still strong vs dragonkin.<br /><br />I have yet to see him come close to 1-shotting a rare dragonkin, even a couple levels above. The upshot of all this is that you can just use the same tactic to fight each time and weed out the worthless dragons before getting your rare. Or uncommon, if you don't care too much.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1070680</b></h3>I must be getting really lucky with all these critters. I got a rare on my first one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>pmakaro</b></h3>With the reclassification as dragons they (and thier twins the <a href="/npc=9662/sprite-darter-hatchling">Sprite Darter Hatchling</a>) are excellent against flying pets. They take 33% less damage from flying and have two solid magic attacks <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=595">Moonfire</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=421">Arcane Blast</a> which do extra damage to flying pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thecanman</b></h3>Are you a serious pet battler? Do you have this pet or the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=11474/sprite-darter-egg">Sprite Darter Hatchling</a>? If not, you're doing it wrong<br /><br />Why? Because they are dragonkin pets with hard-hitting arcane abilities. Why is that significant? Because flying pets deal less damage to dragonkin pets and take more damage from arcane abilities. This is to a flying pet what a frost mage is to a warrior. As an added bonus, it's <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=595">Moonfire</a> ability causes the weather to change to moonlight, which not only increases it's already high damage by another 10%, but also allows it to compliment pets with healing abilites, by boosting their effectiveness by 25%. If your opponent brings out a flying pet, you can whip this out and watch them run away with their tail between their legs! <br /><br />Yeah, a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=7547">Azure Whelpling</a> is a dragonkin pet with hard hitting arcane abilities. But it's abilities can't be used every round, and one of them even stops you from using your pet for 2 rounds. With this you can pound your opponents over and over again for as long as necessary. Also, it's 2nd ability of either <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=440">Evanesence</a>/<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=277">Life Exchange</a> gives it extra survivability, something that the Azure Whelpling sorely lacks. If they're used properly, this can solo 3 flying pets or 2 non-flying-non-humanoid ones, and Life Exchange is godsend against the elite pets you'll fight for <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/quest=32603#comments">Beats of Fable</a>, because it both heals you and deals damage which is <b><u>not</u></b> mitigated by their passive ability. As for the weather event the whelping brings to the table...have fun with that if you use pets with stuns or roots. And like the Sprite Darter Hatchling, you'd have to deal with it's low, low drop rate, compared to the much shorter time it takes to find a rare one of these.<br /><br />The best breeds for this pet are H/P, P/P or P/B, in that order. Don't bother with S/S or S/B, because as you'll be up against flyers most of the time with this, their racial passive will make them faster automatically for at least the first half of the fight. H/P will provide a tad extra health, which improves survivability, and allows you to get more out of Life Exchange.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Moirane</b></h3>A little information you might find useful.<br /><br />As you may be aware, pets have different breeds which affect their stats. Namely HP, Power &amp; Speed. If you use an add-on such as <a href="http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/battle_pet_breedid" rel="nofollow">Battle Pet BreedID</a> it will show you the current breed, displaying maximum level stats.<br /><br />Here are the different breeds showing stats for a <a href="/npc=62395/nether-faerie-dragon">Nether Faerie Dragon</a> of rare quality:<br /><br /><div class="quote-box"><u>Breed = HP/Power/Speed</u><br /><ul><li>P/P = 1319 / 341 / 260</li><li>S/S = 1319 / 276 / 325</li><li>H/P = 1465 / 305 / 260</li><li>P/B = 1384 / 305 / 273</li><li>S/B = 1384 / 289 / 289</li></ul><br /></div></div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ajpacho</b></h3>Life Exchange is a pretty insane move against all the new 5.2 pet dailies. I highly recommend it. Pass first turn, Life Exchange second, and the enemy pet is already at 1/2 health.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Reven</b></h3>Unlike the Sprite Darter pet, the Nether Faerie Dragon does not fly together with you when you mount up. Let's hope it gets changed later on.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>dance4life</b></h3>There's quite some uniqueness to this pet. It's classified as dragon and yet has 0 dragon abilities. It's main focus is magic damage. It also has 2 weaker flying abilities. Cool looking skin and very strong attack power if you manage to catch a rare quality version. <br /><br />Also, this pet is amazing if you're out fighting all the legendary pets for the quest/daily <a href="/quest=32603/beasts-of-fable">Beasts of Fable</a>. Why? 2 reasons:<br /><br />1) Edited for 5.3: The main reason...<a href="/pet-ability=277/life-exchange">Life Exchange</a>. Considering that every legendary pet you have to battle for this quest has 2,000+ hp, the ability is very strong. Even though now in 5.3 the health pools are reduced, its still strong enough to do mid-high 100's of damage, and it <u>IGNORES</u> the 50% damage reduction buff.<br />NOTE: This ability also &quot;CANNOT&quot; miss! It still hits whether a pet is in the air, underground, underwater from Dive, or Cocooned(moth pets), etc.<br /><br />2) The other reason is because it's classified as a dragon type pet. If I can recall, there's no legendary with a humanoid ability so you can't be destroyed off the bat.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>mewmewface</b></h3>Caught one rare after spending like 1-2 hrs at The Maul, essentially I was collecting them all, like if i'd get a poor or uncommon or common i'd usually trap it and compare the stats, then make sure I delete one off out of three. Im not sure if that will help get a rare faster but its one of my theories. <br /><br />I was leveling my lowbie pets here so as not to get bored, but keep a terrible turnip with you just in case.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Vandrir</b></h3>I went 6 and 0 before finding a rare. Out of those 6 two were uncommon. Pretty interesting fight. Between her evanescence and moonfire she was able to take me down to almost three quarters HP on my mechanical and half HP on my humanoid.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gargoyle</b></h3>There is another strategy using this wonderful pet I haven't seen mentioned. S/S breed using <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=440/evanescence">Evanesence</a> is great. Because it lasts for one round and wears off at the end of the round, when you are faster than the enemy, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=440/evanescence">Evanesence</a> gives you the ability to dodge two rounds of their attacks, making it very powerful against charge up, dive, lift off, etc abilities, but also you can just use it preemptively to avoid a couple of attacks,<b> giving this breed more effective health than an H/H when you are faster than your opponent</b>. Sacrificing one round of damaging your opponent to avoid two of their attacks is what makes the S/S breed powerful. I can often kill two legendary PVE trainer pets of any type with just this pet.<br /><br />Sure against flyers, which you will probably use it against, it goes last anyway at first negating its speed advantage, but after a one or two rounds that flyer will be at half health and lose their racial bonus, so you are still very powerful against flyers with this breed, especially ones that use lift off. Against non-flyers you have the ability to dodge anything for two rounds if you are faster, making it a very flexible battle pet.<br /><br />I level lower level pets on the Timeless Isle all the time using an S/S Nether Faerie Dragon and an S/S <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=67443">Crow</a> to quickly destroy the moths, aquatics, critters, and beasts that spawn there, starting with the lower level pet then swapping in this guy and then the crow as needed. The moths typically won't kill a very low level pet on the first round, and you will level rapidly due to their high level.<br /><br />It seems the S/S breed of this pet is just fast enough to go before most of the enemy pets out there, so unfortunately because the nicer looking IMO <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=9662">Sprite Darter Hatchling</a> isn't as fast, even with an S/S breed, and doesn't work as well using this strategy.</div>
