The only place to find spawns is in Ghostlands, and they are extremely spread out there. It doesn't help that as rare as they are, they are not a guaranteed 'capturable' pet, thus potentially leaving several spawns that need to be killed to have the chance of repopulating as a 'tameable' critter. <br /><br />As a final slap in the face, these creatures share spawns. If you find spiders and rats in the area where there are larva shown, you may want to kill them, as when they respawn, it may be as a larva. All in all, that makes these creatures quite a difficult catch!<br /><br />Potentially the easiest way to find one of these is to target level 5 pets in the area, as a larva has a chance of showing up as a 'backup' critter in a pet battle.<br /><br />EDITED: Removed Naxx from the mention, as battle pets apparently do not spawn inside instances. At least not in this case.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>502763</b></h3>Found one at 76.2, 15.4 also.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Fluffums</b></h3>Just went into Naxxramas to see if these guys spawned there as the pet pane indicates. After clearing the room with the larva critters three or four times and waiting for respawns (the critters respawn after a few minutes), I'm not sure the battle pet Larvae actually spawn there.<br />You'd be better off searching the Ghostlands.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Geekgirl101</b></h3>Battle pet form only appears in Ghostlands, not in Naxxramas. On their own they're extremely rare to find. You have better chances of finding a larva when fighting random level 5 pets, these spawn an additional mob. Toads and spirit crabs are good targets, just make sure they're at least level 5 because level 4 or lower pets only spawn 1 mob. The chances of a larva are still small though, and you may have to clear away lower level pets to spawn higher level pets.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Cenna</b></h3>The best way to catch a Larva.<br /><br />1. Go to the beach (west of the map). <br />2. Attack Spirit Crabs. Make sure they are lvl 5, the other lvl 3 and 4 you can kill by weapons.<br />3. Start the fight with lvl 5 spirit crabs. <br />4. Check the two pets if they are Larva. <b><u>(! Watch out Maggot has the same image as a Larva. So chechk by name !) </u></b><br />5. Check also if one of the two is a rare.<br />6. Catch the larva.<br /><br />It taked me 25 / 30 min. <br /><br />Good luck.</div>

I did manage to find one later, info:<br />FOUND in Suncrown Village, Ghostlands (63,13) behind one of the towers. <br />Larva was the Primary target (1st position) and was lvl 5.<br />11:40pm server time<br />*uncommon<br /><br />Good Luck to you!<br /><br />**edit While waiting in that spot and submitting info, a larva did indeed respawn here but was NOT a battle pet.</div>

It makes it a lot faster to see if the target is level 5+ or not; if not, you can kill it without having to ever physically click it.<br /><br />2) Use a <a href="/spell=118089/azure-water-strider">Azure Water Strider</a> if you have it. You'll have to be running over water a lot, and it's easy to forget about this mount since most people fly everywhere. Obviously that's currently not an option in this zone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>rsanders69</b></h3>Found larva level 3 in Ghostlands as the primary battle pet. Coordinates 35 21. It was poor quality for better than running around for hours hoping it pops up with the Spirit Crabs.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1109267</b></h3>Thanks, elvisdumbledore, for the waypoints. That worked well for me! I had my rare larva before completing the first circuit of the Ghostlands. One thing: Many of Ghostland's creatures share those same spawning points. It might be better to label the waypoints &quot;Spawning Points&quot; so a user isn't expecting a larva at every one. <br /><br />I had no luck with the method of engaging the level 5 pets on the beach. Just my 2 cents worth.<br /><br />Scherzo<br />aka Anthveleron the Arrogant</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kaliopae</b></h3>I just keep looking for Larva in all the wrong places...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>477416</b></h3>i followed all the advice given below, and after hours of running around killing everything under level 5 to hope they would respawn lvl 5+ and perhaps have larva attatched to it, i ended up at the west beach where spirit crabs were and killed a few under lvl 5, then i came across my first level 5, clicked and and LOW AND BEHOLD MY LUCKY DAY! RARE LARVA! finally! i would suggest doing this! u may have to run up the beach a few times killing any under lvl 5 and battle the rest, but the chances are definately better and higher with spirit crabs in my opinion, and thats how i got my first larva and bonus it was rare!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BroncoAvsFan</b></h3>In Ghostlands, the spawn points randomly create 1 of 3 critters, <a href="/npc=16068/larva">Larva</a>, <a href="/npc=4075/rat">Rat</a>, or <a href="/npc=14881/spider">Spider</a>. If the critter you are looking for isn't the one there, kill it and maybe the respawn will be the one you want.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Spankypants</b></h3>The tip of farming the above level 5 spirit crabs for this larva is fab, thanks :) I started at the bottom of the shore and worked my way up, picking up a few rares I didn't already have along the way, before finally getting this lil fella as a secondary to the crab near the end of the shore.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Wubbulous</b></h3>Thanks Cenna. Worked really good. Took awhile, but got it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>alessandrouw</b></h3>I'm not sure if they changed something, but I just found a Larva wandering in the wilds. while I was going to the beach to farm the crabs. Anyway, here's the coords:<br /><br />/way 24,12 20,65<br /><br />I highly suggest having a <a href="/npc=63365/terrible-turnip">Terrible Turnip</a> due to the <a href="/pet-ability=826/weakening-blow">Weakening Blow</a>. It'll save you the trouble to accidentally critical hit the pet and killing it forever.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BeastyBoss</b></h3>Just caught one by Fighting a Small Frog, it was the secondary pet (Uncommon)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kaltac</b></h3>After spending countless hours farming for this pet off the Spirit crabs I have noticed a pattern.<br /><br />This is for Spirit crabs level 5 and up that bring in another pet.<br /><br />Rare Crabs will bring in only Larva<br />Uncommon Crabs will bring in only a maggot<br />Common will bring in either a Toad or Small frog<br />Poor will bring in either a Snake, rat, small frog or spider.<br /><br />So what I have found was that you could go to one area and farm all the pets from this zone in an easy loop instead of running all over the map trying to find them.<br /><br />If my observations are incorrect please let me know. :D<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone trying to farm up all this pets for their achievement.<br /><br />Edited: For spelling.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bomigabster</b></h3>I needed a spirit crab as well as a Larva so headed to the coast first as those are easier to find and Larva tend to be secondaries. As someone mentioned below, fight level fives and above because you won't get a secondary from lower levels . I wanted to explore the map as well so I rode all over the joint (can't fly in this zone) and saw maybe three battle pets all up, fought them to try out a few of my lowbies and force a respawn. Headed to Deathholme and found over 10 pets to battle where I found my larva as a secondary to a <a href="/npc=61753/maggot">Maggot</a>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>HushGlowie</b></h3>My experience with this little bugger consisted of killing the single Larva that spawned in the zone repeatedly until one spawned as a battle pet, switching my first battle pet to one of similar level, and battling until I caught it. Wasn't too hard, just a little time consuming. :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Grammie</b></h3>Level 6 toad @ /Way 60.90 7.0 - - - - Suncrown Village water area that borders Eversong Woods...spent whole day chasing crabs - it's a lie - not one in a thousand had larva....killed all pets in actual land...took at least two hours...level 6 pet should not be this hard</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gladly</b></h3>I was lucky enough to run past a Larva as primary in The Scar while progressing the Void Elf allied race quest. Having hunted this pet in the past, the annoyance of so casually finding one was not lost on me....</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MaxDoesWowhead</b></h3>Maybe I was just extremely lucky, but I got this as a secondary enemy in pet battles within the first 5 minutes of trying - this is what worked for me:<br /><br /><ul><li>Go straight to Deatholme in Ghostlands .<br />(36.0 - 71.8)</li></ul><br /><br /><ul><li>Battle any <a href="/npc=61753/maggot">Maggot</a> you see that is level 5 or higher.</li></ul><br /><br /><ul><li>No <a href="/npc=62022/larva">Larva</a> as second enemy? Kill it.</li></ul><br /><br /><ul><li>Run around Deathholme unitil respawns.</li></ul><br /><br /><ul><li>Go agane.</li></ul><br /><br />Again, this is what worked for me, and I got it in a very short amount of time. Do let me know if this works for you too!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bubbles1707</b></h3>So I spent about 2 hours running around fighting all the maggots in Deathholme and got no Larva. Then while waiting for them to respawn I thought I'd try my luck in the Scar and I got it as a secondary in two mins :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gonkz</b></h3>Just got my larva. After following every advice here, what worked was fighting every spirit crab over 5 I could find, until a Larva appeared as secondary. GL</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DeimosPhoboss</b></h3>So I tried a few diff things in the comments here and these are the results<br /><br />prob about 20 or so crabs <br />farmed the Deatholme area only battling level 5 maggots, did this for prob 3hrs and gave up<br /><br />next day I started in DH again with no luck<br /><br />decided to head north through the scar and the first lvl 5 maggot had a Larva with it!<br /><br />point is, if you're still trying to get this pet in 2021, start in Deatholme and farm lvl 5 maggots, maybe you will get lucky as others have, once you run out of lvl 5s, head north through the scar and farm those lvl 5s, then double back to Deatholme and rise repeat! Eventually you will get it!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kalnov04</b></h3>05.21.2021 This took me a fair amount of time. I killed up and down the beach, including the island, twice. Noticed a ton more spawns and all lvl 5/6 including more rares. Thanks for the info Cenna!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>GaitaofThrall</b></h3>Perhaps I got lucky, but I found two in a row up in the northwest corner of Ghostlands right at the border.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DavrosXV</b></h3>After spending a whole afternoon just to get a <b><i>green </i></b>one, I definitely recommend using the crab method.<br /><br />The marked spawn points for the larva have an abysmally low chance of even spawning as a capture-able pet (lucky to get 1-2 per circuit), and on top of that have low odds of spawning as a larva (let alone one of worthwhile value) instead of spider or rat.<br /><br />Running up &amp; down the coast checking L5+ crabs yields a much higher (although still not great) rate of capture-able Larvae.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Laderoth</b></h3>I tried the Maggot method in Deathholme but every maggot there was only level 3 so no secondary battler. Off to crabs I guess.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>xLunacyx</b></h3>tdlr version: easier to fight lv5+ battle pets in The Ghostlands to find Larva as a backup enemy</div>
