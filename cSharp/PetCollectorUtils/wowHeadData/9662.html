var lv_comments0 = [{"commentv2":1,"number":0,"id":14435,"nreplies":4,"sticky":0,"user":"8403","body":"This little guy is probably one of the cutest small pets you can get. He can be a pain to get, though, so here's a quick overview. You will first need to head to Feralas. Just before crossing west over the Verdantis River, head north east to a small valley. Look along the northern mountain edge to find a small natural path. It can be hard to spot, so make sure you scour the area well. Take this path and talk to the night elf to receive a quest. I believe the first quest is to kill a certain number of the tauren mobs around the area.\n\nAfter this, you will receive a second quest. This is, if I have the order of sequence correct, the quest where you have to escort her to the cage of darters and set them free. Be sure you follow them a little bit, or the tauren to the east and south will kill them, and you will fail the quest. Once enough go free, you will be sent to Darnassus. This is where most people think the quest line ends. This is not true.\n\nAfter turning in this quest at Darnassus, RETURN to where you got the first quest and talk to the night elf lady again. This time she will give you a small egg. You will need to swiftly deliver it to another night elf stationed in the shimmering flats of Thousand Needles. You have one hour to get him there, so if you already have a mount or the flight path to Tanaris, you should be okay. Otherwise, try to avoid as many battles as possible while hoofing it on foot. Once you get to him and give him the egg, the timer will go away, but now you'll need to give him two elixirs of fortitude. Be sure to have these prior to returning to the Night Elf in Feralas so you can finish this guy's quest quickly and easily.\n\nAfter giving him the elixirs of fortitude, he will then give the egg back to you, and he will ask you to deliver it to a dwarf stationed in the Hinterlands. Make sure to set your hearthstone to IF or somewhere closer before beginning this line to make this step easier. I'm not entirely sure, but I believe you get another timer before the little guy in the egg dies. Anyway, head to the hinterlands and go to the basement of the main inn (which is more of a barracks if you ask me). Talk to the dwarf guy in this building to complete the quest. He will then ask you to go kill the Silvermane Stalkers, which are stealthed level 46-48 wolves in northeastern hinterlands, for their flanks. These can be a pain to get, so make sure you have time for a 20 min to an hour's worth of farming\/grinding.\n\nOnce you have all of the flanks, return to the dwarf in the basement of the barracks to complete the quest. FINALLY, talk to him once or twice more and you will receive your Sprite Darter Egg. Make sure to show him off to all of your friends, you went through a lot of work to get him out of that egg alive! =D Enjoy this little cutie.","date":"2006-12-12T20:22:38-06:00","rating":54,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":1,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Heh, ya I have to agree, this guy is cute as hell =) Alot of people like to admire it as well.","creationdate":"2007-08-08T07:01:57-05:00","id":13016,"rating":4,"commentid":14435,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"77169","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"The quest chain, which has you care for the egg until it hatches, is a fun and memorable one for obtaining a pet companion.

<noscript><div id="user-comments"><h2 class="heading-size-2">Comments</h2><div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>8403</b></h3>This little guy is probably one of the cutest small pets you can get. He can be a pain to get, though, so here's a quick overview. You will first need to head to Feralas. Just before crossing west over the Verdantis River, head north east to a small valley. Look along the northern mountain edge to find a small natural path. It can be hard to spot, so make sure you scour the area well. Take this path and talk to the night elf to receive a quest. I believe the first quest is to kill a certain number of the tauren mobs around the area.<br /><br />After this, you will receive a second quest. This is, if I have the order of sequence correct, the quest where you have to escort her to the cage of darters and set them free. Be sure you follow them a little bit, or the tauren to the east and south will kill them, and you will fail the quest. Once enough go free, you will be sent to Darnassus. This is where most people think the quest line ends. This is not true.<br /><br />After turning in this quest at Darnassus, RETURN to where you got the first quest and talk to the night elf lady again. This time she will give you a small egg. You will need to swiftly deliver it to another night elf stationed in the shimmering flats of Thousand Needles. You have one hour to get him there, so if you already have a mount or the flight path to Tanaris, you should be okay. Otherwise, try to avoid as many battles as possible while hoofing it on foot. Once you get to him and give him the egg, the timer will go away, but now you'll need to give him two elixirs of fortitude. Be sure to have these prior to returning to the Night Elf in Feralas so you can finish this guy's quest quickly and easily.<br /><br />After giving him the elixirs of fortitude, he will then give the egg back to you, and he will ask you to deliver it to a dwarf stationed in the Hinterlands. Make sure to set your hearthstone to IF or somewhere closer before beginning this line to make this step easier. I'm not entirely sure, but I believe you get another timer before the little guy in the egg dies. Anyway, head to the hinterlands and go to the basement of the main inn (which is more of a barracks if you ask me). Talk to the dwarf guy in this building to complete the quest. He will then ask you to go kill the Silvermane Stalkers, which are stealthed level 46-48 wolves in northeastern hinterlands, for their flanks. These can be a pain to get, so make sure you have time for a 20 min to an hour's worth of farming/grinding.<br /><br />Once you have all of the flanks, return to the dwarf in the basement of the barracks to complete the quest. FINALLY, talk to him once or twice more and you will receive your Sprite Darter Egg. Make sure to show him off to all of your friends, you went through a lot of work to get him out of that egg alive! =D Enjoy this little cutie.</div>

I named her Tria.<br /><br />Recently, I've noticed that these pets have been showing up on the auction house. And they're being sold at prices that really don't match the amount of farming it takes to get them, or simply how awesome they are.<br /><br />The Sprite Darter Hatching is awesome, and it is hard to get. Even though I would never consider selling my beloved Tria, I find it sad and wrong that this pet is being sold for merely a couple thousand gold at most. And at the same time, rare-upgraded Gilnean Ravens are selling for far more; the at level 25 I've seen them go for 10k+!<br /><br />Respect the Sprite Darter, people!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>huldu</b></h3>I hate rng. Lost count of the whelps I've killed without ever seeing one. I head over to feralas and after 81 mobs(yes, sadly I keep track) the darter drops. It really doesn't matter if you get it or not, I despite drop rates below 1%. It just doesn't belong in any game.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>HaiZ</b></h3>New Thalanaar is where you should be farming it.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MRTF</b></h3>Since no one surprisingly has pointed this out; Faerie Dragons were first introduced in Warcraft III Frozen Throne in the Night Elf campaign and were mostly support units, very strong against casters. This is the models background. <br /><br />Lorewise it was most likely introduced first in the Kalimdor books.<br /><br />(Can't remember any mentioning of them from WC1-2).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>merenhuiske</b></h3>When I get bored I usually go to New Thalanaar to farm Silk Cloth and this while watching Netflix on the other monitor. It's really easy to farm when you have a spell like Corruption which doesn't mind if you are facing the mob or not. I wrote this macro to target and kill them and every 2 minutes or so I loot the mobs.<br /><br />#showtooltip<br />/target Grimtotem Marauder<br />/cast Corruption<br />/cleartarget<br /><br />Obviously change Corruption to any spell without cooldown and facing requirements.<br /><br />Happy hunting</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>AngryPrawn</b></h3>The egg dropped for me today...from the Feral Scar Yeti in the cave located around 52,59. Entrance around 54,57.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Saebrora</b></h3>So can anyone tell me if you can still get this pet?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>stickshift</b></h3>I named mine Anna Riginal to pay tribute to the players who toiled over getting their companions before it became easy and fashionable.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Abrams846</b></h3>Thought this page could use a quick update:<br /><br />New Thalanar got nerfed, so it is no longer an effective place to farm this pet. Instead, you're gonna wanna make your way to 75, 29 and farm gordunni orges.<br /><br />Happy farmin</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zodlike</b></h3>I always farm the Noxious Whelps so both pets have a chance to drop.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BarrosTV</b></h3>So after like 10 hours straight up farming this thing by killing the Gordunni Ogres and Grimtotem Marauders I bought it from the Auction House for 65k.<br /><br />These little things are really not worth the hassle. I appreciate that they make the content but farming one pet for over 10 hours is ridicolous. <br /><br />Good Luck to everyone trying to get this :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Omnil</b></h3>Haven't seen it elsewhere, so I wanted confirm that this IS obtainable for Horde in WotLK Classic right now!</div>
