First, it is mechanical, which has a great passive ability and whose only weakness is very rare in the wild (Elementals). At level 1, it learns Claw, a standard Beast attack. Then at level 2, it learns Wind-Up, a super powerful spammable Mechanical attack.\r\n\r\nThis means that by level 2, it has a powerful anti-beast attack and a good anti-critter attack. Considering that like 70% of Wild pets are either Critters or Beasts, this pet will have a type advantage against more Wild pets at level 2 than most pets would have by level 20. Add on top of that its third ability (which you will definitely want the superior Overcharge over Prowl when you can get it) and its great base stats, and this is probably going to be the new recommended pet for all new Pet Battlers.","date":"2012-11-26T01:29:24-06:00","rating":49,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":1,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":7,"id":1769091,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Demiria","body":"Found a few of them, right above the toxic airfield.","date":"2012-11-27T18:41:40-06:00","rating":13,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":8,"id":1769104,"nreplies":3,"sticky":0,"user":"Marali","body":"They seem to be located in the toxic airfield along with the underground gnome starting area.

You will lose some power, but this doesn't matter at all: You will still one-shot your enemies. At the same time the speed will give you a lot more control over the battle and decrease the chances your one ultra strong hit just gets avoided.\nYou can check your breed based on your values for all levels and qualities here at Battle Info: http:\/\/www.warcraftpets.com\/wow-pets\/mechanical\/lifelike-creations\/fluxfire-feline\/\n\n[b]Abilities:[\/b]\nSlot one: I suggest Pounce, since it is stronger if you go first, which most times you should - and only slightly weaker if you are not going first.\nSlot two: Wind up. Period. This is your one-shot ability. Right now this ability ignores self repair \/ immortality of mechanical \/ undead pets: Killed by this, they don't come back, they just die.\nSlot three: Supercharge. I don't know why they put Prowl there, since Prowl has a longer cooldown AND reduces your speed.\n\nIf you play this correctly you will nearly always kill one enemy, quite often kill (or at least heavily wound) a second pet and sometimes wipe out the entire enemy team.\n\nAlways be aware of what the enemy does and can do: An AddOn that tracks enemy abilities incl. their cooldowns! is very helpful here - PetTracker would be an example. \n\nNow for the battle itself - this is the \"standard\" way, just adapt if needed.\nRound one: Supercharge\nRound two: Wind-Up (Charge)\nRound three: Wind-Up (hit) -> ~2k hit = first enemy down\n\nFrom here on be aware on your hitpoints, check how many abilities you can get guaranteed. Consider both your self repair but as well hits that can counter that (e.g. by hitting multiple times) and abilities, that always go first. If you have enough time just repeat:\nRound four: Wind-Up (Charge)\nRound five: Supercharge\nRound six: Wind-Up (hit) -> 2nd enemy down.\n\nIf you get to round six like that, you most likely will have won the battle.\n\n[b]Natural Prey of the Fluxfire Feline:[\/b]\nEspecially screwed against a Fluxfire Feline are defensive pets, especially those that rely on healing (healing doesn't matter if you are killed with one hit) and\/or absolute damage reduction (\"Reduces up to x damage from each attack against you\" - doesn't matter if you get 1.8k hits instead of 2k). \nOverall there are very few pets that can stand their ground against this kitty.\n\n[b]Natural Enemies of the Fluxfire Feline:[\/b]\nElemental Pets can be a problem, especially if they use a smart [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=179\/conflagrate]Conflagrate[\/url]. However: Even though elementals are very strong vs. mechanical pets, a Fluxfire Feline often can still beat them or at least get a draw.\nVery strong are magical pets, especially oozes like the [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=62697]Oily Slimeling[\/url]: You need at least 3 hits on them and if they heal for more than 20% of their max HP between the first and second hit you even need four. Bottom line: Those will destroy a Fluxfire Feline.\nOther than that: Faster pets can be problematic, especially if they have some disabling ability.\n\n[b]Additional notes:[\/b]\nDon't be shy swapping your Fluxfire Feline out if something problematic happens (e.g. swap in of a magic pet by your opponent). All self buffs sustain through pet swaps. However: You might not want to swap it in but instead wait until another of your pets died: This way your enemy won't get a free - and in this case very valuable - hit. \nAs for pet combinations: You won't want to combine this pet with other pets that deal damage to the entire enemy team, like [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/spell=75906]Lil' XT[\/url]. One-Shot stays one-shot. ;) You MIGHT want to combine it with a [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=453]Sandstorm[\/url] to increase it's survival.

It is an extremely overpowered pet that can take out multiple enemies at once against certain comps.\r\n\r\nThe real trick to this pet involves the combination of Wind-Up and Supercharge.  It takes 3 turns to do all these abilities (one turn to cast Wind-Up the first time, one turn to cast Supercharge, and one turn to cast Wind-Up the second time), but at level 25 this will do approximately 2000 damage, enough to one-shot almost any pet even against the strongest trainers.  I don't know of any pet that can match this type of damage with the exception of [npc=54027 domain=www] ; however, Lil' Tarecgosa can only do this damage when combining Surge of Power after having killed an enemy pet, so it is far less versatile.\r\n\r\nOne of the exceptionally unique things about this is that you can \"bank\" the first two turns in your pocket and then use the third turn at will.  Both Supercharge and the first cast of Wind-Up are buffs of infinite duration, so you can cast these two abilities while the enemy has a weak-hitting pet out, move Fluxfire Feline to the backline, then pull it out in order to one-shot a hard-hitting pet before it can kill Fluxfire.  Even if you aren't going to move Fluxfire to the backline, you can still pre-cast Wind-Up on a weak pet as long as you finish the enemy off with Claw.

A somewhat novel way to counter this pet is with [item=73905 domain=www] .  Note that [item=87526 domain=www] is an identical pet (in terms of the abilities you will be using) and thus works as well, but comes as Uncommon by default, meaning you have to get a stone to upgrade it first.  I'll be referring to the Zeppelin in the explanation for this reason, but the two are obviously interchangeable.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you'll be equipping Thunderbolt in the tier 1 slot, not surprising, since it does extra damage to mechanical.  You'll basically be Thunderbolting them to death with a few exceptions where you'll be using Decoy.\r\n\r\nThe real trick is Decoy in the tier 2 slot however.  This ability will absorb 2 incoming attacks, which by default works well against one-hitting attacks that only occur every few turns, like the Fluxfire Feline's.  Now, there's a few ways that this can play out:\r\n\r\n1) If your Zeppelin is faster than their Fluxfire:\r\nThis is a little bit of a simpler situation.  You can wait until you see the opponent cast Supercharged and then drop the Decoy on the next turn.  This will cause their Supercharged attack to get absorbed with the decoy, wasting their 3 turns of preparation as well as putting their Supercharged on cooldown.  They'll then follow up with a tier 1 attack to break your Decoy, at which point you'll be back to a slug-fest.\r\n\r\nIf the opponent is smart, they'll realize what you intend to do with Decoy and try to attack a turn early.  At a bare minimum, this will prevent them from using a Supercharged combo, but will still hit hard.  If you anticipate your opponent trying this, you should drop your Decoy a turn early.  THIS will do one of two things.  If they Wind-Up a second time as you expect, you'll now absorb 2 turns with the attacks, and they'll still need to use their tier 1 attack once before they can start up again. Well worth the effort.  If they Supercharge instead, unless they're stupid, they'll follow up with tier 1 attacks for 2 turns; however, this will still burn their Supercharge as it will get used up in the first tier 1 attack absorbed by Decoy.\r\n\r\n2) Your Zeppelin is slower\r\nSame idea, except now you have to anticipate your opponents moves a little better.  If you think they're going to use a full-out 3-turn one-shot, then you need to drop your decoy on the turn that they're going to Supercharge so that it's up when they're ready to one-shot.  Unless your opponent is naive, they'll now use two tier 1 attacks to break the Decoy, which will preserve their Wind-Up charge but will waste Supercharged.\r\n\r\nIf your opponent is smart enough to not waste a Supercharged Wind-Up because they know you're going to Decoy, then you need to drop Decoy on the first turn.  This is obviously the least effeective case as it no longer wastes either Supercharged or a Wind-Up charge, but it will still draw 2 turns of their attacks in exchange for just 1 turn of dropping the Decoy.  That is, unless they open with Supercharged instead of Wind-Up, in which case you still waste one of their cooldowns.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn either case, you should be able to delay for enough turns to kill the Fluxfire; remember that both you and the Fluxfire rez on death.   Luckily, your tier 1 talent hits substantially harder than theirs (due to it being elemental), so you should easily beat them if you get into a tier 1 slug-fest, with their only advantage being if they combine both Wind-Up and Supercharged.","date":"2013-01-21T08:53:26-06:00","rating":24,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":66,"id":1803030,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"Giadia","body":"I logged into a Low Pop Server on Brazil and found mind in the Gnome Area where the little gnome buildings were.

If this pet is an important part of your lineup for certain trainers, be ready to replace it.  They're replacing Supercharge with an aoe ability, hence removing the 3-turn one-shot combo.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean this pet will become worthless though; it just won't be the nearly unbeatable powerhouse it is right now.  It still has a good lineup of a Beast attack (either Claw or Pounce pending your relative speed to the enemy's) and Wind-Up; since Critters and Beasts are common enemies against trainers at the moment, this is still a good combo of abilities.  \r\n\r\nAlso, it sounds like they're not removing Prowl, so you can still do ONE god-powered ability every 5 turns.  That being said, with Prowl being the big ability now, there's no longer nearly as much reason to use a high-speed Fluxfire.  If your goal is to use a 3-turn one-shot, you're going to have to be 30% slower by the time the final turn moves around, and it's nearly impossible that you're going to be the faster pet under any situation with this limitation, so you might as well go for the high-power variant.","date":"2013-02-02T18:07:09-06:00","rating":12,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":68,"id":1809588,"nreplies":1,"sticky":0,"user":"662743","body":"I had to get one of these cats to see what all the talk was about and I have to admit, he hits harder than any of my other pets so far.

This pet's attacks do so much damage, that if it does lose it's far more likely to be due to not getting that final attack in, than an attack not doing enough damage. The \"weaker\" DPS model can still get 4k+  crits, and can oneshot the vast majority of pets when Supercharged, so if you use a stone on one of these, I recommend going with the faster version to get as many hits in as possible.\n\nEdit: I've heard that this pet is to be be nerfed in 5.2 with Supercharge being removed and replaced with an AOE, but prowl will not, so you can only do a one-shotter every 5 turns instead of every 3, and are forced to reduce your speed anyway to do so, so if this is in fact the case then the power model will be the better choice; glad I have both leveled.

I have been guarding this secret forever because I wanted to make sure my close friends got their Fluxfire Feline pet first.     Then of course over time it slipped my mind to share it with the community.\r\n\r\nI believe Wild Battle Pets are like any other herbing, mining and fishing nodes.    If you mine only Saronite in a zone that shares Saronite with Cobalt ore, you will soon find the zone full of nothing but Cobalt Ore.   Likewise fishing in a zone with two shared pools you will soon fish-out the type you want, and an overabundance of the one you don't want.  Or in the case of Fluxfire felines, the zone soon becomes full of [url=\/npc=61690]Alpine Hares[\/url], and [url=\/npc=61689]Snow Cubs[\/url], and [url=\/npc=61080]Rabbits[\/url]\r\n\r\nHow this applies to Fluxfires is I believe the game server has a soft limit to how many \"battle pets\" can spawn.  Since the Dwarf starting area [url=\/zone=6176]Coldridge Valley[\/url] has no enemies that eat the battle pets, the Dwarf starting area soon becomes a forest of green paws. Thus destroying the critters in the Dwarf starting area, allows for other battle pets to spawn in the zone.  I was able to help many friends get their Fluxfire Felines this way.  \r\n\r\n[b]The EASIEST way to catch a Fluxfire Feline without making gnomes on strange servers[\/b] is to go over the mountain to the Dwarven starting area of [url=\/zone=6176]Coldridge Valley[\/url].    Here you will quickly see that there are dozens and dozens of wild battle pets.     If you go on a battle pet killing spree till you can see no more paws on your minimap.    Then fly immediately over to the area the fluxfires spawn.   There will be between 3 and 6 Fluxfire Felines or [url=npc=61691]Irradiated Roaches[\/url] spawned.\r\n\r\nJust keep doing this.   This is how I got all my friends their Fluxfire felines.    \r\n\r\nAfter a while, the battle pet distribution is more even in the zone, and so you need to go outside the dwarf starting area to \"clear them out\" but this trick still works. Once you have done this a few times, the zone battle pet concentration is pretty even, and this trick slows down.  So at this point you drop the Fluxfire Feline hunt, and come back later.   This is because the zone as a whole has more more natural enemies to critters, so these will eventually thin the zone wide battle pet concentration bringing it back to the Dwarven starting area.     So give the server about 2 hours, you can come back and do this same trick again and it will work.    Spawning between 2 and 3 Fluxfire Felines every time you go on a critter killing spree.    Eventually though, the number of [url=\/npc=61689]Snow Cubs[\/url] in the zone gets too much, since only rabbits and roaches are \"eaten\" by the various predators in the zone.   To keep this trick working, you are forced to clean the cubs out eventually.","date":"2014-01-12T12:25:13-06:00","rating":12,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Simply clearing out all of the battle pets in the gnome starter area is sufficient - fly around the edges and wipe them all out, it'll spawn in a few bugs and hopefully a cat or two.","creationdate":"2014-01-25T00:18:42-06:00","id":724095,"rating":-2,"commentid":1933924,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"Brulath","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false}],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":98,"id":1935786,"nreplies":2,"sticky":0,"user":"Neekoras","body":"[ul]\r\n[li]Find low population realm (while they still exist)\r\n\r\n[ul]\r\n[li]Create Gnome character\r\n[ul]\r\n[li]Find 2 or 3 Fluxfire Feline's right in the starting area.\r\n\r\nHappy hunting :)[\/li]\r\n[\/ul][\/li]\r\n[\/ul][\/li]\r\n[\/ul]","date":"2014-01-19T01:40:05-06:00","rating":-5,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"I suppose the craze for hunting rare fluxfires has calmed down. this may still work to some extent, but as servers are combining this will stop working","creationdate":"2014-01-20T00:09:39-06:00","id":722905,"rating":0,"commentid":1935786,"dataTree":1,"roles":0,"username":"Posh","markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false},"downvotedByUser":false,"reportedByUser":false,"votedByUser":false},{"body":"I did this on Dawnbringer US, however, all I have to say is, \"It's like having 10,000 kitties when all you need is a roach!\" This server had like 20 Fluxfire kittens in the train station and another 10 up in the airfield.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MMOSimca</b></h3>This is going to be an amazing pet for new Pet Battlers. First, it is mechanical, which has a great passive ability and whose only weakness is very rare in the wild (Elementals). At level 1, it learns Claw, a standard Beast attack. Then at level 2, it learns Wind-Up, a super powerful spammable Mechanical attack.<br /><br />This means that by level 2, it has a powerful anti-beast attack and a good anti-critter attack. Considering that like 70% of Wild pets are either Critters or Beasts, this pet will have a type advantage against more Wild pets at level 2 than most pets would have by level 20. Add on top of that its third ability (which you will definitely want the superior Overcharge over Prowl when you can get it) and its great base stats, and this is probably going to be the new recommended pet for all new Pet Battlers.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>gnorkthedark</b></h3>This comment is now obsolete with the nerf. The fluxfire feline is still a powerful pet, but not nearly as crushing as it was before.<br /><br /><s>Having this pet at level 25, with the stats 1237 health, 322 damage / 289 speed - i have to admit, it's so powerful it's almost ridiculous.<br /><br />Supercharge increases the damage done by 150%, wind-up increases by an additional 10% in addition to doing 769 damage BEFORE percentage modifiers. On most targets, this pet is can do 2000 (no, you did not read wrong) damage on targets which arent beast or elemental, and that in 3 moves. (289 speed is faster than most targets) <br />The ability hits for around 1350 on a elemental target, and i have on several occations killed Lil' Ragnaros, which is <i>the</i> strongest pet against mechanical pets.<br /><br />I dare to say this is the most powerful battle pet in-game, and its only real weakness is magic pets which can only take 40% of their health in one damaging move. And even then, killing magic pets with punce or claw is very possible indeed.</s></div>

Captured it right away and put it in my Roach Capture team. <br /><br />A few minutes later a roach popped up, and I thought this is a good chance to test out my new level 2 mechanical kitty! ...and it two-shot him, and I didn't get to capture the roach! But an uncommon roach popped up in a few more minutes that I was able to capture. All is well! :)<br /><br />Oh, this was inside the halls of Gnomer, outside the instance entrances.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kokiron</b></h3>I have a rare lvl 25 one of these (Breed ID 8, 18 for those in that deep, I want to get a 5, 15 and try it too) and in 3 rounds it can crush just about anything you put in front of it. Supercharge + Wind-Up x2 and they drop like flies. Only things that haven't gone from full to dead with it for me so far are a few pets that are resistant to mechanical; namely the spirit tamer's spirit pets. Picking one of these up is worth it imo if you can get your hands on one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>sickbox</b></h3>This one is definitely a bit more up to chance than some. Ran around killing roaches for who knows how long before farming some low pop servers. I think that taking out some of the battle pets just outside the Airfield seemed to get things spawning in the middle better. Eventually after finishing up a run through a random server I saw one on my way back up into Gnomeregan. Got there just in time, someone with a Netherwing swooped in on it too. Happened to be the Blue I was looking for.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ayrianna</b></h3>This pet is a little terrifying. I took an uncommon breed out to Kun Lai to chew on the beasts out there, and even at level 7, she was 1-shotting the level 25 lizards with the prowl/windup combo.<br /><br />I think she has officially replaced my Blue Clockwork Rocketbot as my go-to mechanical... Now, to finish leveling her!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Felyae</b></h3>From a PvP point of view this is one of the (if not THE) strongest burst pets and is very hard to counter. 2000 hits without being strong or crits are pretty much standard, allowing you to one-shot nearly all non-magic/elemental pets - and even some elemental pets.<br /><br />If you are farming this: Alway go for the high speed breed (5,15) which will have 325 speed as rare on lvl 25. You will lose some power, but this doesn't matter at all: You will still one-shot your enemies. At the same time the speed will give you a lot more control over the battle and decrease the chances your one ultra strong hit just gets avoided.<br />You can check your breed based on your values for all levels and qualities here at Battle Info: <a href="http://www.warcraftpets.com/wow-pets/mechanical/lifelike-creations/fluxfire-feline/">http://www.warcraftpets.com/wow-pets/mechanical/lifelike-creations/fluxfire-feline/</a><br /><br /><b>Abilities:</b><br />Slot one: I suggest Pounce, since it is stronger if you go first, which most times you should - and only slightly weaker if you are not going first.<br />Slot two: Wind up. Period. This is your one-shot ability. Right now this ability ignores self repair / immortality of mechanical / undead pets: Killed by this, they don't come back, they just die.<br />Slot three: Supercharge. I don't know why they put Prowl there, since Prowl has a longer cooldown AND reduces your speed.<br /><br />If you play this correctly you will nearly always kill one enemy, quite often kill (or at least heavily wound) a second pet and sometimes wipe out the entire enemy team.<br /><br />Always be aware of what the enemy does and can do: An AddOn that tracks enemy abilities incl. their cooldowns! is very helpful here - PetTracker would be an example. <br /><br />Now for the battle itself - this is the &quot;standard&quot; way, just adapt if needed.<br />Round one: Supercharge<br />Round two: Wind-Up (Charge)<br />Round three: Wind-Up (hit) -&gt; ~2k hit = first enemy down<br /><br />From here on be aware on your hitpoints, check how many abilities you can get guaranteed. Consider both your self repair but as well hits that can counter that (e.g. by hitting multiple times) and abilities, that always go first. If you have enough time just repeat:<br />Round four: Wind-Up (Charge)<br />Round five: Supercharge<br />Round six: Wind-Up (hit) -&gt; 2nd enemy down.<br /><br />If you get to round six like that, you most likely will have won the battle.<br /><br /><b>Natural Prey of the Fluxfire Feline:</b><br />Especially screwed against a Fluxfire Feline are defensive pets, especially those that rely on healing (healing doesn't matter if you are killed with one hit) and/or absolute damage reduction (&quot;Reduces up to x damage from each attack against you&quot; - doesn't matter if you get 1.8k hits instead of 2k). <br />Overall there are very few pets that can stand their ground against this kitty.<br /><br /><b>Natural Enemies of the Fluxfire Feline:</b><br />Elemental Pets can be a problem, especially if they use a smart <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=179/conflagrate">Conflagrate</a>. However: Even though elementals are very strong vs. mechanical pets, a Fluxfire Feline often can still beat them or at least get a draw.<br />Very strong are magical pets, especially oozes like the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62697">Oily Slimeling</a>: You need at least 3 hits on them and if they heal for more than 20% of their max HP between the first and second hit you even need four. Bottom line: Those will destroy a Fluxfire Feline.<br />Other than that: Faster pets can be problematic, especially if they have some disabling ability.<br /><br /><b>Additional notes:</b><br />Don't be shy swapping your Fluxfire Feline out if something problematic happens (e.g. swap in of a magic pet by your opponent). All self buffs sustain through pet swaps. However: You might not want to swap it in but instead wait until another of your pets died: This way your enemy won't get a free - and in this case very valuable - hit. <br />As for pet combinations: You won't want to combine this pet with other pets that deal damage to the entire enemy team, like <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=75906">Lil' XT</a>. One-Shot stays one-shot. ;) You MIGHT want to combine it with a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=453">Sandstorm</a> to increase it's survival. However: The increased miss chance of the Sandstorm can ruin your day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>spiralofhope</b></h3>People argue that this pet is awesome because of the burst damage it can do.<br /><br /><b>The damage it puts out isn't special at all. Not at all.</b><br /><br />Taking two rounds to wind up and then a third round to do three times damage is no different than doing a regular hit for each of those three rounds.<br /><br />The advantage is being able to carefully control when you release that burst, since there are many pets that have damage avoidance abilities.<br /><br />This is a primary argument for having a S/S breed. Being fast lets you know you can hit unchallenged. If you go last, your opponent might pull off one of those annoying avoidance abilities before you get your hit in.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>776458</b></h3>I must have the worst luck ever. <br />I pop on my ally hunter to get the pets in the ally cities and starting zones, etc. I see there's a couple in Dun Morogh I need so I go there. One is called &quot;Irradiated Roach&quot; so I figure &quot;hey, the area outside Gnomer makes sense, right?&quot;<br />Well, I get to the Toxic Airfield and instead of roaches there are Fluxfire Felines. Which for some reason didn't come up on the list when I searched &quot;Dun Morogh&quot; in my battle pet journal. So I'm stoked &quot;yay, two pets in one area!&quot; <br />I find one roach. One. And it's poor. I figure &quot;oh well&quot; and I kill it. The place is crawling with felines so I figure once I get rid of some of those trying to find a rare it'll make room for more roaches.<br />Well, it's been at least 2 1/2hrs now. I've widened my kill-zone range to the bank of Iceflow Lake, the hills above Gnomer, inside Gnomer where Gnomes now start, and down to just above Frostmane Hold. <br />I have not seen one more single battle pet roach. Anywhere. And it seems the more I kill, (and I'm killing every critter, battle pet or not) the less the felines spawn. <br />There's no one else here, it's just me.<br />I'm glad I managed to snag an uncommon feline because I'm about to give up. The roaches that do respawn seem to do so rather quickly but aren't battle pets. Very frustrating.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1062573</b></h3>I have tested out a lot of pets, and I really want to stress, this may very well be the best Mechanical pet in the game, and I highly recommend getting a rare version of this pet and leveling it asap. It is an extremely overpowered pet that can take out multiple enemies at once against certain comps.<br /><br />The real trick to this pet involves the combination of Wind-Up and Supercharge. It takes 3 turns to do all these abilities (one turn to cast Wind-Up the first time, one turn to cast Supercharge, and one turn to cast Wind-Up the second time), but at level 25 this will do approximately 2000 damage, enough to one-shot almost any pet even against the strongest trainers. I don't know of any pet that can match this type of damage with the exception of <a href="/npc=54027/lil-tarecgosa">Lil' Tarecgosa</a> ; however, Lil' Tarecgosa can only do this damage when combining Surge of Power after having killed an enemy pet, so it is far less versatile.<br /><br />One of the exceptionally unique things about this is that you can &quot;bank&quot; the first two turns in your pocket and then use the third turn at will. Both Supercharge and the first cast of Wind-Up are buffs of infinite duration, so you can cast these two abilities while the enemy has a weak-hitting pet out, move Fluxfire Feline to the backline, then pull it out in order to one-shot a hard-hitting pet before it can kill Fluxfire. Even if you aren't going to move Fluxfire to the backline, you can still pre-cast Wind-Up on a weak pet as long as you finish the enemy off with Claw. This is ridiculously powerful and can be used to great advantage.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1062573</b></h3>If you're wondering why your feline seems to occasionally die when it should have a &quot;second life&quot;, it appears that Supercharged prevents the fail-safe mechanisms from activating while it's on the target. I'm not sure if this is a bug or intended, but it seems to consistently happen with mine.<br /><br />EDIT: I was actually incorrect on it and got misled by seeing it happen many times. The cause of death is simply taking an enormous hit as the death-tick, the fact that Supercharged these times was active was just a coincidence. I'm leaving this up just to clarify this was WRONG, Supercharged does not cause the safety mechanism to not activate.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1073432</b></h3>I came up with a combo for Fluxfire that had potential to do incredible damage (as if Fluxfire's damage wasn't op already lol), and a friend of mine who has his at level 25 already tried it out for me. Started with Fluxfire doing Windup followed by Overtune and then swapped out for a pet that had with Howl (enemy takes 100% extra damage for two rounds). Then he swapped Fluxfire back in and used Overtune for the second time. Since the Fluxfires damage buffs do not have a round duration they were both still in effect, and stacked with the bonus damage granted from howl. Against a beast type he pulled off over 6k (strong) uncrit damage in a single shot. Admittedly its an incredible overkill, but the fact that its possible is hilarious. We haven't seen the combo crit yet although we plan to keep trying lol.<br /><br />EDIT: I stand corrected. Yeah I meant to say Supercharge and not Overtune but in my sleepiness I named the wrong ability (apparently repeatedly) &gt;_&lt;;;. Thanks for pointing out my mistake so I can correct it :).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1062573</b></h3><a href="/npc=68838/fluxfire-feline">Fluxfire Feline</a> is a somewhat dangerous and increasingly common pet to see in PVP battles due to the &quot;I can one-shot you in 3 turns&quot; mechanics (Wind-Up + Supercharged + Wind-Up). A somewhat novel way to counter this pet is with <a href="/item=73905/darkmoon-zeppelin">Darkmoon Zeppelin</a> . Note that <a href="/item=87526/mechanical-pandaren-dragonling">Mechanical Pandaren Dragonling</a> is an identical pet (in terms of the abilities you will be using) and thus works as well, but comes as Uncommon by default, meaning you have to get a stone to upgrade it first. I'll be referring to the Zeppelin in the explanation for this reason, but the two are obviously interchangeable.<br /><br />First of all, you'll be equipping Thunderbolt in the tier 1 slot, not surprising, since it does extra damage to mechanical. You'll basically be Thunderbolting them to death with a few exceptions where you'll be using Decoy.<br /><br />The real trick is Decoy in the tier 2 slot however. This ability will absorb 2 incoming attacks, which by default works well against one-hitting attacks that only occur every few turns, like the Fluxfire Feline's. Now, there's a few ways that this can play out:<br /><br />1) If your Zeppelin is faster than their Fluxfire:<br />This is a little bit of a simpler situation. You can wait until you see the opponent cast Supercharged and then drop the Decoy on the next turn. This will cause their Supercharged attack to get absorbed with the decoy, wasting their 3 turns of preparation as well as putting their Supercharged on cooldown. They'll then follow up with a tier 1 attack to break your Decoy, at which point you'll be back to a slug-fest.<br /><br />If the opponent is smart, they'll realize what you intend to do with Decoy and try to attack a turn early. At a bare minimum, this will prevent them from using a Supercharged combo, but will still hit hard. If you anticipate your opponent trying this, you should drop your Decoy a turn early. THIS will do one of two things. If they Wind-Up a second time as you expect, you'll now absorb 2 turns with the attacks, and they'll still need to use their tier 1 attack once before they can start up again. Well worth the effort. If they Supercharge instead, unless they're stupid, they'll follow up with tier 1 attacks for 2 turns; however, this will still burn their Supercharge as it will get used up in the first tier 1 attack absorbed by Decoy.<br /><br />2) Your Zeppelin is slower<br />Same idea, except now you have to anticipate your opponents moves a little better. If you think they're going to use a full-out 3-turn one-shot, then you need to drop your decoy on the turn that they're going to Supercharge so that it's up when they're ready to one-shot. Unless your opponent is naive, they'll now use two tier 1 attacks to break the Decoy, which will preserve their Wind-Up charge but will waste Supercharged.<br /><br />If your opponent is smart enough to not waste a Supercharged Wind-Up because they know you're going to Decoy, then you need to drop Decoy on the first turn. This is obviously the least effeective case as it no longer wastes either Supercharged or a Wind-Up charge, but it will still draw 2 turns of their attacks in exchange for just 1 turn of dropping the Decoy. That is, unless they open with Supercharged instead of Wind-Up, in which case you still waste one of their cooldowns.<br /><br />In either case, you should be able to delay for enough turns to kill the Fluxfire; remember that both you and the Fluxfire rez on death. Luckily, your tier 1 talent hits substantially harder than theirs (due to it being elemental), so you should easily beat them if you get into a tier 1 slug-fest, with their only advantage being if they combine both Wind-Up and Supercharged.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1062573</b></h3>Be aware that Blizzard has confirmed this pet is going to be nerfed in patch 5.2. If this pet is an important part of your lineup for certain trainers, be ready to replace it. They're replacing Supercharge with an aoe ability, hence removing the 3-turn one-shot combo.<br /><br />That doesn't mean this pet will become worthless though; it just won't be the nearly unbeatable powerhouse it is right now. It still has a good lineup of a Beast attack (either Claw or Pounce pending your relative speed to the enemy's) and Wind-Up; since Critters and Beasts are common enemies against trainers at the moment, this is still a good combo of abilities. <br /><br />Also, it sounds like they're not removing Prowl, so you can still do ONE god-powered ability every 5 turns. That being said, with Prowl being the big ability now, there's no longer nearly as much reason to use a high-speed Fluxfire. If your goal is to use a 3-turn one-shot, you're going to have to be 30% slower by the time the final turn moves around, and it's nearly impossible that you're going to be the faster pet under any situation with this limitation, so you might as well go for the high-power variant.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>662743</b></h3>I had to get one of these cats to see what all the talk was about and I have to admit, he hits harder than any of my other pets so far.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Entilzha2161</b></h3>I've been testing rares of the two different breeds. The differences between the two at 25 rare are 293 damage and 325 speed compared to 332 damage and 289 speed, according to <a href="http://petsear.ch/Breeds" rel="nofollow">http://petsear.ch/Breeds</a> and my own pets. They both have the same amount of health.<br /><br />I find I win more with the speed model. This pet's attacks do so much damage, that if it does lose it's far more likely to be due to not getting that final attack in, than an attack not doing enough damage. The &quot;weaker&quot; DPS model can still get 4k+ crits, and can oneshot the vast majority of pets when Supercharged, so if you use a stone on one of these, I recommend going with the faster version to get as many hits in as possible.<br /><br />Edit: I've heard that this pet is to be be nerfed in 5.2 with Supercharge being removed and replaced with an AOE, but prowl will not, so you can only do a one-shotter every 5 turns instead of every 3, and are forced to reduce your speed anyway to do so, so if this is in fact the case then the power model will be the better choice; glad I have both leveled. I do not see evidence of this on the PTR as of yet but will post an update should that change.</div>

My lvl 25 fluxfire is always in my line up and I thought I had hit a bug because he did not have wind-up in either battle. Contrary to comments above, he still has supercharge and prowl, but wind up has been replaced with flux or overtune in 5.2. I haven't tried these yet so I don't know how hard they hit, but I can't see them as being as good. I guess the wind up supercharge combo was just to powerful to leave out there because with his rebirth ability about the only thing that didn't die on the 3rd turn was an elemental, unless he missed, which didn't happen very often.</div>

If you can get a <a href="/pet-ability=204/call-lightning">Call Lightning</a> effect from a Dragon Kite, Mechanical yeti or one of the 7 other pets with that move, you get a solid DPS boost and while not quite on the level of the old Fluxfire Feline move, should get the job done. <br /><br />You can also try making the platform then bringing in a pet to do <a href="/pet-ability=488/amplify-magic">Amplify Magic</a> to boost it even higher, but Ive found this impractical as the weather effect gives the rare Mechanopeep enough strength to take out most beast beasts of fable and it's too many swaps to be worth it in most cases.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sashila77</b></h3>Try going to Coldridge valley and kill or battle every pet you see then go to gnomeregan (check inside as well) and look around there. They'll start spawning there like crazy! I've found over 30 felines within mini map range of each other this way! <br /><br />It works cuz Coldridge is were the most concentrated amount of pets are in dun morogh. Apon killing them you make room for more pets. Inside and around gnomeregan is were Fluxfire Felines are most likely too spawn!</div>

I made a level 1 gnome on a Brazil server and found approx. 7 of them, but none rare. Then I did the same thing on a Latin America server and hit the jackpot. I found 20+ of them roaming around and now have a rare S/S and a rare P/S in my collection.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Posh</b></h3>Well, <br /><br />First off, I would like to apologize to the Wowhead community for not sharing this sooner. I have been guarding this secret forever because I wanted to make sure my close friends got their Fluxfire Feline pet first. Then of course over time it slipped my mind to share it with the community.<br /><br />I believe Wild Battle Pets are like any other herbing, mining and fishing nodes. If you mine only Saronite in a zone that shares Saronite with Cobalt ore, you will soon find the zone full of nothing but Cobalt Ore. Likewise fishing in a zone with two shared pools you will soon fish-out the type you want, and an overabundance of the one you don't want. Or in the case of Fluxfire felines, the zone soon becomes full of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=61690">Alpine Hares</a>, and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=61689">Snow Cubs</a>, and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=61080">Rabbits</a><br /><br />How this applies to Fluxfires is I believe the game server has a soft limit to how many &quot;battle pets&quot; can spawn. Since the Dwarf starting area <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/zone=6176">Coldridge Valley</a> has no enemies that eat the battle pets, the Dwarf starting area soon becomes a forest of green paws. Thus destroying the critters in the Dwarf starting area, allows for other battle pets to spawn in the zone. I was able to help many friends get their Fluxfire Felines this way. <br /><br /><b>The EASIEST way to catch a Fluxfire Feline without making gnomes on strange servers</b> is to go over the mountain to the Dwarven starting area of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/zone=6176">Coldridge Valley</a>. Here you will quickly see that there are dozens and dozens of wild battle pets. If you go on a battle pet killing spree till you can see no more paws on your minimap. Then fly immediately over to the area the fluxfires spawn. There will be between 3 and 6 Fluxfire Felines or <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=61691">Irradiated Roaches</a> spawned.<br /><br />Just keep doing this. This is how I got all my friends their Fluxfire felines. <br /><br />After a while, the battle pet distribution is more even in the zone, and so you need to go outside the dwarf starting area to &quot;clear them out&quot; but this trick still works. Once you have done this a few times, the zone battle pet concentration is pretty even, and this trick slows down. So at this point you drop the Fluxfire Feline hunt, and come back later. This is because the zone as a whole has more more natural enemies to critters, so these will eventually thin the zone wide battle pet concentration bringing it back to the Dwarven starting area. So give the server about 2 hours, you can come back and do this same trick again and it will work. Spawning between 2 and 3 Fluxfire Felines every time you go on a critter killing spree. Eventually though, the number of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/npc=61689">Snow Cubs</a> in the zone gets too much, since only rabbits and roaches are &quot;eaten&quot; by the various predators in the zone. To keep this trick working, you are forced to clean the cubs out eventually.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sabrines</b></h3>Tried every suggestion while on my Horde 90 on Suramar. Killing the battle pets around Dun Morogh and then flying back into Tinkertown did nothing, unless there was someone also doing pet battles there while I was doing this. Nothing spawned. So I went on my Level 1 Gnome that I've not felt like leveling and still nothing. There was ONE Irradiated Roach underground and it was uncommon. Bleck! Then I tried going onto Aerie Peak. Still nothing. I had been searching for 2 hours straight and hadn't even seen a Fluxfire Feline. Finally, I switched to the Latin American server Drakkari. FINALLY a Fluxfire. Alas, it was Uncommon. Battled all the pets there, and none yielded anything higher than a Common. Switched to the Brazil server Gallywix. 3 Fluxfire rares IN A ROW! Also, found a Rare Irradiated Roach on same server a few more battles in. Just a little tip to anyone not being able to find any on their US server!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>thadellese</b></h3>Can confirm if you make a level one Gnome on a low pop server you can get this pet very fast. Was flying around (Horde) on my server waiting for one to spawn and read someones tip on here... worked perfectly.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rakkasan</b></h3>This may have been nerfed. Have created L1 Gnomes on three different LA/Brazil servers and spent a couple of hours running around looking for these. Didn't see a single one.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Thaag</b></h3>You don't have to roll a new gnome or whatever. I did this on a 90 nelf druid I've had since LK. Went down there, started thinning the herd so to speak by pitting all the ambient pet battle creatures (mostly hares and snow cubs, one roach) against my myriad lvl 1 pets. Eventually the mecha-kitty spawned after about 7 battles.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Androceles</b></h3>As a horde side character I found this pet difficult to find.

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>JuneauEu</b></h3>Can confirm - easiest way to do this as horde, create a gnome, do the first 2-3 quests to get out of the starting area once you teleport upstairs, run outside, about 10 to catch nearby. Spent 20 mins on my Horde flying around with 0 to catch.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>beccanerd</b></h3>I figured an easy way of being in this area while this pet is spawned was to create new gnomes and by the second one, the pet was right in the start building in gnomeregan. To me, that's the easiest and quickest way to get this cat. (I needed for the crazy cat lady achievement for which I found a perfect guide: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa35OQeKRf0&amp;t=1292s" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa35OQeKRf0&amp;t=1292s</a>)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>FangedFaerie</b></h3>As of 7.3.2, the Fluxfire Feline is still found inside Gnomeregan (not the dungeon) and The Toxic Airfield of <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/new-tinkertown">New Tinkertown</a> where the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=48956/irradiated-roach">Irradiated Roaches</a> scurry around. You may have to battle and/or kill off the roaches to get the kitties to spawn, or you may want to create brand-new Gnome characters on other servers to find some (since pets are account-wide now). They still have a strangely dog-like death rattle. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Grammie</b></h3>found mine tonite @ 9:26 server time...there were several here...right outside the old dormitory</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BrittaBean91</b></h3>Finally caught this little dude this morning. Couldn't find it as my Horde character so I made a Gnome character (as most of the comments suggested that this was the best way to catch him). Unfortunately after 45 minutes, I hadn't caught anything but roaches. So, I logged onto my old Night Elf and hitched a ride to Dun Morogh from Stormwind. As soon as I arrived, there was nothing but Fluxfire Felines! After four battles I was able to catch a rare one. Good luck everyone!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>CaptainWater</b></h3>Followed the advice of other comments and made a gnome character on a &quot;New Players&quot;-server. Found a true abundance of the kittens without having to even leave the starting area.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>series6</b></h3>Just make a gnome and there are some in the start area.<br /><br />Come in S/S and P/S breeds. Grab one of each. although I use the P/S more.<br /><br />1st - Claw or Pounce<br />2nd - Flux or Overtuned<br />3rd - Prowl or Supercharge<br /><br />Get 1 of each breed as you will use them for the Pandaria 'Beasts of Fable'.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>yesrod1972</b></h3>I went looking for this pet and saw plenty of them but none that shown the cage capture icon. For some reason, these pets do not display the familiar green paw print icon but can still be caged.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Helianthus394</b></h3>I read the comments here and decided to try my luck since I only needed one more cat for the Crazy Cat Lady title.. I made a Gnome, and the moment I logged in there was one right in front of me in the very start (The Old Dormitory inside Gnomeregan). Iâ€™m assuming no one was here hunting for it at that time. Or Iâ€™m just lucky. Anyway, good luck to all of you other Crazy Cat Lovers out there!</div>
