<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>MyPetsAreEpic</b></h3>A really strong pet when your enemy can't hide or stun.<br /><br />First <a href="/pet-ability=541/chew">Chew</a>, than <a href="/pet-ability=376/headbutt">Headbutt</a>. High damage, low cooldowns.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>nobleknight</b></h3>Can only be found in the daytime (not sure about the evening, but definitely in the early afternoon/broad daylight). I searched all over Loch Modan for an hour last night (between midnight and 2 am) and didn't see a single one. Flew in from Dun Morogh at noon today, and there was one right there on top of a hill waiting for me. They were all over the place at that point - just circle the outside edge of Loch Modan and watch the hill tops.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mairin</b></h3>2/3 of these little guys have decided to perch on hills in just search a way that they constantly obscure the battle area. Occasionally they'll wander into the kill zone but usually easier to just check around the rest of the circuit when hunting your rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Huron</b></h3>Some of the spawns come up inside a tree or mountain, but you can /tar Little to select them and then use the &quot;Interact With Target&quot; keybind to still battle them.<br /><br />Sometimes this will give an error that the area is obscure, just move around a little.<br /><br />After a lot of laps around the map and 50+ battles, I still had not found a rare.<br />But one of the &quot;invisible&quot; spawns that I used this technique on was the rare I needed :)<br /><br />Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hashupa</b></h3>I found this critter spawning as early as 3:30am server time. They vary from level 3-5 and sometimes are accompanied by another critter.<br /><br />Also wanted to mention I found a rare. Level 3 with 266 health, 33 attack and 33 speed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Mantrhax</b></h3>well, +30% of the pet are in areas called obstructed...smart !</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Pinkiepieisfly</b></h3>I had gotten this little guy on beta and really wanted it on live, so based on another user, I made a nub on an Oceanic server as well (I decided this at 9 PM &gt;_&gt;).<br /><br />I had a choice between leveling or possibly dying nonstop looking for my ram. I picked the second one.<br /><br />I began my journey at level 6. Upon entering Loch Modan, I didn't want to run around since I would aggro anything easily and die. But here's the nice part: I didn't have to.<br />There were several Little Black Rams on the mountains near Valley of Kings. <br />Desperate, I walked down the road and noticed a little path up a hill, with a ram sitting right on top! <br /><br />Entirely nub-friendly :) If anyone else is as desperate for a ram, this is worth a shot.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>BLurker</b></h3>I flew into Loch Modan just after 2am realm time and there were not any to be found. Around 2:15am, I encountered one, and began to see them more regularly after that. These little guys appear to be early risers. Also of note, the first 10-15 I found were all poor quality, no common or uncommon, and then I finally found my rare at 2:35am realm time.<br /><br />Lastly, for those dealing with obscured battle area and uneven terrain messages, note that the battle area is determined by where you're standing, not where the pet is. So, do move around and try it from as many angles as you can find. Of all the Little Black Rams I found, I was able to engage in battle with every single one, even though a couple took several tries.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>souloist</b></h3>can comfirm was on at 16:52 st no little rams as soon as 16:58 hit they started spawning by 17:00 they were everywhere</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Dracornis</b></h3>It's 5 am now and i see plenty of them.<br />So i can confirm that they spawn at daylight..<br /><br />i will look back here in some future night to check the spawns at night</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maricah</b></h3>These little buggers get stuck in the trees a LOT, so expect that. I'm still having a personal hard time getting a rare, but uncommon isn't really that hard.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>899427</b></h3>To interact with the stuck little black rams:<br /><br />- the obstructed area, remember that this goes from where YOU are standing not from where the actual pet is running. after a few steps left and right and back and forth i found there is ALWAYS a way to interact with them.<br /><br />- to counter the ones that are stuck in trees is: simply (you can also macro it i personally did not) type &quot;/tar little&quot; when you are close to it. <br />now go to your keybindings scroll down to the &quot;targeting function&quot; tabs and bind &quot;interact with target&quot; to whatever key you want. press the freshly bound button with your little black ram targeted (remember to reposition yourself if you get the other issue again:)) and tadaa say hello to your new member of the team!<br /><br />hope this helped! happy hunting^^<br /><br />*edit* Also for the time issue, I found mine (and plenty of them too) around 5.30 AM servertime.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Moocifer</b></h3>Took me about 30 minutes to get my rare, and the tips about binding the &quot;interact with target&quot; key is the winner. It makes it way easier to revolve round one of these just spamming a key until it works. Also get right high up in the snow line on the right hand side, there were loads up there.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Batranger</b></h3>Thanks for the info, I found mine 10am server time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Brunhill</b></h3>Got my rare on a snowy mountain top north of the Southgate pass. Cruised this whole area late last night and none were out, but they are now @8AM realm time so the &quot;daylight only&quot; info seems legiminate. You cant capture the ones that are obscured in the trees, so just move on. Hilltops is where to find them. I probably went thru a dozen different pet battles until I got this little guy and yes, he is so cute! Have fun hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Maenea</b></h3>The map pins above are misleading, they are not rare but they are also NOT easy to see and not in the open grassy areas. These lovely LITTLE beasts are on the tops of hills, often in the trees or underbrush and hard to see. I used a keybinding for &quot;interact with target&quot; and the macro:<br /><br />/tar little bl<br />/script SetRaidTargetIcon(&quot;target&quot;, 4)<br /><br />This put a green triangle on the pet and made it visible even through terrain... then I spammed the target macro and the &quot;interact&quot; key, so that all I had to do was fly around, let the target be found and land, engage, and capture... caught 3 greens within 5 mins and then a rare was caught next.<br /><br />Confirming server time as 5:15 PM. I've checked on prior visits by flying in at night (after 9 PM server time) and did not see any of these in the zone.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Arsonist</b></h3>Found 1 at 1.45 AM near Ogre mound. Do spawn at night</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Haxan</b></h3>They are avaliable from at least 9 in the morning, caught mine at that time.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>raicarter</b></h3>The level 5-6 ones can be joined by either a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=61142">snake</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=61081">squirrel</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=61071">small frog</a>, or <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=61384">cockroach</a>. Like previous commenters have said move around for obstruction messages and use their targeting macro and interact keybind.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Heimdallen</b></h3>I started hunting for these around 23:30 server time, and I found a total of 8 of them scattered around the map. Interesting things of note were:<br /><br />1. Half of them were located on the shores of the...well, what is left of, the lake, and not near any hills.<br />2. The only hills they were found in were right near the ogre area, to the north on the border with the wetlands. They were literally in the hills, difficult to engage in battle due to terrain, and I had to leave 1 because there was no way to find a spot in which it would left me start a battle, too small a rock.<br />3. I scoured EVERY inch of the map and spent near an hour doing it, and never did I see one respawn. The respawns were squirrels and snakes and frogs and rats.<br />4. Never found one as a secondary pet.<br /><br />This led me to the conclusion that they must only spawn during the day, sometime earlier than when I was there from 23:30 to 00:30, and I was finding the leftovers. Also, since I found them right on the lake shore out in the open grass, they apparently don't just spawn in the hills. <br /><br />Just listing my experiences for the info to be learned from it, for whatever it's worth.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kruskal24</b></h3>just found one at 9pm server time.... so it can be found at night as well.... sadly I didn't realize it was so rare and a careless crit killed it :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Secksysparks</b></h3>Just to let people know - this pet does spawn in the evening and in abundance. I started farming for mine around 9:30pm eastern time and got my blue/rare around 10:30pm. Happy hunting =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Sabrines</b></h3>Starting 3pm realm time, I flew south along the mountains between Loch Modan and Dun Morogh. First 20 minutes encountered nothing but a bunch of Uncommons and 2 Commons. Finally at 3:24pm realm time, came across a Rare. I did get a secondary Rare Small Frog in the process.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Narillan</b></h3>Definitely didn't find any spawns of these at 11:30pm Pacific. I had to log on earlier during the day to find any. Lots of spawns then so these little rams have an early bedtime.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>kittykungirl</b></h3>I just caught an uncommon, 4:10pm pst. Cords were 34,21, all over the little mountain.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Zakaryyxo</b></h3>Unaware if this is correct but this pet only comes in two breeds. Yet, my battle breed addon says I came across a &quot;H/S&quot; type. It was a level 3 poor quality pet, had 18attack power and 27 speed. That does not compare to the other two breeds?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>DrLambda</b></h3>Most addons that show you the breed when you battle wild exemplars of this pet will get the breed wrong. This is probably an issue because the educated guessing the addon does isn't perfect for low-level pets of low quality. If you find one that the addon shows as H/S, it's a B/B. If it shows B/B, it can be either a true B/B or a P/B, you pretty much have to catch it before the addon knows which one it is for sure. <br /><br />I caught about 6 B/Bs before one of them magically turned into a P/B in my collection.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>HolgerDK</b></h3>Just caught one in Loch Modan at 19.39/7.39PM. Either way the spawn time been changed or its a left over spawn from early this morning.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>bomigabster</b></h3>Just caught one at 1 a.m server time. Did a quick fly over a small section in the north west corner of Lock Modan and saw four all up. Unfortunately due to the terrain, I couldn't battle two of them due to the terrain causing the area to be obstructed, so finding a rare would probably be a pain.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Weper</b></h3>I found one at 08:49 (CEST) with B/B breed and one at 08:56 (CEST) with P/B breed.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Kupotek</b></h3>The game won't let me trap a &quot;Little Black Ram&quot; in Loch Modan because it says I have 3 of them already... but I actually don't have even one of them and the zone notice confirms that as well as my pet inventory list ingame. So that's interesting.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>D3adLy</b></h3>Not 100% sure about this, but these guys may spawn more frequently during the day. I looked for them around 10 PM ST on 2 different servers, flying circles around for a total of 30 minutes. There were none to be found. Next day I rolled up early in the morning and right as I entered Loch Modan, came across 2 of them.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Jazeriel</b></h3>Just found one at 23:58 server time...</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Bukama</b></h3>Just collected one at 18:04:43 CET on a EU-Server. So early hours is still not a thing in 10.2.0 (as written a lot for further patches)</div>
