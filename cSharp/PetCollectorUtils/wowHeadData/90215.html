<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>hootstwo</b></h3>Interestingly, you can actually upgrade K'ute's level using leveling stones. It doesn't reflect a level in my pet journal, but when summoned, if you focus on K'ute, it DOES reflect a level increase.<br /><br />I logged on an off again just to see if the leveling persisted, and it did. I have no idea if this was intended, but I've currently got a level 4 K'ute :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ncnash083</b></h3>I just got this pet today, are the chimes not continuous? It played them right when I call the pet out for the first time but it cuts off after a few seconds.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>ilovenofight</b></h3>K' ute is such a big help upon calling pepe if you need to get pepe before going to a certain dungeon or raid for the achievement 'What A Strange, Interdimensional Trip It' s Been!' <br /><br />Stand near the tree with K' ute, then he will call pepe. Pepe will then glide down himself from the tree and go where K' ute is.. such a lovely scenario for an animal lover like me *winks*</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lorgion</b></h3>This is such an odd reward. Collecting battle pets to receive a non-battle-pet. Blizzard really missed an opportunity here. The reward should have been Lil'Idan (or whatever the naming convention would be for Illidan Stormrage), walking around with his legendary twin-blades slaying critters left and right and yelling to them that YOU ARE NOT PREPARED!, I CAN FEEL YOUR HATRED!, STARE INTO THE EYES OF THE BETRAYER! or WITHOUT ME YOU ARE NOTHING! Instead we got this fail of a reward floating about making chime-noise.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Alirana</b></h3>For the shadow priests out there.<br /><br />Using <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=87392/glyph-of-shadowy-friends">Glyph of Shadowy Friends</a> makes <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=90215/kute">K'ute</a> look like <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=25741/muru">M'uru</a>.<br /><br />Only adds epicness to this pet, if you ask me :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Hippiebabe</b></h3>&quot;When this pet is near, calming chimes fill your mind and remind you of a time long passed.&quot;<br /><br />I wonder if this is a reference to the Warlords of Draenor alternate timeline, or long before the Burning Crusade's existence, while the Draenei lived peacefully on Argus as uncorrupted Eredar.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>stickshift</b></h3>Occasionally, when other pets (and npc critters) pass close to your K'ute, they are swayed by the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=180670/touch-of-the-naaru">Touch of the Naaru</a>.<br /><br />After running Hyjal Summit <b><i>33</i></b> times, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=17968/archimonde">Archimonde</a> finally dropped a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=122112/hyjal-wisp">Hyjal Wisp</a> (the WORST possible last pet to have to grind for this achievement.)<br /><br />In defiance of the RNG gods I burned an <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=122457/ultimate-battle-training-stone">Ultimate Battle-Training Stone</a> on my new K'ute and, seeing as it does nothing when you click on it, named it <i>&quot;Chimeless&quot;</i>.<br /><br />Ranks up there with the finest pets visually but thankfully this grind has ended...or has it?<br /><br />Patch 6.2 Update: As Azarii stated; this pet now rings constantly and has a new clickable sound. Undaunted, I've now renamed mine &quot;<i>Overchime</i>&quot;.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Ethandrial</b></h3>Whilst I love this pet, truly I do. When the calm song I enjoy just abruptly stops after about 5 seconds it makes me want to shed a single tear. If it can't fight, the song is all that is left (apart from all the lore and just the sheer beauty of the creature). I guess it's a glitch but I really hope they fix that. The song is what makes me love it so much!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LiriellGarrosh</b></h3>I had this pet summoned while afk'ing in my garrison mine when I was attacked by a Frostwall Goren. As I was getting back to the WoW window, I heard the quiet, almost-whisper, sound file from AQ40, &quot;You... will... die&quot;. If this did come from K'ute, it could be a handy pet to have active while tabbing out to look something up, while your toon is in a dangerous area, sort of like an alarm system. <br /><br />Hmm, I found a couple more Frostwall Goren in my mine, and they did not cause the sound file to play.
