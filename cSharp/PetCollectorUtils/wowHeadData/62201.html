And I mean that literally, I only log out to sleep. I have been camping for a rare, which I have not found yet, but I found plenty of uncommon ones and lesser ones, when I first started a lot of people were camping as well, this is the main issue. Around 4:30-5am when no one was around the ENTIRE group of them respawned at once. I assume this happens on a very long respawn rate. I'm waiting to see when it happens again so I can know for sure, but it's 7:30am now and still no respawn. In fact I have not even seen any singular ones and I have not logged out yet. Although, I believe sometimes yesterday I saw a few single spawns, unless those were just missed ones from the major respawn.\n\nNo one else was around during the major spawn so I got a chance to check them all, and none were under 587 hp, which is the uncommon spawn. I hear the rare spawn is 732 or something like that, but that might be the rate after capture, I'm not sure if that changes or not but I haven't seen any anywhere near 700 in my two and a half days of camping. Anyone who knows the respawn rate for the big group, please let me know, or if there is any other information about the rares, like a certain area they spawn?\n\nThe spawn amount of the big group was around maybe 20 or more. It was a pretty huge group, all around the entire cave opening and into the swamps a bit, maybe even 30 of them.\n\nEDIT: It is now 10am and have not seen a single spawn again yet. At least a 5 hour spawn timer. I'm guessing it's more like 10-12 hours.\nEDIT: 10:50am and two showed up, one uncommon and another lesser one.\nEdit: 11:50am now and ever since the first two showed up there has been two or so spawning every 5-10 minutes or so.

Pet battles usually only lasted 1 to 2 minutes.  I didn't track exactly if it was initiating the battle or ending the battle that started the 10-minute timer, suffice to say if you found one at 10:37, battled, and found another 10:41, and battled, you would again see one each at 10:47 and 10:51 respectively.  This is a pattern that went on for several hours.  If at any time one didn't spawn, that I saw, sure enough if I looked around hard enough I would find somebody else in the area ... usually doing their best to try to stay out of my sight by either flying through trees nearby or up much higher.  it's also easy to miss others since it's best to fly around solely looking at your mini-map for critters to pop up.\n\nI have identified 8 specific spawning sites.  The 3 most common locations, in order from best to worst (personal experience only) are the South side, Northwest point, Northeast point.  After nearly 18 hours of trying to find a rare Spawn, I finally found one ... and it was the one and only time I saw one on the exact East-side of the cave.  Not trying to imply anything about the East-side spawn, just telling it how it was.\n\nIt always spawns as a level 12.\n\nMy pet of choice to capture with it is my Rocket Chicken, as it will do 100-160 damage per hit with \"Missile\", and I can use a 50-80 point hit (\"Squawk\") when I need small amounts of damage to get the Spawn below 35% and ready for capture.  As a bonus, Squawk reduces damage taken for 3 rounds, and it's 3rd ability, Extra Plating, reduces damage for 2 rounds and produces zero damage.  I would cast Extra Plating when Spawn cast \"Dive.\"  I find I can usually tame it while using only the Rocket Chicken.  Since most people do not have this pet, I suggest something that has some defensive moves and\/or heals.\n\nOnce I figured both spawns were on 10-minute timers, I adjusted my battle rate to get the second one to spawn shortly after I finished with the first one, so that I'd have 7-8 minutes between sets of spawns so that I could farm the [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/npc=4324]Searing Whelps[\/url].  On my 82nd kill (according to Rarity addon), I received a [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/item=10822]Dark Whelpling[\/url] pet.\n\nIt should also be noted that it would usually take me 3 to 4 attempts to capture each Spawn, made more frustrating from the Spawns ability to heal large amounts.  It is recommended to get the achievement for capturing 50 battle pets and thus earn the use of the [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=77\/strong-trap]Strong Trap[\/url] (or get the [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=135\/pristine-trap]Pristine Trap[\/url], if possible).  This will speed up your process and reduce the number of headaches that occur.\n\nThe macro will save you a lot of time (due to not trying to capture Spawns that aren't Rare):\n[quote]\/run hooksecurefunc(\"PlaySoundKitID\", function(Q) if Q==31584 then for i=1,C_PetBattles.GetNumPets(2) do SELECTED_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(C_PetBattles.GetName(2,i)..\" - \".._G[\"BATTLE_PET_BREED_QUALITY\"..C_PetBattles.GetBreedQuality(2,i)]) end end end) [\/quote]\nCopy that macro and use it ONCE per login.

I dove in so no one could steal it from me, it was a mere poor but who cares! I caught it! Happy with myself and nothing to do, I decided to keep going. Not even a few feet after the enterance to the raid there was another! I dove in again before a horde could steal it, to my surprize it was a common!

I never camped in this section longer than 5 minutes then i would go on to my quest in capturing the seemingly invisible, non-spawning Minfernal.  \r\n\r\nI would do this routine on different times of the day.

I trembled when my mouse pointer indicated \"Spawn of Onyxia\". My mind went blank due to this unexpectation. \r\n\r\nFor a second, in anticipation, i did not know what to do. Do I have the right line up of my battle-pets so as not to accidentally kill this beauty? I told myself, \"Don't screw this up!\".

Tail sweep is exceptionally strong when Spawn of Onyxia is slower than its opponent, so much so that you want to be going last when using this pet.\n\nThis means the best breed to aim for is #4 (P\/P) because any points spent on speed are basically wasted. Breed #10 (P\/B) is the second most favourable, and offers a few extra HP at the cost of attack power, but unfortunately still wastes some stats on speed. Breed #8 (P\/S) is arguably the weakest.\n\nTactically, this pet works very well against most opponents, and does especially well against faster opponents (almost everything), aquatic and magic families and creatures with flying attacks. It also does well against opponents dependent on big attacks with long cooldowns, because it has two abilities to mitigate such attacks.\n\nThe key to using this pet well is being able to anticipate enemy actions (pretty much all the daily trainers, Pandarian elemental spirits and beasts of fable are very predictable once you get to know them) - and if you can plan 3-4 moves ahead, the Spawn of Onyxia is exceptionally adept against most opponents.\n\nThe standard rotation I employ with this little fella is as follows:\n\n[ul]\n[li]Open with a Tail Sweep[\/li]\n[li]If your opponent hit in the first round, follow up with a Healing Flame, or alternatively, if your opponent didn't hit you in the last round, Tail Sweep again and wait a turn to heal once your opponent has actually hit you. Since the Spawn of Onyxia goes second your heal will heal for most of the first 2 attacks[\/li]\n[li]Lift Off[\/li]\n[li]Tail Sweep[\/li]\n[li]Healing Flame[\/li]\n[li]Tail Sweep until Healing Flame is available again, then start again because all your abilities will be off CD.[\/li]\n[\/ul]\n\nI will however deviate from this rotation when I know my opponent has one or more key abilities.\n\nLift Off is very handy to dodge big attacks. For example use Lift Off on the same round that you know your opponent will use [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=159] Burrow[\/url]\/[url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=564]Dive[\/url]. Alternatively use it in the round before something like [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/petability=508]Moth Dust[\/url] (hits hard and has a chance of putting your pet to sleep) or else anything that puts a nasty dot on you.\n\nSecondly, because Healing Flame adds additional healing equal to half of the last hit you took, it is often beneficial to time it for the rounds in which you know a big hit will land, but Lift Off is on CD.\n\nThirdly, the dragonkin special ability makes it do serious bonus damage (+50%) in the round after dealing any hit that leaves your opponent below 50% health. However this buff does not reapply itself if it is already active. If it drops off however, hitting an opponent again leaving it below 50% (or dead) will reapply the buff for another round. What this means is that if you trigger this buff with a hit that gets your opponent below 400 or so hp, it is often worth using either Healing Flame followed by a Tail Sweep, or alternative Lift Off, to get the killing blow. This would result in the buff being up for the first round against the next opponent, instead wasting the buff to do 600+ damage to a pet on 200 health.\n\n\nIf you are fortunate enough to own an Onyxian Whelpling, teaming it together with a Spawn of Onyxia makes for a duo that can reliably take down most daily trainer teams by themselves without even needing a third pet - meaning you can use them to power level your other pets.  Even against teams where this pairing is not ideal, I almost always have a spot for Onyxian Whelpling in my lineup. \n\nFor people who sadly don't have an Onyxian Whelpling available to them, Spawn of Onyxia is a great substitute, which does almost as well, and you'll definitely be wanting at least 2 of these. I strongly suggest saving a [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/item=92683]Flawless Dragonkin Battle-Stone[\/url] (or 2) for just this purpose, since farming for a rare of a specific breed can be somewhat time consuming and frustrating.","date":"2013-04-10T10:37:04-05:00","rating":98,"indent":0,"roles":256,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[{"body":"Wow.

After scanning the area, I found one pet on the southern side of the cave. What was irritating was that it was impossible to engage the pet in battle; the [i]\"Pet battle area is obstructed\"[\/i] message came up regardless of where the dragon flew. The dragon's flight pattern was completely out of synch with the geometry of the surrounding area. At several points, the dragon actually [i]flew directly into the mountain[\/i], as though the mountain was not even there. The pet could not  be seen, let alone engaged. \r\n\r\nEventually, I killed that pet, the only Spawn of Onyxia I could find, in hopes that it would cause another to spawn somewhere else. The tactic worked; on another circuit of the area, I found a Common white had spawned near the cave mouth. I had no problems engaging and capturing this second Spawn. If you encounter the problem I did, perhaps killing the uncapturable pet will cause another pet to spawn elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOn a secondary note, this is just one of many \"pet battle area is obstructed\" messages I have encountered while trying to battle or capture pets in hilly or mountainous terrain. Considering it has been two years since MOP released, this issue is glaring. [u]Why does Blizzard consistently create pet spawns on terrain that is not suitable for battling?[\/u] Dustwallow Marsh, Kun-Lai Summit, Grizzly Hills... these are just some of the areas with a high percentage of obstructed battle areas. Over and over I have patiently and methodically engaged multiple pets throughout their entire movement cycle, only to receive the \"pet battle area is obstructed\" message regardless of where I engage them in that movement cycle. It is an exercise in futility to find a rarely occurring animal and yet be unable to battle it.  I am surprised that Blizzard does not take these issues more seriously, and it causes me to question how much they even play their own product.\r\n\r\nWhatever section of Blizzard is responsible for QAing these pet spawns is ineffective at best and inept at worst. In any other profession, releasing a product that has a high percentage of non-working products is seen as an emergent issue that needs to be fixed immediately, or customers and revenue will be permanently lost. In contrast, Blizzard had had at least 24 months post-release to correct significant issues with pet battling, yet has a taken a unilateral attitude of \"We'll fix the issue when we get around to it.\"  There is no way in hell I could treat customers like that in my profession; I would be fired. \r\n\r\nYes, in theory WoW is just a game and not something \"serious\" like medicine, mechanical engineering, or contracting, but with millions of customers and billions of dollars in revenue over the last ten years, this is more than a game. WoW is a cultural influence. So why does Blizzard not thoroughly QA before release? Why do they expect paying customers to beta test the product for them? Over four years of playing, this uncomfortable conclusion is the one most consistent with the evidence I've seen. Maybe it is just a single Spawn of Onyxia that is poorly coded, but it feels more like an unsettling reminder that a once-trusted company has traded customer loyalty for financial profit. The administration really doesn't care how many customers they lose as long or how use-less the product becomes as their paychecks keep coming in. I got my Spawn of Onyxia, but I won't be coming back for another. If Blizzard continues this trend of putting \"uncapturable\" pets and sub-par\/non-existent QA in Warlords of Draenor, I won't be coming back at all.","date":"2014-06-29T14:57:13-05:00","rating":1,"indent":0,"roles":0,"deleted":0,"outofdate":0,"userRating":0,"replies":[],"dataTree":1,"markupDisabledEnvironments":{"ptr":true,"ptr2":true,"beta":true,"d4ptr":false}},{"commentv2":1,"number":63,"id":1988911,"nreplies":0,"sticky":0,"user":"Nevarii","body":"I'm using my  [url=http:\/\/www.wowhead.com\/item=93040]Anubisath Idol[\/url] (since it was level 13 and up to the current level, level 15) when I fight Spawn of Onyxia.

Which makes me wander if they don't show up certain time of day. Can anyone verify this?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>991468</b></h3>I finally got an uncommon Spawn of Onyxia. Here's what I know:<br /><br />I don't think there is any phasing problem. There are other pets in the area and I could see them fine. I think the problem is these guys are on a long spawn timer and only spawn a few at a time. <br /><br />I found one at 5:30 AM behind the lair. There wasn't anything special about the weather. Just normal Duskwallow Marshes.<br /><br />I accidentally killed the first one, which really sucked. But then I look right and I see a second one. So, I went and grabbed him, and got him in the cage.<br /><br />He was uncommon so I went to check the front to see if there were more for a chance at Rare, but nothing. I waited in the back for another five minutes and then hearthed out. <br /><br />So, I think they are on like a 10 minute timer and only 2 or so spawn at a time. I think we never see them because so many people are camping the spot during the day.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>shintorg</b></h3>Spawn rate seems very long. Spent 30min today camping it before doing the Older Tharemore trick with no luck. Another 30min after swapping to old Theramore and still no spawn. No other people around either. :(</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Morgwic</b></h3>I had some trouble getting a rare version of this, so I waited for server restart, and when I came back, there were these little dragons all over the place, and they would indeed respawn really fast for the first 10 minutes, and then slowly fade off. After about 25 of uncommons, commons, and poor quality Spawn of Onyxias I finally got my rare. <b>So your best bet is probably to wait for a server restart.</b><br /><br />Stats for my rare:<br />Level 12<br />Health 724<br />Attack 147<br />Speed 131</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lithae</b></h3>I have some possibly helpful information since I have been camping around Onyxia's Liar for almost 3 days now. And I mean that literally, I only log out to sleep. I have been camping for a rare, which I have not found yet, but I found plenty of uncommon ones and lesser ones, when I first started a lot of people were camping as well, this is the main issue. Around 4:30-5am when no one was around the ENTIRE group of them respawned at once. I assume this happens on a very long respawn rate. I'm waiting to see when it happens again so I can know for sure, but it's 7:30am now and still no respawn. In fact I have not even seen any singular ones and I have not logged out yet. Although, I believe sometimes yesterday I saw a few single spawns, unless those were just missed ones from the major respawn.<br /><br />No one else was around during the major spawn so I got a chance to check them all, and none were under 587 hp, which is the uncommon spawn. I hear the rare spawn is 732 or something like that, but that might be the rate after capture, I'm not sure if that changes or not but I haven't seen any anywhere near 700 in my two and a half days of camping. Anyone who knows the respawn rate for the big group, please let me know, or if there is any other information about the rares, like a certain area they spawn?<br /><br />The spawn amount of the big group was around maybe 20 or more. It was a pretty huge group, all around the entire cave opening and into the swamps a bit, maybe even 30 of them.<br /><br />EDIT: It is now 10am and have not seen a single spawn again yet. At least a 5 hour spawn timer. I'm guessing it's more like 10-12 hours.<br />EDIT: 10:50am and two showed up, one uncommon and another lesser one.<br />Edit: 11:50am now and ever since the first two showed up there has been two or so spawning every 5-10 minutes or so. I assume it will be the same amount as the large group spawn except timed over a certain amount of time instead of all at once.<br />Still no rares.<br /><br />Update: 12:55AM, Saturday, I found my first rare Spawn of Onyxia after three days of camping. The health before capture was 623, after capture it was 755. Nothing special about the location, right in front of the cave opening out in the swamp a bit.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>darcalyn</b></h3>Found mine (Uncommon) at 54, 82 after about an hour of late-night camping.<br /><br />I confirm that killing the few battle-pets around the lair share timer with spawn of Onyxia. It's much smaller than I expected though, almost killed it thinking it was a snake/mouse-- it's smaller than the Onyxian Whelpling too. It doesn't fly with you when you're on flying mount.<br /><br />Edit: Info about anyone wondering about Theramore phasing, I don't believe it actually affects the rest of the map so it doesn't matter what phase you are in currently.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Lilibet</b></h3>Flew around Onyxia's Lair and didn't see any spawns flying around. Resorted to killing/battling a few snakes and mice and after about 3 or 4 battles I got 4 spawns of Onyxia to appear. <br />After I'd fought them (2 grey, 1 white and 1 green quality) they stopped spawning again.<br /><br />My guess is that with another lot of surrounding pets gotten rid of they would've appeared again.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1044703</b></h3>Got my rare today at about 5pm PST. Do not just wait for these to spawn, you have to go around the area and kill the battle pets in the marsh and then go back to the spawn area around Onyxia's lair. Spawn of Onyxia only spawn in the circle right around the lair. As others have said, these pets share the spawn timer with all other battle pets, so waiting for them probably won't work. I captured about 8 common or poor spawns before I captured my rare.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Tsahil2clarg</b></h3>So, I just caught mine after looking for a few days. What I noticed is, killing other pets does nothing. BUT fighting them in a pet battle, seems to spawn another random pet nearby, be it mouse, toad, spider, or these cute little dragons. Try fighting some for a bit and one will pop up eventually. Just thought I'd add my two cents here.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>McKizz</b></h3>For those of you camping and critter killing while waiting for <a href="/npc=62201/spawn-of-onyxia">Spawn of Onyxia</a> to spawn, I recommend killing the nearby <a href="/npc=4323/searing-hatchling">Searing Hatchling</a>. While a low percentage, they have the chance to drop <b><a href="/item=10822/dark-whelpling">Dark Whelpling</a>.</b> Typically, two spawn outside the cave at the very south. There are several others within walking distance of Spawn of Onyxia spawn points.<br /><br />Again, the drop percentage is low, but why not take a chance?

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Rakesha</b></h3>I had an uncommon one spawn on me at 54,81 which is at the back end of the entrance to Onyxia's lair. It will do for now until I can luck out on a rare quality one. I am just happy to finally have one. :)<br /><br />I just wanted to say, I know on my server, Dustwallow Marsh is cross-realm, so there are quite a few people around. Some are actually just going around and KILLING any pets that spawn that you can battle. So just be warned, some people are apparently jerks and doing anything to prevent people from pet battling to get a chance at this pet. :/</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>959577</b></h3>Found rare first one I spotted, 12:21 PST (2:21am server) made a few loops just to see of I could find any others and got a poor one on the back side about 40 min later. I found my rare at 51, 73. Happy hunting!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Unpossible</b></h3>After many hours of farming on a low pop server, I can say that there are precisely two of these that spawn on independent 10-minute timers all around the cave area. Pet battles usually only lasted 1 to 2 minutes. I didn't track exactly if it was initiating the battle or ending the battle that started the 10-minute timer, suffice to say if you found one at 10:37, battled, and found another 10:41, and battled, you would again see one each at 10:47 and 10:51 respectively. This is a pattern that went on for several hours. If at any time one didn't spawn, that I saw, sure enough if I looked around hard enough I would find somebody else in the area ... usually doing their best to try to stay out of my sight by either flying through trees nearby or up much higher. it's also easy to miss others since it's best to fly around solely looking at your mini-map for critters to pop up.<br /><br />I have identified 8 specific spawning sites. The 3 most common locations, in order from best to worst (personal experience only) are the South side, Northwest point, Northeast point. After nearly 18 hours of trying to find a rare Spawn, I finally found one ... and it was the one and only time I saw one on the exact East-side of the cave. Not trying to imply anything about the East-side spawn, just telling it how it was.<br /><br />It always spawns as a level 12.<br /><br />My pet of choice to capture with it is my Rocket Chicken, as it will do 100-160 damage per hit with &quot;Missile&quot;, and I can use a 50-80 point hit (&quot;Squawk&quot;) when I need small amounts of damage to get the Spawn below 35% and ready for capture. As a bonus, Squawk reduces damage taken for 3 rounds, and it's 3rd ability, Extra Plating, reduces damage for 2 rounds and produces zero damage. I would cast Extra Plating when Spawn cast &quot;Dive.&quot; I find I can usually tame it while using only the Rocket Chicken. Since most people do not have this pet, I suggest something that has some defensive moves and/or heals.<br /><br />Once I figured both spawns were on 10-minute timers, I adjusted my battle rate to get the second one to spawn shortly after I finished with the first one, so that I'd have 7-8 minutes between sets of spawns so that I could farm the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=4324">Searing Whelps</a>. On my 82nd kill (according to Rarity addon), I received a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=10822">Dark Whelpling</a> pet.<br /><br />It should also be noted that it would usually take me 3 to 4 attempts to capture each Spawn, made more frustrating from the Spawns ability to heal large amounts. It is recommended to get the achievement for capturing 50 battle pets and thus earn the use of the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=77/strong-trap">Strong Trap</a> (or get the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=135/pristine-trap">Pristine Trap</a>, if possible). This will speed up your process and reduce the number of headaches that occur.<br /><br />The macro will save you a lot of time (due to not trying to capture Spawns that aren't Rare):<br /><div class="quote-box">/run hooksecurefunc(&quot;PlaySoundKitID&quot;, function(Q) if Q==31584 then for i=1,C_PetBattles.GetNumPets(2) do SELECTED_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(C_PetBattles.GetName(2,i)..&quot; - &quot;.._G) end end end) </div><br />Copy that macro and use it ONCE per login. Each time you enter a pet battle your chat box will show you the rarity of each Wild pet you are up against. Enjoy. Do not click this macro more than ONCE per character login.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Oshang</b></h3>This journey on finding the Spawn of Onyxia was horrible!<br /><br />It was only atleast 5mins into the journey, I was circling Onyxia's Lair and right behind it was one of the spawns! I went straight into battle with it! I was dearly hoping it was an uncommon or a rare, but with my luck it was a mere poor one. I was JUST about to catch it and it healed, so I had to throw another attack to weaken it. Nothing strong but just enough, but of course I had a critical hit! Down went the spawn and across my face went my hand.. <br /><br />I carried on going around and around, battling 80% of all the mice, spiders, snakes, toads, and rats I saw hoping it would speed up the spawn time and one of them would be an add with the battle. But nothing, 30mins passed of me circling. Hordes and Allies did the same hoping for one to show but they left after a while. I continued.<br /><br />Not even 45mins into the circling a spawn appeared! I dove in so no one could steal it from me, it was a mere poor but who cares! I caught it! Happy with myself and nothing to do, I decided to keep going. Not even a few feet after the enterance to the raid there was another! I dove in again before a horde could steal it, to my surprize it was a common! Hoping that the next would be an uncommon then a rare, I caught him and continued.<br /><br />A couple more poors and commons, I decided to log out for a bit and went onto my other toon to check its mail. Completely logging off I sat and played Officejerk on my iPod for a good 20mins before going back on, again, a couple more poors and commons.<br /><br />Roughly 30mins have passed, it's now been an hour into this, I feel like a volture circling a dead body.<br /><br />Nothing so far, a horde has been here for awhile doing what I'm doing. I feel like its a race to the death on who gets it first, me circling one way and him another. Nothing, not a single spawn. I would be happy with an uncommon or a rare, I wouldn't care at this point.<br /><br />I feel as if I was going insane, going around and around and around. There hasn't been a single pet I could battle for a good 15mins.<br /><br />Ah! a black rat! I went into battle hoping again to help the spawn time and get some of my sanity back.<br /><br />Drinking coffee and eating Halloween candy to keep me awake as I circle, I feel as if I was lost in a desert. Going in circles trying to find water but it never comes. Then all of a sudden, a spawn appeared! I rushed in and again, to my crappy luck it was a poor Spawn of Onyxia and a rare Chicken (which I already have) - oh have I wish it was the other way around.<br /><br />Next thing I know theres another, I walk over thinking its going to be nothing special and I go into battle.. AND ITS A RARE! I nearly yelled in joy! I went full out with my weak infected fawn (which I am using for these lower levels) - I got it's health down just enough and WHAM! I threw my strong trap and caught it! I did a bit of a dance (while trying not to fall off my bed)<br /><br />It's only taken me an hour and 40-50 something minutes but I got it!<br /><br />Now I can take this little guy off to level him up to 25 to match my Corehound Pup and Celestial Dragon!<br /><br />You just need some patience and time on your hands and you'll get the little guy!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>526868</b></h3>The best time to do this, to me, is right after a server reset. I never spent much time camping the area. I noticed that the server was down; I waited for it to reboot and logged on and flew over there and grabbed me 2 rares in about 10 mins. I did the same thing with the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62317/minfernal">Minfernal</a>.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Everliving14</b></h3>Here's a tip that no one (surprisingly) has mentioned:<br /><br />If you have characters on multiple realms, check the lair on ALL of them! As a case in point, on one server, I didn't see a single whelp after maybe an hour because of all the competition and bad luck. Then, I logged onto a character on a different realm, and suddenly the question became: Where is my rare? The place was teeming with spawns. <br /><br />The pet is completely worth it. At level 12, a common whelp hit opponents for 240 normal damage. With the heals and the flying, it is definitely eligible for a position on your core team.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>karwara</b></h3>I had to log a character on a non-pvp realm to get this. Some little saddo was attacking people as soon as they got a spawn. People who do this - you should be ashamed of yourselves! lol</div>

Killed all the battle pets around the lair over and over again to force the dragons to spawn - most were poor or common. Saw one green and finally one blue. It took rounds of killing about 20 pets or so to cause a Spawn of Onyxia to pop up. (killed 17, 20, 25 battle pets in between spawns). Sometimes two or three would come up at once, but that only happened twice. Good luck!</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>lickmycrit</b></h3>interesting story. I was looking for what dragon pet i wanted for my team, decided on this one, read some comments on the farming that people have gone through to get this pet, decided i was ready for the challenge because this pet looks awesome and people keep owning my pets with it. I went straight to the very front of onyxia's lair and what do you know? There was one lonely spawn of onyxia flying right there, i swooped down off my mount to start the battle, and to my suprise it was A RARE! Captured the rare spawn of onyxia on my very first try with less then 60 seconds of farming. Happened tuesday 7:17pm pacific time. Good Luck all! =)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1061316</b></h3>I don't know if its at all relevant but while I was searching out this pet I couldn't find ANY in the area. I proceeded to kill every critter I could find for 15/20 minutes... Still no spawn. I decided I was going to kill Onyxia, proceeded into the raid and downed her. Once I exited the raid there were half a dozen around the cave which is Onyxia's Lair. Was this a coincidence?</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>976574</b></h3>Out of interest, this might be daft, but i managed to obtain my Onyxian Drake a couple of days ago, to this i had actually missed my 5th anniversary achievement! So i went searching for the Spawn, i did obtain the spawn, however it cannot &quot;fly&quot; next to my mount, which was the sole purpose. My other drakes i own do appear to fly with me, but the Spawn appears to have a large mass, as it sinks to the ground or disappears when i fly. Would be nice to know if its because i have an uncommon version? Any feedback would be great. <br /><br />Cheers, Grooved.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>452816</b></h3>I was lucky. Went to the area and nothing was up. Ran around and killed every pet battle mob and critter and then the spawns popped. One uncommon and two poor</div>

During my countless trips to Felwood, i always passed by Dustwallow Marsh circling around the entrance to Onyxia's Lair in Wyrmbog area. As expected no Dragonkin in sight. I never camped in this section longer than 5 minutes then i would go on to my quest in capturing the seemingly invisible, non-spawning Minfernal. <br /><br />I would do this routine on different times of the day. Until 1 day at about 12:45 AM server time, as i pass by Onyxia's Lair, saw a solo green paw! I told myself is this another nonsense CRZ? but i realized I wasn't in a taxi. I trembled when my mouse pointer indicated &quot;Spawn of Onyxia&quot;. My mind went blank due to this unexpectation. <br /><br />For a second, in anticipation, i did not know what to do. Do I have the right line up of my battle-pets so as not to accidentally kill this beauty? I told myself, &quot;Don't screw this up!&quot;. I swooped down, then I saw a hovering drake on my peripheral vision, Crap! a level 90 horde. He must have been afk as he did not move while i continued to nosedive to my prey. The gods of luck must be on my side, It was a rare! I captured it carefully and did not bother going to Felwood, and afterwards laughed all the way to my sleep.<br /><br />A rare can spawn in some unexpected time. Although not a requirement for Kalimdor Safari Achievement, this is a new addition to any pet family. Have perseverance and your time will come. I'm now only missing a Minfernal and a Qiraji Guardling for the Zookeeper title.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1070246</b></h3>This takes some real patience to get, but once you do, it's one of the cutest, and most powerful pet in its family. I got a rare eventually, here's a mini-guide on how I did it:<br /><br />1. <b>Get to level 35 minimum</b>, though a high enough level to one shot the level 37-40 drakes flying around the place is recommended - they do get annoying.<br />2. This pet shares spawns with every other pet in the area. You'll probably make two, even three runs around Onyxia's mound and never see one. Patience is the key. <b>Kill every pet in the area</b> to speed up the process of finding the Spawn. This is easier done by killing them yourself than actually engaging in pet battles.<br />3. Keep going round and round, bashing all pets until you eventually find one. <b>Don't settle for poor or uncommon quality</b>. This is a pet you'll enjoy levelling, so go for uncommon, with rare being preferred. It took me close to 2 hours, but it was worth it.<br /><br />Also, this pet is not as good as <a href="/spell=69002/onyxian-whelpling">Onyxian Whelpling</a>. If you already have <a href="/spell=69002/onyxian-whelpling">Onyxian Whelpling</a>, you may as well not bother getting this at all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Velanthia</b></h3>Killed all the critters and pets in the area, not sure if that actually made a difference or not. This pet finally spawned on the back side of the Lair; I engaged it, it was Uncommon. Some jerkoff hit me just enough to pull me out of my battle. (Really tired of dealing with people via CRZ.) Since he didn't do anything after that, I thought maybe it was an accident and engaged the pet again. (Somehow it was still there.) He hit me AGAIN. I was a mage vs a warrior so of course he killed me easily. I finally found a Poor and captured it, then found a Common and captured that one. Didn't see a Rare. This all occurred around 3:30 server time on Korgath.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Neyrith</b></h3>found my lil' drake :) spent 1 min for searching her. Quality is common</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>LSavage</b></h3>This pet is one of the strongest battle pets that can be captured by means of pet battle. <br /><br />It is very similar to the awesome <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=36607">Onyxian Whelpling</a>, sharing both its appearance and abilities but with different stat allocations that make the Whelpling slightly stronger in most situations.<br /><br />It also shares the same abilities as the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=65321">Wild Crimson Hatchling</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=7544">Crimson Whelping</a> but I would argue that the <i>correct breed</i> of Spawn of Onyxia is significantly stronger due to its stat allocation not being heavily invested in Speed, which is basically useless to this pet.<br /><br />In general you'll want to use the combination of <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=122">Tail Sweep</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=168">Healing Flame</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=170">Lift Off</a>. Tail sweep is exceptionally strong when Spawn of Onyxia is slower than its opponent, so much so that you want to be going last when using this pet.<br /><br />This means the best breed to aim for is #4 (P/P) because any points spent on speed are basically wasted. Breed #10 (P/B) is the second most favourable, and offers a few extra HP at the cost of attack power, but unfortunately still wastes some stats on speed. Breed #8 (P/S) is arguably the weakest.<br /><br />Tactically, this pet works very well against most opponents, and does especially well against faster opponents (almost everything), aquatic and magic families and creatures with flying attacks. It also does well against opponents dependent on big attacks with long cooldowns, because it has two abilities to mitigate such attacks.<br /><br />The key to using this pet well is being able to anticipate enemy actions (pretty much all the daily trainers, Pandarian elemental spirits and beasts of fable are very predictable once you get to know them) - and if you can plan 3-4 moves ahead, the Spawn of Onyxia is exceptionally adept against most opponents.<br /><br />The standard rotation I employ with this little fella is as follows:<br /><br /><ul><li>Open with a Tail Sweep</li><li>If your opponent hit in the first round, follow up with a Healing Flame, or alternatively, if your opponent didn't hit you in the last round, Tail Sweep again and wait a turn to heal once your opponent has actually hit you. Since the Spawn of Onyxia goes second your heal will heal for most of the first 2 attacks</li><li>Lift Off</li><li>Tail Sweep</li><li>Healing Flame</li><li>Tail Sweep until Healing Flame is available again, then start again because all your abilities will be off CD.</li></ul><br /><br />I will however deviate from this rotation when I know my opponent has one or more key abilities.<br /><br />Lift Off is very handy to dodge big attacks. For example use Lift Off on the same round that you know your opponent will use <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=159"> Burrow</a>/<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=564">Dive</a>. Alternatively use it in the round before something like <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/petability=508">Moth Dust</a> (hits hard and has a chance of putting your pet to sleep) or else anything that puts a nasty dot on you.<br /><br />Secondly, because Healing Flame adds additional healing equal to half of the last hit you took, it is often beneficial to time it for the rounds in which you know a big hit will land, but Lift Off is on CD.<br /><br />Thirdly, the dragonkin special ability makes it do serious bonus damage (+50%) in the round after dealing any hit that leaves your opponent below 50% health. However this buff does not reapply itself if it is already active. If it drops off however, hitting an opponent again leaving it below 50% (or dead) will reapply the buff for another round. What this means is that if you trigger this buff with a hit that gets your opponent below 400 or so hp, it is often worth using either Healing Flame followed by a Tail Sweep, or alternative Lift Off, to get the killing blow. This would result in the buff being up for the first round against the next opponent, instead wasting the buff to do 600+ damage to a pet on 200 health.<br /><br />If you are fortunate enough to own an Onyxian Whelpling, teaming it together with a Spawn of Onyxia makes for a duo that can reliably take down most daily trainer teams by themselves without even needing a third pet - meaning you can use them to power level your other pets. Even against teams where this pairing is not ideal, I almost always have a spot for Onyxian Whelpling in my lineup. <br /><br />For people who sadly don't have an Onyxian Whelpling available to them, Spawn of Onyxia is a great substitute, which does almost as well, and you'll definitely be wanting at least 2 of these. I strongly suggest saving a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=92683">Flawless Dragonkin Battle-Stone</a> (or 2) for just this purpose, since farming for a rare of a specific breed can be somewhat time consuming and frustrating.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>1073423</b></h3>I found my rare around the first few days of MoTP hitting stores I can say this you got better chances at a rare by just killing off other non-whelp spawns in one of two ways you could pet battle them or you could just idk use something like a aoe to kill them off just an idea.<br /><br />The way they spawn is just like how there is a limit of herbs &amp; ore that can be spawn in one zone at a time so by removing some of the spawns you crate room for other pet spawns.<br /><br />It took me around 10 trys for my rare which I ended up loving very much due to at <br />Level 25 it's stats are as follows Attack 341, HP 1400 &amp; the speed which I love is 244.<br /><br />This pet makes up speed in power if you got the breed I got.<br /><br />With the breed I got the best move set I think so far is Tail Sweep , Healing Flame &amp; the last 2 moves it can use which are Lift Off &amp; Deep Breath depend on what your going to fight.<br />Lift Off would work wonders on aqua pets along with a nice avoid when it comes to some attacks that take a round to charge &amp; Deep Breath is just raw power when you got a Whelp with 341 attack.<br /><br />Happy farming not much of a guide but I think it should help with a move set up along with a good breed.<br /><br /> Another reason why I like the breed I found is due to Tail Whip with this breed is very very op due to in most cases this pet will hit last meaning if thats the case thats where the 341 attack comes in for a powerful 2 hits per turn as needed.<br /><br />I have helped 2 people so far to get a rare Spawn of Onyxia the 2 people I helped I basicly use what I did to find my first SoO by killing off the other pet spawns in the area to try and make some spawn while they flew around camping the place the two people I helped they said they got their rare within about 5-20 trys of battling them &amp; it was the same breed I had each time I helped someone get it I wonder if there is something to it or just odd chance. <br />this gives you a idea of what the normal amount of chance is when farming this spawn.<br /><br /> Not saying for everyone it's going to take 5-20 trys at it but for some it may take more I think wowhead needed to add a % at how many trys would it take for a rare to spawn.<br /><br />For better chance to get a rare you may wish to try and make friends with people in lower pop realms that are basicly mostly dead such as drak'thron &amp; a few others or just make a alt in places like it &amp; just level it to the point you can farm this spawn no worrys of being killed by the mobs around them &amp; why I think this is a good idea is due to less people farming = greater chance at finding a rare along with making full use of the cross realm areas.<br /><br />It's worth saying for full use of cross realm you need friends in many realms a good way for a easy cross realm farm is have a few friends in differnt dead realms such as Drak'tharon , In one of two ways battle tag or Real id if you want my battle tag due to I got char in drak'thraon due to I like it quite with no one to bug me sometimes just ask for my battle tag and I mail it to you don't want it posted on wowhead I get a million replys due to how many want a easy farming trip for stuff like this meaning my friend list request get so big it crashs something not something I want. <br /><br />Reason on how I think that could happen is to many at once it be like a Ping of Death.<br /><br />Don't hate the cross realm love it for stuff like this.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Reckish</b></h3>Decent alternative that hits exactly as hard is the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=65313">Thundering Serpent Hatchling</a>. Automatically comes as the full power breed, has tail sweep, and lift off. Only big difference is that it's missing the heal, which is a pretty huge deal, but if you don't want to go through the trouble of grinding out a rare, then hey, go to your local guild vendor, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=46602">Shay Pressler</a> or <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=46572">Goram</a>, and pick this little guy up. Last note, while he's rare from the vendor, when you actually learn the pet, it drops down to uncommon, similar to <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=39973">Ghostly Skull</a> (or any other vendor pets).</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Crono666</b></h3>Came across this today after finishing 10m Onyxia (got the reins of Onyxia for a 2nd time when my buddy decided NOT to go with me on the raid when he needed it) and saw the Spawn of Onyxia right outside her lair. First one was a RARE! What luck, caught it without a problem. <br /><br />Good luck to those who hope to get one! I got lucky, hope you do as well.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Castyle</b></h3>At 7:45pm on Area 52 Server, there were 8 of these around Onyxia's Lair, including 2 Uncommons</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Gatekus</b></h3>Finding a Spawn of Onyxia that I could actually tame was frustrating. After scanning the area, I found one pet on the southern side of the cave. What was irritating was that it was impossible to engage the pet in battle; the <i>&quot;Pet battle area is obstructed&quot;</i> message came up regardless of where the dragon flew. The dragon's flight pattern was completely out of synch with the geometry of the surrounding area. At several points, the dragon actually <i>flew directly into the mountain</i>, as though the mountain was not even there. The pet could not be seen, let alone engaged. <br /><br />Eventually, I killed that pet, the only Spawn of Onyxia I could find, in hopes that it would cause another to spawn somewhere else. The tactic worked; on another circuit of the area, I found a Common white had spawned near the cave mouth. I had no problems engaging and capturing this second Spawn. If you encounter the problem I did, perhaps killing the uncapturable pet will cause another pet to spawn elsewhere.<br /><br />On a secondary note, this is just one of many &quot;pet battle area is obstructed&quot; messages I have encountered while trying to battle or capture pets in hilly or mountainous terrain. Considering it has been two years since MOP released, this issue is glaring. <u>Why does Blizzard consistently create pet spawns on terrain that is not suitable for battling?</u> Dustwallow Marsh, Kun-Lai Summit, Grizzly Hills... these are just some of the areas with a high percentage of obstructed battle areas. Over and over I have patiently and methodically engaged multiple pets throughout their entire movement cycle, only to receive the &quot;pet battle area is obstructed&quot; message regardless of where I engage them in that movement cycle. It is an exercise in futility to find a rarely occurring animal and yet be unable to battle it. I am surprised that Blizzard does not take these issues more seriously, and it causes me to question how much they even play their own product.<br /><br />Whatever section of Blizzard is responsible for QAing these pet spawns is ineffective at best and inept at worst. In any other profession, releasing a product that has a high percentage of non-working products is seen as an emergent issue that needs to be fixed immediately, or customers and revenue will be permanently lost. In contrast, Blizzard had had at least 24 months post-release to correct significant issues with pet battling, yet has a taken a unilateral attitude of &quot;We'll fix the issue when we get around to it.&quot; There is no way in hell I could treat customers like that in my profession; I would be fired. <br /><br />Yes, in theory WoW is just a game and not something &quot;serious&quot; like medicine, mechanical engineering, or contracting, but with millions of customers and billions of dollars in revenue over the last ten years, this is more than a game. WoW is a cultural influence. So why does Blizzard not thoroughly QA before release? Why do they expect paying customers to beta test the product for them? Over four years of playing, this uncomfortable conclusion is the one most consistent with the evidence I've seen. Maybe it is just a single Spawn of Onyxia that is poorly coded, but it feels more like an unsettling reminder that a once-trusted company has traded customer loyalty for financial profit. The administration really doesn't care how many customers they lose as long or how use-less the product becomes as their paychecks keep coming in. I got my Spawn of Onyxia, but I won't be coming back for another. If Blizzard continues this trend of putting &quot;uncapturable&quot; pets and sub-par/non-existent QA in Warlords of Draenor, I won't be coming back at all.</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>Nevarii</b></h3>I'm using my <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=93040">Anubisath Idol</a> (since it was level 13 and up to the current level, level 15) when I fight Spawn of Onyxia. His abilities counter her really much: <a href="/pet-ability=406/crush">Crush</a> deals more damage against dragonkin, <a href="/pet-ability=490/deflection">Deflection</a> blocks her <a href="/pet-ability=170/lift-off">Lift-Off</a> which is very useful. When I use him against her I never have to heal him almost, he is sort off tanky and because of <a href="/pet-ability=238/humanoid">Humanoid</a> he self heals a little, and that makes him full hp mostly because Spawn of Onyxia often use either Lift-Off or Healing Flame. If she use <a href="/pet-ability=115/breath">Breath</a> then he can get a little bit damage but not very much.<br />After been defeating Spawn of Onyxia you will be aginst one of those types: critter, aquatic or beast. Again <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=93040">Anubisath Idol</a> is a good choice in this battle because his <a href="/pet-ability=453/sandstorm">Sandstorm</a> deals more damage against aquatic. He is good against a critter as well since they use critter abilities which deal less damage on humanoids. BUT if you meet a beast, you might want to switch him out with another pet in your deck since his crush ability is humanoid and therefore bad against beasts. Isn't a big problem, though.<br /><br />I hope this can help and good luck on farming her :)</div>

<div class="user-post-"><h3 class="heading-size-3">Comment by <b>shrew26</b></h3>Guide to getting your rare without getting any /slaps ;)<br /><br />So we all know that a lot of people want these, some people just want one and dont care if it is rare or not. There is no reason to go around killing other people's chances of getting theirs. To avoid this, <u>but still get your rare pet</u> you can try the following:<br /><br />For me the case with the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62201">Spawn of Onyxia</a> wasn't that I couldn't find spawns, I just couldn't find a RARE spawn. After I captured one green quality pet (just in case I never got around to getting the rare) I used the method below to find the rare:<br /><br /><b>1)</b> Engage in combat and check the battle pets rarity. If it isn't your rare, surrender the battle.<br /><b>2)</b> Your pets will take some damage but it is a small amount.<br /><b>3)</b> Put a target marker on the mob you just checked after it re-spawns from your surrendered battle (it will re-spawn shortly if you did not damage it in battle)<br /><b>4)</b> Repeat this process until your equipped battle pets are low in health, and use a battle pet bandage to heal up (or your healing CD)<br /><br />The markers help so you dont check the same one more than once. I usually start with star and cycle down to skull. This method probably wont work with really highly camped stuff like the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=62317/minfernal">Minfernal</a> but it is a good method for other pets like this one or seasonal spawns. <br />I know this method takes a bit more time and effort but fellow pet collectors will appreciate it.</div>
